The Good:
1. Location
2. Beach 
3. Clean

The bad:
1. Annoying beach security staff. Although we were swimming inside the designated area, the beach guard was constantly whistling and screaming at us.
2. All the hotel stuff gathered at the beach at afternoon to play team building games. As a guest I wanted to relax at the beach and the hotel stuff were shouting, screaming and even laid down at our sunbeds while our personal stuff were still there. 
3. Pool. The water at the pools was extremely hot and it was basically impossible enjoy a refreshing swim. 
4. Soft drinks and beers are extremely overpriced at this hotel

msg:This time, I took my child out for five days and four nights. Overall, it was very good. The hotel has a lot of things to do and eat. There are beaches and seas outside the hotel. You can lie down for a whole day. It is a stress-free hotel for bringing children! 
Hotel: I booked a sea view room. When I checked in, I talked to Vita at the front desk and helped to upgrade the parent-child sea view room for free. The children liked it very much and it was also very spacious; the water in the hotel was a bit unexpected. I thought it would be served with some tea (previously, I would have black tea, green tea, etc.); I bought some value-added services of the hotel. Except for the indoor game coins, the others seemed to be useless. The cost of value-added services is not recommended. You can buy them at the hotel according to your needs. Many services are provided by the hotel when you check in. It is very pleasant to have afternoon tea in the lobby bar;
Children's facilities in the hotel: The favorite is the swimming pool, and there is also an indoor children's playground. You can let them roam there after returning from the beach at noon and take a rest; stroll around the scarecrow manor After a tour, there were a lot of mosquitoes, so I didn't stay long;
Food: The hotel has a variety of cuisines, which are pretty standard. My child especially likes Thai roasted pork neck. You can order food to eat in the room at noon, which is very convenient. The hotel basically takes care of lunch at noon because it's too hot; for dinner, we went out to the commercial area next to us to eat coconut chicken and dregs vinegar hot pot. I didn't feel very ordinary (the chicken was not bad). The hotel's seafood buffet at night was pleasant, but there were a lot of bugs. I had to chase them away while eating;
Ocean World: I have always wanted to go to the Ocean World when I go to Sanya, so I chose to go to the Atlantis Aquarium. It's a bit far, and it takes an hour to take a taxi back and forth. My child only saw it for half an hour and then left. The venue is small, so I took two photos (78 negatives per photo) as a souvenir, but I don't recommend it.

It has its own private beach, a whole large lawn, and the blue sky, white clouds and the sea. It is really a great photo! The children's activities are also very full, and my baby has a lot of fun every day. The hotel breakfast is also well received, with a rich variety. I especially like their different Hainan noodles every day. I think it tastes better than the ones sold outside. Finally, I want to praise their Thai food. There is a reason why so many people praise it. I strongly recommend Tom Yum Goong soup. I drank three or four bowls in a row! It's so delicious!

The hotel is also very close to the Baihua Valley Commercial Street. I recommend Nongzai inside. I went in blindly. I feel that his family has not done any promotion, but it is surprisingly delicious! I ate two meals in a row!

msg:Our whole family went out and booked a family suite. The garden and mountain views outside the window were very good. The room was large enough and the space planning was very reasonable. The two bathrooms were divided into two sections for convenient bathing. There was a clothes drying rack on the balcony. Due to the climate in Sanya, we had to change several sets of clothes every day when we took the kids out to play. The hotel has Thai restaurants, Chinese restaurants, Western restaurants, Korean restaurants... which can meet everyone's diverse dietary needs. The housekeeper Bella was very considerate and sent us a lot of fruits. The children were very happy. The hotel arranged a variety of activities for the children, such as fishing and catching shrimps and children's king activities, which were all pretty good. Beach toys were also provided for free, and small crabs could be caught on the beach in the backyardü•≥.

msg:I still have feelings for Mangrove Forest. We also stayed here when we took wedding photos. Eight years have passed and we are now a family of three. We almost didn't consider other places when we came to Hainan this time and booked it directly. Although it took a long time to think about it, I still feel very good in all aspects. The housekeeper Wendy is also very considerate. Since the baby is still young (2 years old), she kept asking if there were any needs during the stay, which is very considerate. It is a first-class environment for taking care of children, and the cost-effectiveness is very high. I hope to come here every year in the future. Thank you Mangrove Forest for giving us the warmth of home

In general, the hotel is suitable for a family holiday; the area is always noisy and there are a lot of children. There are very few sunbeds by the pool, they are constantly occupied by towels of guests who have reserved their places in the morning))))

The only drawback is that the swimming pool is not deep enough. If you are with children under 10 years old, then Mangrove is a good choice. It would be even better if you can get a sea view room.

The service is really speechless.
If you don't ask, the services provided by Ctrip are not available.
If you ask, it is either a hook to continue consumption,
or you are directly told that it is gone, and there is no compensation or explanation.
There is a schedule for parent-child activities, but there is actually nothing,
and then you are asked to pay for the activities you want to play.
Because I later changed to Sheraton,
I can see that the management of mangroves is really not good after comparison.

The hotel handled it with humanistic care and arranged a car to take me to the hospital and the airport. That‚Äôs it. Anyway, I can‚Äôt ask for too much for this price, so that‚Äôs it.

As soon as I entered the hotel, I could see the sea in the distance across the dining table. The scenery was very beautiful and the environment was elegant. The lady at the front desk helped me upgrade the room type for free when I checked in. I could enjoy the white sand beach and the sea directly from the balcony. It was a surprise. The service staff was very thoughtful and helped with the luggage. I was also very satisfied with the photo shoot I made for the next day. It was just that the waves were too big to go to the sea these two days. I just played in the swimming pool, which was a pity.

I am very grateful to the housekeeper Xing Zhenglong for arranging a room on the top floor facing the sea for me according to my request before I arrived. The view from the room is really unbeatable. Please refer to the video.
2. Mangrove is indeed a bit old. Although the facilities are not so technologically advanced, they are completely sufficient. I carefully observed that each room has a balcony and can dry clothes. The hotel also provides clothes drying racks, which is really great for mothers.
3. My husband and I walked from the beach of Mangrove to MGM to feel the quality of the sand. I wanted to continue walking forward, but I couldn't get off when I reached MGM. It is indeed as the online reviews say that the beach is really the best in Tianyu and Mangrove.
4. I really like the scenery of the public area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMangrove, all All of them are in my aesthetic point, refer to the pictures
5. The hotel provides free rental services for many items. We experienced clothes drying racks, bath salts, toilet water, razors, and the service was timely and convenient
6. The air conditioner did not cool, the toilet had a peculiar smell, and there were creatures mentioned in the comments. We did not encounter any of them. We stayed for 5 nights and the experience was very good
7. I think the Thai restaurant is average. It may be because I have eaten Michelin in Bangkok. I don‚Äôt feel it is amazing and the price is expensive
8. It is very close to Baihua, only 10 minutes walk, and it is also very convenient to order takeout. It will be delivered to the takeout cabinet. The takeout cabinet is only 5 minutes away from the hotel lobby, not as far away as mentioned in the comments
9. A few suggestions: The quality and variety of breakfast can be improved, and the spirit of the waiters should also be improved. It always gives people a feeling of lack of energy

There were two more surprises this time. One was that the buffet dinner on the beach actually had more fresh seafood and blue crabs, as well as thoughtful butler-style service.

I found that its decoration, service, and facilities are not as good as the 70 yuan hotel I stayed in on the last day to catch the plane. The external environment is OK, but that's all. It relies on the location to make money. Sooner or later, it will become 300 yuan per room. The private beach of this hotel is very beautiful, but there are many hotels of the same price nearby that are both good inside and outside. Why choose this hotel that only looks worth 300 yuan?

You can get a towel with your room card, lie down and watch the tides of the sea, watch the children playing and frolicking, close your eyes and take a nap, and feel particularly relaxed. The hotel has a heated swimming pool, which can be used for free. It is supervised by a dedicated person and is safe and clean. The hotel is somewhat like a Thai hotel style. It is very pleasant to stay. It is recommended to take your children to relax for a few days without going to any attractions. The hotel has Thai restaurants, barbecue bars, afternoon tea, Chinese food, etc. The prices are relatively expensive. There are places to eat and shop within one kilometer nearby, which are moderately priced and rich in variety. The mountain view room I stayed in was cheaper. Although I couldn't see the sea view in the room, it was extremely quiet and I woke up to the birdsong in the morning.

My little friend liked Super Wings very much and said he would sleep in a tent at night. In addition, the swimming pool and beach are great, and the baby is very happy playing in the water. Unfortunately, I stay in the room and work overtime and can't spend much time with her. Grandma took Xiaobao to the Scarecrow Farm, where there are rabbits, peacocks and other small animals, as well as various tropical fruit trees such as jackfruit. There were many foreigners staying in the same hotel, and the baby also met at the Scarecrow Farm. The four-and-a-half-year-old boy had a lively chat with the foreigner who was fishing and even played with the two fish the other party caught. . . The Ctrip package we bought included a coconut chicken hot pot, which was very fragrant and tender. Rachel, the housekeeper, arranged to deliver a fruit to the room to avoid the trouble of buying it outside. . I felt noisy when I stayed in other hotels a few days ago. This hotel perfectly combines environmental comfort and convenience. It was really comfortable to lie on the beach loungers or coconut grove hammocks. We didn‚Äôt even want to leave after our stay.

msg:This time I chose Mangrove. There were some small disputes before checking in because no refunds were allowed after booking Mangrove, so there was some friction, but in the end I decided to come. I hope everyone will read it carefully before booking! Secondly, let me talk about my feelings. Before I came here, I saw a lot of bad reviews online, which were about the hotel‚Äôs old facilities and service. After checking in, my first feeling was that I was lucky not to cancel!
Environment: Let‚Äôs talk about the environment first. I really like the hotel environment of Mangrove. I personally like the overall design and planning of Mangrove. I came here in the off-season of March. The premium sea view room costs an average of 1,000 yuan per night. For this price, it‚Äôs okay. Accept it, but the room lacks a bathtub. This room type would be more perfect if it had a bathtub, but I also accept it!
Facilities: Secondly, many people say that the hotel is old. In fact, I understand that the entire hotel is in Southeast Asian style, with more wooden structures. I don‚Äôt think the facilities are very old, it is just the style of Southeast Asia!
Service: Finally, in terms of service, nothing happened during this trip that made me feel that the service was not good, and I personally agree with it! I will stay in Mangrove Forest again next time and bring my family with me!

The hotel has a full range of family-friendly entertainment facilities and a comprehensive range of Chinese, Western, Korean and Thai restaurants. This time, there is a store anniversary discount, which is very good. It is very comfortable to go to the beach in the morning and evening to enjoy the breeze and step on the water. It‚Äôs considered off-season now. There are still many tourists in Yalong Bay (the close P is removed from the photo). The name of the best bay in the world is worthy of its name. There are more people in the hotel. There are still queues at the door during the breakfast rush. This is the only time I encountered this while driving around the island. I was amazed. The front desk helped arrange a satisfactory room when I checked in. Thank you.

In particular, I would like to commend the housekeeper Rachel for her meticulous work, attentive service, and responsiveness to our requests. She booked tickets for us to Pinang Valley and a free shuttle bus. There was also a tour guide for us. We were given a welcome fruit when we checked in, and a colorful necklace souvenir before we left. I liked it very much!

The heated swimming pool is the highlight. It was a bit cold when you first entered, but you'll get better once you get used to it. The water is very clear and clean. Children especially like it and it is very safe. The beach of the sea is fine, the waves are not big, and the water is clear. The night sky is beautiful. In fact, several star hotels are secondary. What is truly worthwhile is the beauty of nature. The service staff are very enthusiastic.
The only thing I would like to comment on is the breakfast buffet which costs over 100 yuan. Love the hand-cut bread. There are also many dishes. It just feels like it lacks the exquisite and high-end feel of five-star hotel dishes. The bean curd is good, but the braised pork may be a bit bland for some Northeasterners. Making braised noodles is almost boring. A large pot of small oranges, the skin is so rotten. The watermelon slices are extremely small.
You have to take care of your belongings by yourself. Don't forget anything when leaving the store. Because of the peak period for check-out, the service staff was very busy. You have to wait a long time to find something. You may not be able to find it yet. I mistakenly thought that the power bank was left in the room. After waiting for a long time, I couldn't find it because I was too busy and no one paid attention. I forgot to look for Rachel. Fortunately, I finally found her in the corner of my backpack. A false alarm. Fortunately, I didn't bother her.

I have already made a detailed review, so I won‚Äôt go into details here, just write a few sentences.
Needless to say, the Thai food is delicious and the service is better. I think it‚Äôs better to forget about the buffet at the beach and eat Thai food and Chinese restaurants. I would also like to give a special mention to the amazing waiter Chen Yongqiang who welcomes you. No matter what you say, he always smiles. No matter whether it is something within his scope or not, as long as you come to him, he will try his best to help you solve it. If you can't solve it, he will help you find it. The management staff tried to find a way. No matter how you yell at him, he just smiles. This is the service of a five-star hotel. I hope Yongqiang can be promoted to a higher position. The people are really nice. The hotel has a beautiful view. I will stay there next time. Come

msg:I decided to go to Sanya on the spur of the moment and booked Mangrove Forest in a hurry. It was very late that day when we arrived at the hotel, and the wind was very strong. At that time, I thought that Sanya was not warm at all. Stayed for a few days and found that I really liked it. First of all, the beautiful environment, whether it is the Scarecrow Farm or the unobstructed view of the sea, makes me relaxed and happy. The design of the hotel is retro style, and many of the designs are open, so the wind blows in your face wherever you go. I ate Thai food in a Chinese restaurant and a Western restaurant in a few days. I was satisfied with the service and delicious food. I especially ate the coconut chicken rice in the Western restaurant several times. The breakfast was also rich and delicious. Especially the environment of Han Xuan was the most comfortable for breakfast. The scenery in the tea restaurant is also very beautiful. In the hotel, whether it is the waiter who greets you at the door, the waiter who cleans the room, the farmer at the Scarecrow Farm, or any hotel staff passing by, they all nod in a friendly manner. All of these are wonderful memories for me except the good weather in Sanya. Finally, I would like to say that the young man at the front desk who received me that day, Huang Haixiang, was very skilled in his work. After checking in, he even took the initiative to help me deliver my suitcase to the door of the room. During this period, I went to the front desk to consult with him several times if I had any questions, and he solved them quickly, which left a very good impression on me. By the way, the Filipino singers in the beach restaurant sing very well. At night, you can sit on the swing bench nearby and listen to their singing. It‚Äôs a very good memoryüëç

There are restaurants and restaurants about 10 minutes' walk in both directions of the hotel, which is very convenient. The hotel is a place to stay with children. The Island Master Paradise is popular with children. There are two outdoor pools for swimming and playing in the water. One swimming pool is 25 meters long and has a water depth of 1.2m. One is an outdoor water park, which is quite large. There is a slide for my children to play on their own, and the staff also opened it. There is no indoor swimming pool. The Scarecrow Farm in the hotel has a variety of animals and plants, which adds to the fun of travel. I will choose it again next time, the transportation is also convenient. The overall feeling is good.

Since the hotel was oversold, this room type was no longer available. Then they offered to change me to a suite. I went in and took a look. It turned out to be a parent-child room for children. After communication to no avail, I called Ctrip and was able to solve the problem and change the room. Didn't receive an apology during the entire stay. I strongly do not recommend this service. This kind of service awareness is definitely worth reflecting on.

In addition, the success of a hotel is the joint efforts of all staff. Cleaning, luggage, chefs, housekeepers, and the front desk are all indispensable, so I won‚Äôt praise them individually. A comfortable stay, delicious food, and relaxing beach time make up the perfect vacation.

The hotel has a strategic location, the rooms are simple and elegant, and the service is good. This time I came here with my friends for vacation. I booked a room online. After checking in at the front desk, I found that the room was inconsistent with the room I booked online. I went to the front desk to consult, but the front desk couldn't explain it clearly. I asked to check out and choose another hotel, but the front desk staff refused to cancel. There is no solution for the room, which is infuriating! Later, after the hotel housekeeper Pony RaChel learned about the situation, the problem was quickly and reasonably resolved. I really admire Ms. Ma's ability to handle problems and act decisively and neatly! Very satisfying! The Mangrove Hotel's long-lasting reputation may be due to the outstanding work and dedication of elites like Xiao Ma!

This is the third time I have stayed at a five-star hotel in Yalong Bay, Sanya. The Mangrove Hotel is a relatively old hotel. The interior decoration is a bit simple. I wonder if we are building a frugal hotel now? There is no disposable shampoo, shower gel, or moisturizer. There are only two large bottles, one shower gel and one shampoo. However, the cap is not easy to press and it is difficult to press. But the customer service girl Rachel was very enthusiastic and attentive, and delivered welcome fruits in a timely manner. Due to the problem of using the hair dryer, a waiter was immediately called to teach me. It turns out that the hair dryer can recognize the socket, which is a new knowledge. üòÑ

You can feel the bright sunshine during the day, enjoy the romance of the starry sky at night, and experience the luxurious sea view and never forget to leave. A very satisfying stay experience! The breakfast is rich and the taste can be improved. The facilities are very user-friendly and there is a wireless network that can be connected, but the signal is not stable. The takeout will be delivered to the yellow takeout cabinet at the door outside the hotel. It's not far or close. It would be perfect if it could be placed downstairs.

It was more spacious and cuter. I was kindly asked if I needed it. Fences are installed, and basic luggage can be sent back to the room.
The hotel environment is also good. The large swimming pool is open until ten o'clock in the evening. You can privately enjoy the huge beach and coastline of Yalong Bay. It is beautiful.
The hotel's buffet breakfast has a full range of varieties, including porridge, noodles, various dishes, and Western-style breads and desserts. Our baby loves their biscuits. The waiter Long Xinyi also thoughtfully sent us fruit to the room. Superb!
I saw that the hotel also has a variety of activities for children, and the learning + play arrangements are clear and clear, which made me happy. I will continue to develop when our baby gets older ~

Experience the King of Island Owners for an hour, and you can get an extra bed and breakfast for free if you go again, which is especially suitable for families with two children.
Stay in a double room with sea view, and upgrade to a junior suite later (unfortunately, it cannot be upgraded for free)
The room layout is different, with a 180-degree sea view. I stayed in 2611 7 years ago. The extra bed was quickly added and the waiter's attitude was very good and pleasant.
It was my birthday today, and the hotel sent me a cake, which tasted really good.
Activities were arranged on the lawn during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The children took a small train to the park and took photos with the Big Gray Wolf and the Big Frog. They were very excited.
Everyone is saying that Yalong Bay has been half destroyed after the government filled it with sand. By comparison, the quality is indeed poor. The sand on the seaside side of the beach is about one or two meters thick and contains impurities. Children have to wear shoes to step on it. It is the same when near the sea. Later I went to live in Sanya Bay and I think the two bays are better compared to each other. Generally speaking, this shortcoming of Yalong Bay is not worth mentioning. You must choose Yalong Bay for vacation (for families with children)

The coconut grove and sea view in the hotel are pleasant. There are indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds. There are also a variety of parent-child activities. Especially the fishing activities at the Scarecrow Farm are very special. You can have fun for a few days in the hotel. The Thai food in the set meal is exquisite, exceeding expectations. The housekeeper, Lucy, is warm and thoughtful, and the service is considerate. A perfect vacation.

There are also staff on the beach to ensure safety, and it is not possible to go into the sea due to strong winds and waves. The swimming pool is also very good, and the children like the sea and the swimming pool very much. The buffet breakfast is rich in variety, and the Thai restaurant is ranked first in Sanya. It is very close to Baihua Valley, just a walk away, and it is convenient to buy daily necessities and eat. Looking forward to next year's trip, looking forward to next year's Yalong Bay mangroves!

msg:Because the child was sick and booked the hotel on the first day of departure, the closer the departure date was, the more expensive the room price was. The price of the hotel I saw before had risen ridiculously. Seeing that the price increase of the mangrove house was acceptable, I booked the mangrove. The mangrove forest is indeed older, but the vegetation coverage is high, and the coconut forest sea view is very beautiful. The hotel is very close to the Baihuagu commercial street, and the problem of eating is easy to solve. The service attitude of the hotel is also very good, and any needs can be solved in time. When entering and leaving the store, someone will take the initiative to carry luggage and open the door. The breakfast in the hotel is very rich, and I haven't gotten tired of eating it for three days, which is very satisfying. For breakfast, the price for children under 1.5 meters seems to be 68 yuan. Except for the old wooden parts in the room, everything else is fine. There are showers on the balcony and indoors, which is very convenient. It takes less than 3 minutes to walk from the room to the beach, and the children are very happy. The beach is sandy enough for those of us who don't often play in the sea. Finally, the water quality of the swimming pool needs to be improved, and the overall staying experience is not bad.

msg:After 12 years, I chose Mangrove to stay again. At first, I hesitated and saw some negative comments on the Internet about the old hotel facilities and dark interior lighting. Personal check-in experience is as follows: the check-in time is indeed a bit long, and everyone is inevitably a little emotional in the sweltering environment. I hope the hotel can improve the check-in efficiency. The originally booked luxury double-bed suite with sea view has been changed to the manager's suggestion. A small suite with a big bed and an extra bed is indeed a wise choice, and the extra bed in this suite will not look too cramped. For a family of three, if the child's height exceeds 165cm, the sofa is not enough. Buy a Breakfast vouchers for 128 people. The sea view on the balcony is beautiful, and the hotel's service is also meticulous. After adding the manager's WeChat, some small requests can be responded quickly. When entering the room, the decoration does not feel shabby, but it is very comfortable. The hotel style is Southeast Asian style, and the indoor lighting is good for children to learn. no problem. The hotel's swimming pool and restaurant can meet the vacation needs of lazy people. In addition, the buffet breakfast, Korean food and Thai restaurant can meet the needs of friends who do not have high taste requirements, and the price is more affordable than twelve years ago. Generally speaking, this price is quite competitive in Yalong Bay. Next time I have a chance, I will choose mangroves.

The facilities are really old and very old.
The service attitude is still very good.
The worst three points, one: The takeaway self-pickup cabinet is 50 or 60 meters away from the lobby, and the whole time is exposed to the sun. You can get a tan with every meal.
Two: A small bottle of Heineken beer in a Chinese restaurant sells for 46 or 48. It‚Äôs too dark. If you sell it for 48 in a bar, it‚Äôs fine. A Chinese restaurant still sells small bottles. I don‚Äôt know what you think of customers. The big bottle of Mangrove Thai Restaurant in Sanya Bay only sells for 15.
Third: There is a small supermarket in the hotel. Liquor, beer and drinks are not allowed to be sold, only some dairy products are sold.
Your intentions are too obvious.
From then on, I will not go there again, it is far worse than the mangroves in Sanya Bay. 1700 for one night, only two bottles of ice dew water, only two adults for breakfast, and 68 for children to buy meals. Sanya Bay Mangrove 1000 for one night, breakfast for two and two small, including water world. I don't know why such an old facility like yours charges such a high price. . .

The most dissatisfied is here , the price/performance ratio is extremely low, but the price of a five-star hotel is only 100-200 for the room, especially at night, the room lighting is very dim, I feel that the inside of the room is not clear, the room facilities are old and old, the bedside table and the bathroom are placed The lower layer of the towels is all dusty, and there are no other bright spots besides being close to the sea. I originally planned to take the children out to play in a parent-child hotel, but it turned out to be a big disappoin**ent. I really don‚Äôt know what is the highlight of a parent-child hotel? There is a charge for everything in the hotel except the room, and there is a charge for the swimming ring in the swimming pool. There is a shop selling swimwear in the hotel. The price is scary. You can buy a pair of children's swimming goggles for 159 yuan, but the quality is only 30 yuan outside. It‚Äôs 1 yuan, I feel that the hotel is falling into the eyes of the money. The price of more than 1,000 feels like being cheated. The children advertised on the Internet have nothing to play with. Except for a swimming pool slide, there is also a pitifully small outdoor children‚Äôs playground. There is nothing other than an underground paradise. In short, I will not choose this hotel

As long as you turn on the lights in the house, you can see clearly from the swimming pool outside and look into the room. I dare not turn on the bathroom lights during the day, and I dare not turn them on at night. The gap is so big, it looks beautiful and artistic. , but too uncomfortable? ! The TV screen projection in the room was a failure. After a long time of research, it failed, so I gave up decisively.
Hygiene: Do not open the top shower to the maximum in the shower room, otherwise the whole bathroom will be flooded with water. There is no cushioning effect when the toilet is closed, so be sure to handle it with care. On the last day of my stay, I found damp bugs on the sink. I didn't see them in the room, so I don't know if they exist. There will be a damp smell in the room when you enter the door, which is understandable, after all, there is a swimming pool outside. In the afternoon, I opened the back door and saw a big gecko. Around 6 o'clock in the evening, the snail family was about to act in groups. It was a disaster. Heideng Xiahuo When walking by the pool, you must pay attention to your feet, maybe you will trample a life to death.
Service: The hotel butler is very good, and the room service is nothing to say. Breakfast for children under 140cm is half price.
The coastal beach here is particularly difficult for feet, the sand is relatively thick, and there are some passenger garbage packages. For dinner, you can go to Baihua Valley and walk for 10 minutes.
Generally speaking, the hotels here in Yalong Bay don‚Äôt want to go to the sea except for the swimming pool. The fun is average, not as interesting as Dadonghai and Houhai Village.

msg:The whole decoration of the room feels shabby, and the garden room feels like a Hanting Hotel, with nothing but a bed. The point is that this hotel is very powerful. I booked a room for 3 nights online and was told to check out early. No matter how I tried to communicate, I was not given a refund. The prepayment for early check out will be deducted in full. There is absolutely no room for negotiation. There was no service attitude throughout the whole process, it was just coercion, a do-what-you-can-do-to-me attitude. And in fact, the hotel is mainly a family hotel, but there are few actual parent-child activities. The outdoor constant-temperature swimming pool is actually the water temperature of the ambient temperature, and the water depth is 1.2 meters. It is not suitable for playing with children at all. The overall environment and price/performance ratio are worse than those of hotels in the same price range in Haitang Bay. Too many and not recommended at all. . .

The pictures show the actual interior and exterior of the hotel. There is a beach right outside the door, with lounge chairs, perfect for lazy people walking their kids. Come again next time if you have a chance!

msg:The mangrove forest is still very good, tropical rainforest style, the environment is very good and beautiful, when the weather is good, it is very good, the big lawn is very open, very suitable for small pots to run. The sand in Yalong Bay is generally thicker than that in Sanya Bay. However, the sand in the beach area of the hotel is finer than the one next door, especially the beach in the area connected to the sea. The sea in Yalong Bay is really beautiful, clearer and bluer. The hotel‚Äôs atoll swimming pool is more distinctive, suitable for bringing a small basin Friends play, children's water slide is also fun. There was a small episode during the stay. Thanks to Ctrip's director Xiao Wu, who helped to communicate with the hotel quickly and effectively and upgraded the room type, which greatly improved the experience of staying. It is still very reassuring to book a hotel through Ctrip There is also the hotel's housekeeper, Rachel, who is also very warm and considerate. He actively helps to communicate and solve problems during the stay. If you book a family suite for a family trip, it is recommended to book a family sea view suite. The room is very bright and spacious, and the overall facilities are also updated. The experience is better than that of a garden The room is too good. The hotel is quite discreet. The room also has matching toiletries and bathrobes for children. The hotel's Chinese food, Thai food and seafood barbecue buffet are all good. The breakfast Bao Luo powder is delicious, especially the dried squid as an ingredient After checking out, the little friend also received a souvenir, very happy~ The overall experience this time is still very good, the mangrove forest is worth 2 brushes next time~

You can go to the hotel next door from the beach. It is a short distance from Baihuagu Commercial The street is 10 minutes walk, and the traffic is very convenient. In short, this time when I brought my children to stay, I arranged for an afternoon to take the bus arranged by the hotel to the duty-free shop, and stayed in the hotel for the rest of the time, whether it was the beach, the swimming pool or various parent-child activities. The beasts had a special time here. happy.

Environment: I live in a garden-view room on the second floor, which is fine during the day, but at night there is a strong smell of barbecue on the lawn opposite. The whole hotel has a good view, walking down the pool is the beach. There are few people on this beach, so I had a lot of fun. There are also shades and deck chairs, which saved the lives of parents with babies. The hotel has a scarecrow farm with geese, peacocks, pigeons, and various vegetable fields; the entrance of the hotel is densely wooded and very quiet.

Service: The butler Rachel is very considerate. She added WeChat after check-in, sent a list of various hotel activities, asked us how our stay was going halfway, and sent a piece of fruit. The overall service of the hotel is very goodüëç

The seafood buffet has a live band, and the a**osphere with the sea view is very good, but the taste is quite ordinary. The buffet breakfast There are many types, but the taste is a bit poor for a five-star hotel.
Next to the hotel is a scarecrow farm where you can feed small animals and go fishing, which is more suitable for families with children.
The heated swimming pool is a bit small, and it is really noisy when there are many children. After swimming, I want to lie down and bask in the sun, and I am directly disturbed and go to the beach. Then there are all kinds of sellers, wild photographers, and promotional items on the beach. It‚Äôs a bit bother.
Check-in at the front desk during the peak period is relatively slow, but the service attitude is not bad. The butler Rachel is very nice, and she is patient with any problems. In the end, she even helped to delay the check-out. Not bad, not bad, recommended!

Environment: The check-in experience is also very good. In addition to the swimming pool that the hotel already has, there is also a private beach for everyone to play. There are also many recreational items on the beach. It is also very convenient to go to the surrounding food courts, and it only takes five minutes to walk!

Next time I come to Sanya, I will continue to consider staying at Yalong Bay Mangrove!

The staff in the garden are very polite and say hello every time they meet. After check-in, the housekeeper added WeChat to provide full service. It may be that the occupancy rate was relatively high after the epidemic, and the rooms came out relatively late, and the check-in was very slow, and some guests were in a hurry. I also feel that the work efficiency is a bit low, and I hope the hotel can improve work efficiency. There is no conditioner in the bathroom and the hair dryer doesn't work well. The next day the housekeeper asked me about my check-in experience and gave me a truthful feedback. I wanted to send us a piece of fruit to the room to apologize, but I waited for an hour until check-out and it was not deliveredüò≥ It shows how inefficient this is. There are few varieties of breakfast, and it is not as rich as Tianyu. I hope to improve it. The housekeeper contacted me later and kept apologizing, saying what to do next time, and looking forward to having better memories for the next stay!

msg:I came here because of the white sand and small waves in Yalong Bay, but I can't get close to the big waves these days, so I won't comment on the sea. Talk about the beach, the beach is full of cigarette butts, there are really a lot of them, it is very annoying. There are also sand-digging toys left behind by the children that are not needed by the tourists. There are many sand-digging toys on the beach at night, which is not environmentally friendly. I hope the hotel can provide them for free. It is convenient for guests to borrow them with the room card, and it is also environmentally friendly. Within two minutes on the beach, someone asked, do you want coconuts, popsicles, Liangpi, children's beach electric cars, don't even think about staying quietly for a while. I live in a garden view room where peacocks will sing once every 10 minutes at midnight. If you don‚Äôt sleep well, you have to be careful. The most annoying thing is that you came to the constant temperature swimming pool. It turned out to be as cold as a normal swimming pool. I‚Äôm very angry. This month, the water is really real very cold. Before leaving, the hotel called to ask for opinions on the hotel and said to send some tropical fruits. They said they would send tropical fruits, but they sent oranges and apples. The tropical fruits were two mini mangoes, one black-hearted dragon fruit, and one The little Lianwu feels very shabby, I blush for such a big hotel, you don't have to give it away, why bother. The hotel is not cheap either. Except for the cold swimming pool, slides, and the particularly smelly duck peacock, which is called a small zoo, everything else is charged, and there is a charge for borrowing swimming rings. By the way, the swimming pool is really dirty. It is not comparable to the hotel swimming pool I stayed in Sanya Bay. There is not even a small water slide for children to play. It is just a cold water swimming pool. I don‚Äôt understand the two things between this hotel and parent-child What does the word matter.

The beach in front of the hotel seems to be privately owned by the hotel, not too crowded, very nice! The breakfast is rich, the restaurant environment is very good, and you can eat directly looking at the sea. The only thing that needs to be improved is that when I got the room card, I met a novice at the front desk. I couldn't find my reservation with my name for a long time, and finally found it with the reservation number. The hotel staff need to strengthen training.

I think it is an outdoor hot spring. Children feel hot. It is more fun to play in the atoll swimming pool at room temperature every afternoon. The bathroom has three separations, but the glass between the shower room and the toilet is transparent, why not make frosted glass? The privacy of the bathtub is poor, but I didn't use it. The hotel is covered in green, and it's generally good. There are a lot of people for breakfast, and you need to queue up after 9 o'clock. Very close to the beach, the hotel's food is expensive and unpalatable, takeaway is very convenient

msg:One of the oldest hotels in Yalong Bay. So the disadvantage is that it occupies the smallest area and has the oldest facilities. However, the environment and service can still meet the standard it should have, which is slightly inferior to the hotels next door. It can be said that it occupies the C position in Yalong Bay, the widest and best quality beachüèñ The room is generally small, the facilities are old, and even the toilet seat does not have a damper. I keep forgetting to put it down slowly, which scares me for a while . Most of the sea view rooms have a side view, and only the sea view suites are facing the sea. The design of the public area is not as a**ospheric as the new hotels next door, which is a bit cramped. There are not too many guests staying. I waited for a long time for checkin, and the room still hasn‚Äôt come out after 15 o‚Äôclock. I promised to call and notify, but there was no notification. After wandering in the garden for more than an hour, I still took the initiative to ask, saying that I forgot . It shows that the efficiency still needs to be further improved. The area of the lawn is particularly large. Because of this, the area of the outdoor swimming pool is compressed. Compared with MGM and Tianyu, the mangrove is dominated by green tones when viewed from the air. Activities and entertainment facilities are also slightly less. And there are many business activities. On the first night, there was a company celebration, singing and dancing until after nine o'clock in the evening, and the ears were tortured for four hours. I think the feelings of the guests should be considered. The breakfast variety is not rich, but the service and order are OK. The environment of the western restaurant is very good, but the coffee machine is only a small one. After making a few cups, you have to deal with adding water and wait for a long time. The hotel also has several Thai and Korean restaurants that are great in terms of environment and taste, I like it! The lobby bar is very comfortable, with a good view and a comfortable environment. The most important thing is that the afternoon tea is very good and delicious! The price of group coupons is much lower, it may be the most cost-effective afternoon tea in all hotels, recommended for wall cracks! Parking is free and beach activities are available. The night view is good at night. Except for the front desk, the overall service is okay, but there is still room for improvement. The layout of the rooms also has room for improvement in terms of details. There should also be some adjus**ents in the public areas. I have always maintained an objective attitude in my reviews. As an older hotel, it should make use of its strengths and avoid weaknesses, and focus on features and service quality in order to gain an advantage in the industry group. I don't think it is necessary to use public name-calling and praise as an employee performance assessment, and it doesn't have any good impression on the guests! The staff named Bella was warm and thoughtful when I checked out, and I was really impressed by the fact that I was given fruit as a gift, but this is the service standard that the hotel should meet. I don‚Äôt want to do it for performance evaluation. Naturally integrated into the subconscious of employees. As for why Mangrove was chosen among so many hotels in the end, it is still the price advantage when booking in advance. However, compared horizontally, I still have reservations about the overall cost performance. I hope that there will be considerable improvement and development in the future, no matter in terms of hardware or soft power, to attract more hotel guests.

It is really not recommended to stay in the Pigman Family Room. It is backed by the sun, the room is very cool, and the view is not spacious, and the room is rather cramped. At that time, I decided to upgrade. The room, but there is no room. I booked an upgraded room with the housekeeper for the next day and agreed. No one contacted me the next day. I went to the front desk for consultation after 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Fortunately, the lady took care of it immediately. Thank you very much, the view of the upgraded room is much wider! The room is also 10 flat. So before checking in, you still need to know the room situation first.
The hotel is close to the sea, it is really convenient to go to the beach, and the sea water is very clean and clear!
The hotel has a variety of restaurants, and the taste is also good.
It is also very close to the commercial street, at most 6 minutes on foot, it is very lively at night, you can go and have a look.
Overall 4 stars, because the feeling of staying in the first night was really not very good. Others are okay.

You can eat on the balcony if you order takeaway. There are not too many mosquitoes. I have been bitten by three bags in three days. It feels like the most friendly trip I have ever made.
Service: I must praise the little brother of the lifeguard. After my son lost the swimming ring, he rescued the baby in the first time. The baby was less than 1.2, and he was rescued after struggling in the water of 1.2 for three seconds. Strong praise! ! ! Speaking of the lack of 1.2, all the buffets are free. My baby is very satisfied with the seafood buffet at night. I have never eaten boiled sea fish before, and my baby loves it.
Eat, in addition to the buffet, the taste of the Chinese restaurant is also very good, the children of Jiaji Duck are also very happy to eat, and the pineapple fried rice in the Thai restaurant is also very popular.
Okay, on the last day, I walked to Baihua Valley for a stroll. I took a look at the price lists of various restaurants. I felt that it would be better to go back to the hotel to eat, safe and delicious, so I bought the seafood buffet for the second time~
The fly in the oin**ent may be that when the baby went to the toilet in the parent-child room, his leg was pinched by the toilet cover. Later, I observed that the toilet cover at home cannot be compacted, but the toilet cover of the hotel can be compacted. Risk of pinching legs. I asked for some iodophor, and the duty manager took a look, told the children to be careful next time, and left...
For a trip, there are always some episodes. Generally speaking, I still recommend Mangrove Forest. Before the epidemic, I stayed in other hotels in Sanya. There was no service at all. This time I stayed in Mangrove Forest for four days and three nights. I fell in love with Sanya again.

Satisfaction is no longer expanded, 5-star praise.
The catering service needs to be trained and improved, and the good places can learn from each other:
1. The Thai restaurant reminded in advance that an additional service fee would be charged for on-site ordering. The set menu dishes were randomly changed without telling the guests in advance. The waiters were indifferent to questions. What surprised the family most was the sentence "Ruby fish is white Pomfret"
2. The Chinese restaurant doesn‚Äôt seem to have warned in advance that an additional service fee is required for on-site ordering, but the service attitude is much more enthusiastic. Both times they took the initiative to introduce and recommend dishes, and my brother even ran to the kitchen to bring revolutionary vegetables and carob leaves Let me choose, my heart is warm.
3. The afternoon tea set in the lobby bar can be changed at will. There were no sandwiches twice, which is not unacceptable to me personally, but if I inform you in advance, it will make the guests feel completely different. I reminded the two times that there is still an ice cream missing. Guess if there are too many set meals here, the waiter can't figure it out.
Next time I come to the store, I hope the hotel can go further and bring a better experience.

msg:My son‚Äôs favorite hotel for this trip to Sanya has a private beach, a heated swimming pool, a large lawn, comfortable rooms, and a rich breakfast. The fly in the oin**ent is that the service level of the Chinese restaurant and the western restaurant needs to be trained in the evening. Although there are many service staff and not many customers, the speed of serving food is not flattering. All questions should be asked to the foreman, and they will not perform their duties. The Chinese food is delicious, and the price is OK. Also, I lost my beloved sunglasses in the outdoor children's area, which is also a pity, but next time we will choose to live in the mangrove forest!

The sanitation of the room is very sloppy and not clean. 4. Don't pay attention to customer satisfaction at all, and kick the ball when things happen. 5.

msg:This is my second self-driving trip to Hainan, and I also chose to live in Yalong Bay, but it was a very bad experience. Arrived at around 2:30 in the afternoon, checked in and said that the sanitation was still being done, and then the staff said that there was only the fourth floor, and there were no rooms on the 5th-6th floor, so I had to accept it. Then, after I got the room card at 4:00, this is room 2417. I booked a deluxe sea-view twin room. I opened the door and looked. Good guy, I didn‚Äôt see the sea at all, but I saw a row of coconut trees. I called the front desk to ask, and the front desk also said that it was the same as the picture on Ctrip. I said the same is the same, your tree has grown healthily and taller. It's kind of ********. I asked the staff to come up to understand the situation, but they didn't wait. I went down to the front desk to find a female manager to change the room. Later, I changed to the one on the picture. I don‚Äôt know what it is, as long as I can see the sea. This hotel is nothing but its location in the middle of Yalong Bay. The floor of the room is tiled and the facilities are very old. The elevator does not need to swipe the room card to enter without a sense of security. The management of the whole hotel is very relaxed. Tourists and passers-by can enter. I saw with my own eyes that families from other hotels came here to have afternoon tea and visit the hotel facilities and the beach. Finally, to sum up, this hotel is similar to an apartment-style seaside hotel. There is no five-star standard at all.

msg:I came here for Ctrip's parent-child hotel ranking and stayed for 3 nights.
5 points for the hotel's environment and location, the entrance landscape is beautiful, and the beach is just a few steps away, which fulfills our wish to lie on the beach and enjoy life;
Secondly, the basic facilities are satisfactory, you can fish, watch peacocks, there are free bath towels in the swimming pool, the balcony of the guest room is large, it is convenient to dry clothes, and you can also enjoy a good view. It‚Äôs just that the swimming ring actually costs money to rent, and it was free to use when staying at the Dadonghai Hotel before;
There are still many places to complain. First of all, it takes a long time to check in. On the first day, we told us that we would have to wait for an hour. Just as the baby was very sleepy, everyone was in a bad mood. In the end, my husband urged the front desk to speed up the check-in; and the room was a bit old Yes, I feel that it doesn‚Äôt match the price of more than 2,000 yuan per night; the last thing I want to complain about is the breakfast buffet, which is seriously unbalanced in nutrition, and there are too many types of carbohydrates. Basically, there is only one pork meat, and the rest are two or three types of processed meat such as sausages And luncheon meat, the coffee machine is actually only a small one, and it is hidden in a corner.
Overall, I still had a good time, but I still hope that the price, service and living experience of the hotel can match.

I like the Southeast Asian style of exterior design. It is transparent and rich in vegetation, like being in a forest. There is also a farm inside the hotel, with vegetable and fruit trees inside, and fishing is also very suitable for children to experience.
The swimming pool has sections suitable for children and adults, and the oversized lawn is very comfortable and open.
The hotel's private beach can be seen directly as soon as you enter the hotel lobby. The sand is fine and the sea is clear, and you can enjoy the sunrise and sunset.

Let me talk about the shortcomings: the faucet falls off when you lift it, and the shower rod loses control and often falls freely.

msg:Overall, I am satisfied.
The first is to upgrade the room type, the small suite with a bathtub on the 2nd floor, and you can still see a little sea view.
Secondly, the hotel is really close to the beach, each room type is very close to the beach, and the sea view from the lobby bar is really a must.
Finally, the services provided are still available, such as fishing, farms, children's playgrounds, deck chairs by the sea... basically there are entertainment facilities suitable for 3-year-old children, and there are many items provided in the rooms, such as bottle sterilizers, pillows, and children's footstools Wait.
The above are the advantages.
The following are the disadvantages.
There are a lot of charging items, really a lot.
1 There are many coin-operated items in the indoor children's playground;
2 Billiards and table tennis are charged, and it is not clear whether the gym charges or not;
3 The breakfast is very average, the cups and bowls are not cleaned, and the coffee is really poor;
4 The same dish in the same restaurant sells for 59 on the first day, and 89.9 after two days, and the price starts from the floor;
5. The service attitude is uneven. After a little urging, you will come over. The experience is very bad, but there are service staff with very good attitudes;
6 There are Chinese restaurants, Thai restaurants and Western restaurants in the restaurants, all of which require tips, and the Meituan group purchases do not charge service fees.

msg:The location is good, it is convenient to go to the beach, the greenery is okay, and the room is clean. The bathroom is big enough and the water is good.
There are a few issues, one is that check-in is slow and inconsistent. I booked the same room type, and those who came later were upgraded for free, but those who came first were not upgraded. I said I would call after cleaning, but I didn‚Äôt actually call. I had to ask myself. If I didn‚Äôt see the people coming into the room with their room cards, I wouldn‚Äôt have thought of urging them. I don‚Äôt know when I will have to wait. Another one, there are not many varieties of breakfast, the pasta is okay, other quality needs to be improved, it must match the hotel's positioning and price, do not use blended drinks, and do not use cheap "ham". In addition, the two swimming pools are very small, which can only be better than nothing. The weather in Sanya in January is very cold outdoors, it would be best if there is an indoor swimming pool. At the same time, it is hoped that there will be a children's paddling pool and an adult swimming pool. Otherwise, adults will take their children to take a bath, or there will be various screams, water guns, and fights. Normal adults can hardly enter the water.
Generally speaking, the services and facilities of Mangrove are not bad, but there are still many problems that need to be improved, and the needs of various types of guests need to be taken into account.

You can enter the water by pushing the door, and the heated swimming pool is not far away. It is said that there is no heated swimming pool in this season. , When it gets hot at noon, go directly to the sea. Yalong Bay has the cleanest beach in the mangrove forest. To be sure, there are still many people, too many people will be uncomfortable.

The facility is like a guest house, there is a maintenance for the elevator, and there is a queue for the other. There is basically no service, and there are no waiters waiting for luggage when checking in. Even after paying the room fee, a deposit of 500 per day is required. When there is no one in the lobby bar, you will be asked to spend money if you go to sit down. And it is required that check-out at 12 o'clock cannot be delayed. The most frightening thing is that the beach is full of mineral water bottle garbage, and the hotel doesn't help maintain it? Your selling point is the sea view!

msg:The check-in experience is very poor, the service is very bad, it is not recommended to book. 1. The room is very small, too small to fit an extra bed. When I checked in, I said that I would upgrade to a luxurious garden view for free. In fact, I took the small and slow elevator from the first floor to the third floor and lived in exactly the same room. The luxury here really opened my eyes.
2. The facilities are outdated and the project charges are high. Billiards, table tennis, and game consoles seem to have a lot of tricks, and they all have to be charged. I can only live in a small room for a room fee of more than 1,000.
3. Poor service with no sincerity. The room couldn‚Äôt add an extra bed, and the girl who checked in didn‚Äôt give me a solution, so she asked me to go to the check-out counter to find someone else; the waiter at the check-out counter told me that he didn‚Äôt know how to add an extra bed, so I had to ask the cleaning staff; Wait until after three in the afternoon from ten o'clock in the afternoon; I agreed to leave the store to pack breakfast, and my car arrived, and the front desk asked me how many breakfasts I ordered; the drinks in the lobby were gone at four or five in the afternoon...there are too many pitfalls to count.
4. The travel photography service is a routine of hotels and businesses. If you take hundreds of photos, you will be given five for each room, and an extra 30 yuan will be added. The hotel is giving away the guests to others.
In general, it hangs the signboard of a five-star hotel and provides services that are not as good as that of an express hotel. Whoever lives in it will be unlucky

The refund was postponed until the 14th on the 6th. I wondered if the hotel had to inform the guests in advance of the deposit, and the refund was returned the same way. Why did it take so long? You deduct the money without notifying the guests. If you don't pay attention to what you are doing, I think the hotel's approach is quite problematic.

msg:The price/performance ratio is very high. The price is really exciting, but in terms of hotel facilities and services, it is really not very good in Yalong Bay. The room looks old but clean. The landscapes of different rooms of the same room type are actually quite different. The room I changed on the second day was much better than the one I checked in on the first day. The sound insulation of the room is not good. People talking and walking in the corridor can clearly hear the noise of the refrigerator. People who sleep lightly choose carefully. The hotel garden is well maintained, it looks beautiful from the room, and the swimming pool is also very clean. At this price, it is completely acceptable. The hotel's children's facilities are very good. The children had a great time, especially the slides. The service attitude of all the staff in the hotel is very good, just average.

Service: At the beginning, I asked if I could upgrade the room and I was told that I couldn‚Äôt. When I arrived at the room, the sea view room arranged was super far from the sea. We asked again whether there was a real sea view room instead of the sea view that needed to be seen. This time it was changed. Seaside room. It would have been better if we had been placed in a better position from the beginning, and the back and forth waiting took some time. Anyway, it was replaced with a real sea view room, and I am still satisfied.

After being bitten by mosquitoes, the hotel service staff helped to find the medicine box. They were very enthusiastic and sincere. I was really moved here. When we left, the service staff gave ethnic necklaces, which were very in line with the Southeast Asian style and made me feel very happy.

However, the restaurant service needs to be strengthened. When eating coconut chicken, the rice cooker was broken for a long time and no one noticed, and the seasoning was empty for a long time without adding.

All in all, this comfortable stay made me believe that I will come back again. Mangrove is by far the most satisfying hotel I have ever stayed in.

The hotel has its own private beach. You can lie on the loungers and watch the sea. Don't be too comfortable, and enjoy a leisurely vacation. The breakfast variety is not much, but the taste is very good. The service is also very good. I changed to Atlantis in the next two days, and I still miss the resort style of mangroves. The only thing that makes me feel uncomfortable is that I need a 100 deposit to borrow an umbrella at the concierge desk. They are all hotel guests. Shouldn't it be OK to register the room number? There is also a suggestion that it is better to replace the toiletries with disposable ones at nine o'clock, which is more clean and hygienic!

The hotel's first-line seafood buffet is average, so it's better to go outside and order seafood yourself. 3. Takeaway can only be delivered to the entrance of the parking lot. It is not convenient for guests to pick up meals. Now they order takeaway. Don't use this method to bother the people who stay, it is unnecessary.

I really hope that the hotel can manage and maintain it well. The food is richer than ours in Haitang Bay, but the quality is average. Many things that are not delicious are wasted. It is possible to appropriately reduce unnecessary supply and improve quality than quantity. Coffee machine Too little, it's not good to drink, very water, the restaurant service is just so-so, not the overall problem The experience brought üëçüèø

msg:The second time I stayed at Yalong Bay Mangrove Resort Hotel üè® The quality is still OK... There are more people in the summer, and the check-in is relatively slow. But the attitude of the staff is really good and patiently answering every question... This time they also gave me a small upgrade for free, which is very good! The hotel's breakfast has not changed from the previous one. The only thing missing is that the coffee is not freshly ground by the coffee machine. Fruits were also delivered when checking out... In short, it is the second time to stay and it is worth choosing!

msg:Let‚Äôs talk about the conclusion first. We went there after the price increase began in July. Compared with other hotel rooms, we can only say that it is average. The facilities are relatively old, the room is small, there is no disposable razor, the disposable items in the hotel are like those of an express hotel, and the parent-child activities in the hotel are not interested. Surprisingly, the children especially like the house with the swimming pool on the first floor. It is very convenient to swim, but unfortunately it is connected with the public swimming pool, and the privacy is not good enough.

msg:I can probably count as the first wave of Shanghai tourists rushing out of the "blockade" üòÅ. Because of the price, I did not choose the peak period flight, and the experience at the airport is normal. Living in Yalong Bay, I deeply experienced the lack of training for new recruits. However, as the experience of being closed in February, banning dine-in in January, and the impact of the closure of Sanya in mid-January due to the epidemic, there is a feeling of being connected with fate. Therefore, on the one hand, it is understood, and on the other hand, it is proposed to the hotel management. The problems encountered were basically solved. For example, the breakfast salad has no oil and vinegar, and the chef made one for me on the spot. The placement of the TV in the room affects the view of the sea-view room, and they also sent engineering personnel to dismantle it. The mangrove forest is a very typical Southeast Asian design style, and the lighting design is natural, which fits well with the quiet and quiet natural environment. Compared with the Tianyu Kindergarten Hotel next door, which is suitable for young children, the whole beach is full of "bear children". Bears can only endure their own for at most 10 minutesü•≤. On the other side, Meigao seems to be more suitable for young people. At night, it has the feeling of a nightclub, very high and high-pitched. Fifteen years ago, Mangrove was also a very popular hotel. In particular, they have a Thai restaurant, which needs to be booked before travel. This time, I drank the same bowl of Tom Yum Goong again, which was very satisfying. In short, the experience in the mangroves is in line with the feeling that I want to be in a quiet daze by the sea, and it is very pleasant. Have a good dinner in the central square, walk back along the beach, there is a beautiful sunset every day. How can I feel uncomfortable. p.s. The beach from Tianyu to Mangrove and then to Meigao is very delicate. The further west you go, the sand will be slightly thicker. I can‚Äôt remember which one is the thickest.
In addition, follow-up tourists should be reminded to be careful about stepping on thunder at the farmers' market, because they had a good time and people were very relaxed. They decided to go to the fruit market temporarily without reading the guide. I met an enthusiastic boss at Honggang Fruit Market, and let you try all kinds of fruits for free first. Delicious is really delicious. Thinking of allowing relatives, friends and colleagues to have a taste, I bought thousands of pieces of fruit. As a result, the delivery was delayed, and I stayed at the airport for one night, and also sent it to Hangzhou, a place that is hotter than Shanghai. After waiting for another day, it was already terrible to see in Shanghai. The big mangosteen fruit was obviously replaced by a small fruit that could be eaten for free. I have to accept the fact that they are stealing. Later, when I checked the public comment, I was not the first to step on the thunder. Eating too high, relax your vigilance. Buy a lesson. It also reminded me to come back and work hard. This lesson is worth more than mistakes at work. If the relevant depar**ents can strengthen the management of this aspect, it will greatly improve the overall image of Sanya. It is not enough to choose Southeast Asian island tours when the country is open. If the country comes, more people may still choose to travel abroad. At least the money is well spent. I still like Sanya very much and will go again, just to be more vigilant. Overall this trip means a lot to me, and I get the best relaxation in mind and body. As for unscrupulous merchants, I believe that good and evil will eventually pay off!
The video of the swimming pool below was taken on the morning before I left. Because it was raining, I was enjoying the sea view in the wind and rain on the balcony. I accidentally found a handsome guy swimming in the rain. I also want to experience the feeling of swimming in the rain. The video was left to the lobby manager, who wondered if he could find this handsome guy who loves swimming. Hoping to see this comment, took the video as a small gift. Next time I have to experience it! The full video is five minutes long, just for a tour. If you need to find me, or Annie Wang, the lobby manager.

msg:The first-line hotel in Yalong Bay has an excellent location and is very close to the commercial street. You can enjoy the beach and the sea every day. The swimming pool has a rotating water slide which is quite exciting. The sea view room is great, the bathroom is very large, but it is not convenient to have only one washbasin. There is a small supermarket on the first floor of the hotel to buy fruits and snacks. The price of food delivery is also very reasonable. It's just that there are too many people for breakfast, and the quality is average, which does not match the price. There is a small episode in the reservation, thanks to Ctrip's customer service bubble for helping to solve it smoothly.

It takes a long time for people to run away and disappear for a long time. Tell you when your patience is running low, the guest room will not be available until after 3 o'clock. The reason is that there are fewer people booked in the room type you set. So you want to express that you don't clean the room that no one has booked after the previous guest leaves the hotel? I just ran to the beach to kill time. When I got to 3:00 to check 5:00, the waiter told me that because the room was still being cleaned, I would have to wait for another 40 minutes. I must have lost hair, and then the front desk kept saying that it was them Ministry), not hers. This quality... Even if your hotel is cheaper than Atlantis, you still have a five-star rating. The most basic service quality is up to standard, right? ? It was easy to check in, and the balcony landscape was a little comforting. The outside scenery is really good, and it is really impossible to ignore this factor. The hotel's Thai restaurant tastes good, which is surprising. Don't have any ideas about breakfast and fill your stomach.

msg:Stayed two years ago and thought it was a good resort hotel. This stay, can not say bad, but the experience is not good. From the beginning of the check-in, during the off-peak period, it took 20 minutes for the person in front of me to check in, and no one came to greet us to rest or check in at other counters during the non-peak period, because it felt that everyone was busy and didn't know what to do. The guests were all busy. No. Entering the room, the overall feeling is much older, all of which are hotels with the lowest hardware ranking in Yalong Bay. The beach is still one of the best in Yalong Bay, and the water quality is clearer than that of MGM, but the service can't keep up. Take a towel and answer me no, and tell me to wait for half an hour. Breakfast was decent, but half of it was outside and it was a little hot. Final summary: If you want a good beach, you can choose, but after all, this is still a thousand-dollar hotel, and you need a better experience, such as better hardware and a little service, I will pay a few hundred more to the MGM, Or add a little more to Marriott to Hilton to Ritz. Mangrove I will not come again! Can come alone for Thai food, the only thing that's ok!

Poor service The front desk recommends to buy the 128 breakfast, which is completely in accordance with the ten yuan standard. There is nothing to eat, I don't know if there are too many people.

The hotel provides free self-testing and inspection kits for self-reporting. There is also "two inspections in three days", I am really relieved, and the prevention and control work is in place~

I came to Yalong Bay in Sanya 10 years ago and was deeply impressed by the beauty here. Because I was not sure whether the epidemic would require 14-day quarantine trea**ent, I chose a relatively mature and cost-effective mangrove forest in Yalong Bay, which is connected to an exclusive beach.

It is necessary to praise the famous Thai restaurant on the island. In this hotel, according to the service brother Michael, other Thai restaurants in other hotels have to come here to exchange and learn üòèü•∞üòÜ, full of pride and pride! Tried Tom Yum Kung Soup... It really deserves this little pride ü¶ö The eggplant pot is also very northern! Haha, for 2 days in a row, many hotel restaurants have been closed due to the epidemic, and the prices in the shopping plaza outside are not low. I didn‚Äôt expect that dining in the hotel would be the best choice! 200+ sets for 2 people is still very touching. Under the epidemic, big hotels are struggling to support, and there is no price increase [strong][strong][strong][strong].

I started my trip to Sanya with the "Island Master" pose. [Han laugh] [Hold a fist] [Smiley] I have always been a "business traveler", and I was also loved by a little cute~ There are some exclusive arrangements for parents and children, warm and childish ÔΩ° Moreover, the corners of the table and cabinet are all protected by silicone soft shells, which are full of small details.

I need to work in isolation, so facing the sea and spring flowers are already an excellent office environment... After taking a bath, you can continue to work in front of the sea! [smiling] [leisurely] [smiling]

The hotel's facilities are well maintained, although the southern humidity is inevitable, but the mattresses are very comfortable. Usually, the air conditioner and fan should not open the balcony door as much as possible to keep it relatively dry. And welcome fruit~
It's a comfortable hotel~

There are small surprises in the room layout and fruit, although the facilities are a little old, the design is very user-friendly everywhere. In the morning, you can stroll around the hotel for a long time, and Scarecrow Farm is very suitable for families with children. The beach has not been affected by the maintenance, and the beach outside the mangroves is the only one that is guarded 24 hours a day. When we went for a lap at night, there were people on duty and patrolling. During the epidemic, there were very few people on the beach. Be responsible for. The service attitude of the reception desk Ann and the switchboard is also very good, and I will choose to stay next time I come.

msg:Travel in early March. The package deluxe sea view double room with double breakfast booked half a month in advance costs 1200‚ûï per unit, but the price dropped when I stayed a few days ago. Arrived and upgraded to deluxe sea view junior suite. Talk about the pros and cons of the experience.
advantage:
1. Location: Yalong Bay, this row of hotels facing the sea The mangrove forest is relatively affordable. The location is really good. Downstairs is the lawn beach. There are few people and the sand is fine. Of course, it is easy to get sunburned. You can also walk to other hotels to take pictures and punch cards (the MGM facility next door is more Internet celebrity)
2. Room facilities: The small suite has a good view, and the balcony faces the sea, looking at the military port and warships in the distance, as well as the nearby marine entertainment projects, which are full of holiday winds. I think the bathtub and bathroom facilities are good. Before I came here, many reviews said that the facilities were old and the bathtub was black. But I didn't come across the pictures. I take a dip every day and it's very comfortable. The bedding is also comfortable, but not very high-end, and the mattress is soft. There are many channels to watch on TV, especially international channels (CNN RT, etc.).
3. Hotel facilities: outdoor swimming pool is OK, swimming ring rental is 20 per hour. But the big slide is only open to children. There is also a scarecrow farm behind the hotel and a simulated shooting experience venue, which is suitable for parents and children with children and the elderly. Coupled with the palm lawn, young people can swim and take pictures.

shortcoming:
1. Service: I can't say it's bad, I can only say it's normal. I didn't contact the guest in advance to ask the customer's needs and whether they could pick up the airport (I didn't use the pick-up because I drove by myself, but the package includes pick-up), which is better than the Westin Shimei Bay, Wanning, where I lived at the same time. The gap is huge. When I checked out, I said that it was a little late, although I agreed, but the explanation seemed to give me a great favor and I was not comfortable. The hotel security guards are always watching the tourists flying the drone, and they are ordered to descend when they fly together. Very ********. (Of course, because Yalong Bay is close to the naval base, there is indeed a sign that no flying is standing, but DJI is very detailed, and the hotel does not prohibit it here.
Breakfast: Open until 10:30. Many dishes are no longer available after 10:00. Although the individually made Baoluofen noodles are not bad, the overall richness does not make me feel that it matches the hotel segment. There are many types of carbs, but not many have good taste. And some dishes are not served every day and remain consistent.

Overall, I think Ctrip's rating is relatively objective. But if I had to choose again I would be more inclined to experience the other homes in the row.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. It faces the sea and is close to the beach. There are many restaurants in Baihuagu Food Street 200 meters to the east. There is an ecological garden in the hotel for fishing, and there is a go-kart next to it. It is very cheap. The warm water on the left and right is very intimate and suitable for babies to play, and the large swimming pool has a flushing slide. The water bar in the center of the first floor of the hotel is very nice and suitable for a rest. The only disappoin**ent is that the location of the room here is not very good. It may be that the hotels I stayed in before were all ‚â•180 degrees of sea view. This time, the feeling of staying here is wrapped, a little oppressive, and pitiful in the building. Only the sea can be seen in the 30-degree field of view. The annex below is attached with the hotel room distribution map. Please confirm the location with the front desk when you stay. The hotel service has to be said to be very good. The waiter who cleans the room comes every day to check if there is anything else to thank her. The manager also thoughtfully arranges for someone to deliver fruit every day. Thank you very much. There is a gate at the main entrance of the hotel, and takeaways can only be delivered to the main entrance. You need to walk down from Datang, which is about 100 meters away. It would be perfect if you can set up a convenient place next to Datang for guests to pick up. The fineness of the beach is good, and there are beds in the hotel to rest. Water sports are not expensive next to it, and you can dig sixties in the beach.

In fact, the deluxe sea view room we chose can also look at the sea from the side, not directly opposite. Because I want to choose sunshine so that it won't get wet on rainy days, net red Thai lemongrass water, this taste is acceptable and sweet
Breakfast until 10:30. It is quite rich, and there are many entertainment activities for children. If you must choose Yalong Bay, this hotel is less children than Tianyu Hotel haha

It's too close to the lobby bar downstairs, it's a bit noisy, and friends who sleep lightly and need a lunch break at noon should pay attention to room selection. Check in coincides with the birthday, the hotel sent a small cake. There is Scarecrow Farm. The service attitude of the bartender in the lobby bar in charge of bartending is very good and enthusiastic. Concierge and room service are good. There is a small heated swimming pool. There is an elder sister in the constant temperature swimming pool who carefully checks the room card and supervises the guests to wash the sand before entering the swimming pool when they return from the beach. The hotel is generally good. Check out fast.

There are several main reasons: 1. The hotel environment is very beautiful! The staff of the hotel are all kind, attentive, and even understand you! grateful!
2. The manor hotel is very primitive and dense. The daughter of the farm likes it the most. There is no charge for feeding small animals to eat vegetables and mangroves!!! Vegetable leaves, fish food, enough!!!
3. The best thing is that the heated swimming pool is huge! open air! temperature in winter
It is the most comfortable temperature swimming pool! (You have to believe me)
4. The key point!!! The swimming pool is equipped with cute coaches who can teach swimming to adults and children. I also know that I can ask a coach to teach my daughter how to swim, so I decided to continue the room haha üòÉ!
The green clothes in the video are the coach "Feng Peng" who is very good at taking children
Playing middle school, doing that kind of middle school, my daughter is very relaxed and happy to follow
And the charge is conscientious ah 150/hour. In the five-star hotel I inquired about, this price is impossible for other hotels to teach.

Although my daughter has only had 4 sessions, she has already mastered all the standard movements
Very accomplished!

grateful! ! I wish you here a wonderful experience like mine! Bless you who is coming

Hardware can be said to be an old hotel, and it is difficult to upgrade and update, but can't soft power keep pace with the times? I have a background in hotel management, and I have never seen a hotel with such poor service. The front desk/concierge asked three questions, the Chinese restaurant missed the order, the food was served very slowly, and the taste was unpalatable. Giving interns a chance to practice is good, but not at the expense of customer experience and efficiency! The whole hotel did not feel the warmth of the hotel staff and the warmth that makes customers feel at home.

In short, Mangrove Hotel, will never stay again in the future.

In addition to swimming, children love to dig sand at the beach, and digging is not enough all day long. Looking south from the hotel lobby bar, a huge pool extends out to the sea, like a mirror of the sky, which is the most thoughtful design of the hotel. Between the hotel and the beach is a huge lawn, under the sunlight, a large area of pleasant green. The sea breeze, sunshine and beach are the first choice for winter vacation in Sanya. In the early morning, I woke up from the chirping of birds in the woods, sitting on the balcony sipping coffee, a hotel guest was practicing the violin, the melodious sound of the piano floated over, a beautiful day.

Although the Southeast Asian resort-style rooms are a bit outdated for more than ten years, they are still my favorite. I still like the style very much. This summer vacation is very full. This is the 2nd-3rd night of my renewal. The lobby manager is very good to upgrade me from a deluxe sea view room to a sea view junior suite, room 1531 facing the sea. , The room is very positive, and the landscape view is also very good. I like the service of the hotel. Thank you for giving the babies a very pleasant 3-night experience.

The only disadvantage is that the clothes drying racks are too low. There are 2 swimming pools, 2 swimming pools are too few for this hotel. The service staff is very enthusiastic, every time I get on and off the bus, they help to open the door and take luggage.

After many years of operation, the hotel plants are lush and lush, and the service system is also very mature.
The original garden view room was temporarily upgraded to a room with a side view of the sea when we checked in. The interior of the room, although a little dated, is well maintained and easy to use.
The day before check-in, the housekeeper Bella contacted me to ask about room preferences, check-in time, and help coordinate room upgrades. This price hotel also has a butler, which is a bit surprising. When checking in, the butler greets you warmly and introduces the hotel facilities. Inquire about comfort at appropriate times during your stay. There is a feeling of coming home.
The beach is very beautiful in the morning and evening, walk on the beach and look for crabs. There are several beds under the coconut trees, and I felt very good after lying down for a while.
The hotel sent a travel photo, took more than 30 photos, and you can choose five for free. Because the photographer Ah Liang did a great job. . . I couldn't help but pay for twenty more. . . Although I knew before the photo that this might be a consumer item, I couldn't help but pay when I saw the photo hahaha.
Next time I come back to Sanya, I hope to stay here. Comfortable, affordable and cost-effective.

After making the reservation, I received a call from the hotel's housekeeper, Bella, who carefully asked about the situation and requirements of the accompanying staff, patiently answered various questions, and also specifically asked if there were children accompanying me~ I knew that I had brought children, so I arranged the children's fence and children's toiletries in advance, which was very considerate. . After arriving at the hotel on the day of check-in, Bella made a special trip to receive and check in, and even prepared a beautiful tropical garland collar for the children. The cordial greetings give people a very warm feeling. This time, I stayed in the super flying man room and super suite, which can see the first-class sea view. The hotel has a direct access to the beach, and there are many parent-child activities to participate in, such as children's fishing, outdoor children's playground, bubble battle, children's fishing, driving an electric car, shooting games, feeding small animals, all of which have been experienced, and the daily activities are very arranged. Rich. Because the hotel asked for hot food for the children, the hotel even sent a microwave oven, which is very friendly to families with children. The most humane thing is that there is a heated swimming pool, and children will no longer worry about catching a cold when swimming. Because I only stayed for two days, I didn't go to the indoor children's park, but it is good to leave some regrets. Next time, I will choose Yalong Bay Mangrove Forest, and I will choose the housekeeper Bella. Super perfect experience, like üëç

msg:During this New Year‚Äôs holiday trip to Sanya, I stayed in the Yalong Bay Mangrove for one night, and the garden-view room for more than 800 nights was very cost-effective. As soon as you enter the hotel, you are attracted by the pool, lawn, coconut trees and the distant sea view in the atrium, with a wide view and bright light. The hotel can walk directly to the beach. After breakfast in the morning and before going to bed in the evening, you can go for a walk on the beach. There is a feeling of enjoying a private beach. The sand on the beach of Yalong Bay is relatively fine, and the sea is very clear. Playing on the beach, playing in the sand, lying down and reading a book are all excellent.

Had breakfast and dinner respectively in the western restaurant and Thai restaurant in the hotel, and the dishes tasted good. Thai food is delicious and cost-effective. In addition, there are entertainment facilities for parents and children in the hotel, and there are more guests walking with their babies when walking in the evening. Generally speaking, the Yalong Bay mangrove forest is suitable for family one-stop vacation and entertainment. It is more convenient in all aspects. It is worthwhile to continue to consider staying in the hotel when you come to Yalong Bay next time.

In addition, I would also like to thank Peng Qian, the lobby manager, who helped me solve the problems related to beach travel photography. I am very concerned about the guest experience and I like it.

If you don't mind the obsolescence of the room, you can bring your parents to live. The average price is acceptable within 500-600. Don't come if the price is more than this, especially not cost-effective.

msg:The hotel is very poor and does not meet the standards of a five-star hotel. The room is the same as a county-level guest house where I went to Guanshan Ranch one year. The picture of the room is attached. The only advantage of living here is that it is close to the sea, but compared to nearby hotels. It looks terrible. First of all, in terms of the quality of the staff, my family and I came from Sheraton and wanted to change to Tianyu. Because of the heavy rain, we said to go in and hide from the rain. By the way, look at the environment and check the house price. It was the lowest in this piece (there was a reason why we wanted to be low later). We booked it on Ctrip. We paid the deposit for the room fee. At the front desk, a male waiter asked us to pay the room fee and also paid a deposit of 1,000 yuan. I asked why, what basis do I need to submit, and everyone looks at his room, it‚Äôs not as good as the configuration of a county-level guest house, the room is only a few dozen dollars and a hair dryer, and later because of a dispute, a woman came over and said that she didn‚Äôt need a deposit. NS.
        The second is that my mobile phone ran out of power when I was at the front desk. Later, I was in a bad mood and I forgot to leave it at the front desk. When I arrived at the room, I found that I didn‚Äôt see my mobile phone. My husband said you go to the front desk to find it. There was no one at the front desk where I checked in during working hours. I had to ask the security guard in the lobby if he saw a mobile phone. The security went to the front desk to find out and said no, I said, check the monitoring. There must be monitoring at the front desk. If you are not allowed to check, you will call the police to check. The security guard went to the back room and took out my mobile phone and asked if it was yours. The miraculous thing is that my mobile phone is turned on and the screen is on, but it is locked. Screen secret code, so it‚Äôs not turned on

msg:Overall impression: It can be said that it is the most cost-effective hotel in Yalong Bay

Room facilities: Since it is a hotel that has been in operation for many years, it is undeniable that the facilities are indeed a bit old. For example, the tiled floor of the room, the more "original" air conditioning system, etc. But the room maintenance and original facilities are still very kind. Sea view room with a view on both sides of the corridor on one side and a balcony with sea view. The bathroom has a spacious countertop and a bathtub. Basically, the age of the room does not affect the living experience except that it is not easy to take good-looking photos.

Location and beach: This should be the most commendable point of the mangrove forest. First of all, it can directly lead to the beach, and it is separated from the Yalong Bay commercial district by Tianyu Hotel. It is more convenient whether it is going to the beach or shopping and eating. There will be no crowds in public areas on the beach, and the hotel also provides a towel loan service.

Swimming pool and garden: The swimming pool provides a special-shaped main pool and a circular swimming pool. Because it is outdoors, although the cleaning frequency is high, there is still an inevitable chance of encountering fallen leaves; deck chairs and awnings are adequately set up, and there are also water slides for children to play ( But opening hours are limited). The hotel has a very "luxury" green landscape for strolling in both the public area and behind the guest rooms.

Restaurant and shopping: The hotel‚Äôs Thai restaurant has always been very popular in Yalong Bay, and the actual dining experience is also relatively satisfactory. However, it is a little regrettable that the seaside cafeteria closed during the epidemic. The breakfast was served for a long time but the open stalls were limited, and no ice cubes were found. However, the experience of outdoor dining with sea views is very unique. The hotel has a small number of boutiques and a sea view lobby bar, but it is not equipped with night snacks, and the hotel supermarket is relatively simple, and may be improved.

Service: The hotel service has maintained a level that exceeds its price point. Check-in and cleaning are very meticulous (even helped to organize our messy electronic equipment, thank you very much), and the staff is fully staffed everywhere. However, the service guidance of breakfast and Thai restaurant was a bit confusing, and it was too long for check-in because of too many guests.

In general, although the Yalong Bay mangrove forest has small problems such as aging facilities and a slight gap between services and standard hotels, its excellent location and hardware and software facilities make it a cost-effective choice for Yalong Bay.

msg:Let me talk about the highlights:
1. For the travel shots booked in the hotel, the photographer Xiao Rui, who loves to shoot every day, is enthusiastic and patient, and is worth recommending. It was originally a set package, and finally the negatives were directly packaged and purchased, and a set-up was also given.
2. The hotel environment is good, beautiful, the beach is very beautiful, facilities are complete, and there are also farms, especially the swimming pool is especially suitable for taking children to play, the waiter will provide hot bath towels in time after swimming, the details of the service are worthy of praise, but swimming The circle has to be charged separately, 20 per person per hour.
3. The welcoming staff takes the initiative to carry luggage and has a enthusiastic attitude.
Make complaints:
1: The quality of service in the Chinese restaurant is very poor. After waiting for half an hour after ordering, the waiter came and said that the delivery of the food was unsuccessful and asked to order again. I was very hungry after waiting for a long time, so I wanted to eat noodles casually and asked the waiter to recommend a few dishes. The waiter was completely unfamiliar with his own dishes, so I had to ask the chef for each dish.
2: The dishes are hard to say, expensive and unpalatable.
3: There are 298 people on the beachside barbecue, but there are very few types. For example, there are salmon on the brochure, but in fact only oysters, crabs and other types of fish can be eaten. If you want to eat seafood, you can only go outside the hotel or Eat in the city. There is also a self-service beer, which is really awful. But the singer is still very good to sing.
4: I ordered a deluxe sea view room, but only the park can be seen. I called the front desk to ask. The front desk said that as long as you can see the sea from the balcony from 10 to 15 angles, they are called sea view rooms! What is the logic? ?
5: The voltage in the toilet of the hotel can't use the hair dryer, and the hair can only be blown outside. The hair is blown on the ground in the bedroom. The front desk told every room to be like this.
6: The cleaning attendant puts the hair dryer in a different position every day. It is placed in the drawer of the bedside table today and in the other drawer tomorrow, which leads me to think that I have lost the hair dryer.

In short: Don't report too high expectations. If you go to see the sea and experience the environment, it is still possible, but if you want to enjoy the service, let's forget it.

The staff at the front desk are very cold, indifferent, and feel mediocre. On the contrary, the aunts who clean the rooms, the younger brothers by the pool and the restaurant are very polite and kind.

I hope that the speed can be a little faster when checking in, and the door lock can check the battery regularly. This time I encountered the battery problem of the door lock, and the staff quickly solved it, but it would be better to avoid this problem in time with regular inspections.

It's been here for thirteen years. I never thought I would have such a long love for a hotel. The mangrove forest is suitable for leisure and vacation. Take a swim in the sea and then go back to the pool for a splash. The hotel is not noisy, and it is quiet and quiet, especially for rest and relaxation. Although it is in Yalong Bay with many big-name hotels, the beach in front of the mangrove forest is undoubtedly one of the best, very soft and clean. Now I have already given up the breakfast in the hotel when I come to Mangrove. One is that the number of days I stayed is more, and the other is that the breakfast is really not delicious. You can eat for one day, stay for four or five days, and you can‚Äôt take it every day. Fortunately, Yalong Bay‚Äôs commerce is becoming more and more mature. Haidilao, McDonald‚Äôs, KFC, Tanyu, Tanlu, Ajisen Ramen, Starbucks, Pizza Hut and other big restaurant chains can be found in Baihuagu Commercial Street or Binhai Plaza. The hotel used to It only takes about ten minutes to take away. The Thai restaurant did not consume this time, and I don't know how the standard is maintained. I hope it tastes as good as ever. One of the biggest feelings during this visit is that the service staff in all aspects have increased their service awareness, and it is really a bonus to take the initiative to say hello! There is also the manager Xiao Zhao in the lobby. The service is considerate and he gave an upgrade surprise before the festival. Thank you very much!

Because I did not check in the day before, Bella at the front desk of the hotel directly applied to help me upgrade the room.

Thank you very much for the hotel‚Äôs humanity and Bella‚Äôs thoughtful service. The hotel staff felt very good for the hotel staff during the few days of staying. The rooms were cleaned every day. The hotel time should be quite long, the decoration is a bit old, but the advantage is that the room is big enough, and the first-line ocean view hotel is relatively quiet and not so noisy. It is suitable for mothers who want to quietly bring a baby. Next time you come to Sanya I think I will choose to stay in the mangroves.

Inside the room, the large bottles of toiletries, and the fully tiled floor, I saw it for the first time in a five-star hotel. There is a shower on the balcony. I really don‚Äôt understand what it can do. The door reaches my shoulder and there is no curtain. Is the shower a personal display? I am a little over 1.7 meters tall and can only stand indoors in the bathtub to take a shower. The breakfast line is waiting for the location, the taste of Chinese and Western food is average, and the drinks and fruits taste good. What beach tools + fishing + travel shooting mentioned in the order? In short, no one gave me any hints in this series. I only had breakfast. There is no guideline for children to participate in the project. You need to ask yourself. If you don‚Äôt ask, no one will help you. The good convenience is that the scenery is good, the hotel has a Southeast Asian style, the interior of the hotel is like a big park, the beach is clean, the green surrounding the swimming pool is very good, the swimming pool is not sun-dried, the children's playground is quite big, and the children are very happy to play.

The dozens of tall and tidy big king palm trees are refreshing and beautiful, and the oversized green lawn still feels the same. Two swimming pools, one square, one surrounds the green island, children's favorite. This trip was a transition from Atlantis, and the children kept asking, is this the last time we have come to the mangrove forest? I said, if you want to come, you can do it every year. The hotel is very close to the beach, and the sandy beach of Yalong Bay is thinner than that of Haitang Bay, the sea is clearer, and the waves are small. It is very suitable for swimming in the water. It is worthy of being the site of an old five-star hotel. However, the emerging hotels in Haitang Bay continue to rise, and if they want to take a place in Sanya's tourism industry, the mangrove forests must be new regularly.

All the staff are enthusiastic and efficient, like it! There are mosquitoes outdoors, so be sure to protect them!

msg:The queue time was very long when we checked in at the hotel. We got tired after getting off the plane and taking the car to the hotel that day! As a result, I had queued up at the front desk to check in for so long. The children were tired and noisy. I went up and asked why it was so slow. The staff answered blankly, then you can go to the side and line up, and you can check in. of. It is very uncomfortable. . I have been queuing for so long, so if I change the side, don‚Äôt I have to re-row again? Too perfunctory! The first time I stayed in a five-star hotel and encountered such a slow check-in situation! The hotel room is not bad, without the old feeling mentioned in the comments. The beach is very close to the guest room, just a few steps downstairs. There are also water projects to experience. I chose this parent-child hotel because I was bringing children. However, there was no staff member telling me how to participate in the hotel‚Äôs children‚Äôs entertainment program. I checked it out on the Internet and then asked the staff myself. Many items are charged separately! The swimming ring in the swimming pool is also charged by the hour! There are so many people for breakfast! That‚Äôs how the dishes are! Anyway, staying in the hotel is the same, the food will not be too good! The Thai restaurant in the hotel is not as delicious as the reviews said! It's expensive! The portion is not enough! The key taste is really average! We bought a package at our own expense for a trip on the beach, and the photos were pretty good for the children. I took them with a wide-angle lens for adults. All the faces were deformed. Although the photos were sent to me, the photos of the adults were particularly ugly! I can‚Äôt choose any good-looking ones. The kid‚Äôs shot was taken by another photographer. It‚Äôs okay. And we chose the 699 package. . Later, I went to Haitang Bay for two days, and the travel shot there was only 399 yuan! Everyone, please don't do nothing like us. Spending wrong money. Overall, the stay experience is okay! After all, it‚Äôs mainly to see the sea!

The hotel upgrades room types for free, presents fruits, small gifts, and arranges VIP seats for breakfast. The front desk manager Bella comes to inquire about the check-in experience every day, if you need help, feel at home. The door of the hotel is being painted at night, and it should look new after a while. There are many supporting facilities such as karting, shooting range, children's playground, etc., but because the weather is too hot, it is not suitable for outdoor activities during the day, and it is too late to experience it after staying for four days.

The waves on Yalong Bay are bigger than Sanya Bay. In addition to the shuttle bus to the duty-free shop, the hotel also has a shuttle bus to the mangrove hotels in other districts.

Hotel facilities: There are beautiful swimming pools, lawns, beaches, farms, and a children's playground on the first floor. There are so many places that children like üëç

Hotel environment: the greening is very good, the old banyan tree, the tall coconut tree...The first day I checked in, I met Mr. Gecko under the tree by the lawn^_^

Hotel services: The waiters are very polite, and they will take the initiative to say hello "hello" when they meet in the corridor, especially Ena at the front desk, a beautiful girl, very friendly and caring, and he helped to check out and gave the hotel a souvenir Kids, thank you ^_^

The 270-degree ocean view suite experience is superb. Although the children's pool is not big, the children enjoy it. The hotel has a good parent-child experience and is very suitable for children. When leaving the store, the process is very fast and the service is very good. The housekeeper Ena Yang also gave the children a bunch of souvenirs. I will choose here next time.

The swimming pool in the hotel is very beautiful, and the service of Ina at the front desk is also very good. The lawn of the hotel can be used as an endless feeling, providing a great outdoor party venue like a green carpet. The sea is in the distance. There is a pool in the atrium that can be connected to the sea. There are tall coconut trees on both sides, and there are large areas for children to play. The small train in the facility park runs around the park. Children sit on it and sing and laugh all the way. People are playing in the swimming pool. The pool water is not deep, but it is very large. There is also a diving practice pool. Booster, the buffet in the morning is also rich and delicious. Enjoy the beautiful scenery of the sea and the sky. It is right to choose the Yalong Bay Mangrove Forest, and there are free shuttle buses between the Mangrove Sanya Bay Branch and the Yalong Bay Branch Haitang Bay Branch.

In the evening, there will be a little more people. I stayed for four nights and booked a garden-view room. I got there very late that day, and I was a little embarrassed to see the room. Qu, I can only see coconut trees. I got a sea view suite three nights later the next day. It was too comfortable. It was facing the sea and the big lawn downstairs. It was very cool, but the floor was a little bit shorter, the only thing I stayed in a few days The downside may be that the decoration of the room is indeed old. After all, it is old and acceptable. The main scenery is beautiful. The breakfast is average. There are not many types. The overall stay is quite satisfactory. My mother is not willing to come back.

For people with babies, this hotel is very friendly. From the playground equipment to the small bedding and toiletries, it is very suitable for babies.
The swimming pool is partially covered and there is a constant temperature swimming pool. We went there in June and it was very hot and we had a great time in the outdoor swimming pool. The baby is not tanned at all (it is best to bring a long-sleeved swimsuit to play during the day, not afraid of getting suntan)
üëçMost recommended:
What I like most about the hotel is its cleanliness and no mosquitoes. The semi-open hotel does not know how to be mosquito-free.
The elder sisters in the room service depar**ent are very enthusiastic and very kind, and they are basically responsive. I asked the name Wei Yang (transliteration), because you made the elderly and the baby I bring very comfortable.

2. The hotel has complete facilities, the room is clean and tidy, and the stay is very comfortable. The front desk staff and field service are very good, very active and enthusiastic. In particular, the breakfast is also very good. There are many varieties of buffets, Western-style Chinese and fruit tea. I think the price is very high. I get up late, and the breakfast is open until 10:30. Excellent after eleven.
3. The room can have an extra bed, there is a large parking lot at the door, and the most important thing is that there is a duty-free shop bus! There is also a drop-off service! Really great value for money! You can play all day in the hotel, swim to the beach without worrying about nothing to do! In particular, there are entertainment projects such as go-karts near the hotel!
4. The room faces the sea and has a balcony. There are birds chirping while sitting, as if we are in a tropical rain forest. We stayed in a garden view room without the sea but facing the swimming pool. It doesn't matter if you don't know how to swim if you don't know how to swim! Bath towels are distributed next to the swimming pool, and you are wrapped in super warm after swimming. It's also very quiet at night, and the overall feeling of staying for a few days is very comfortable.
