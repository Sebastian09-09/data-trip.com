There are still some parts of the hotel which haven't been renovated yet (so it's a bit dusty), but overall it was a very good experience.

msg:With a perfect impression of Hotel Indigo a few years ago, I checked in again, but I didn't expect it to have closed down during the epidemic. It has now been renamed Jinlihua Hotel. The houses are still the same houses, the yard is still the same yard. It used to be the German Consulate, and later the Hotel Indigo, but it no longer has the same flavor as before. The configuration has been reduced, the bar is no longer there, and the underground garage seems to be unattended. It's a pity for such a charming old German-style building.

msg:The hotel is a courtyard surrounded by several bungalows and villas, and the appearance is good. You just need to walk out of the lobby, enter another building and then enter the door to enter your room. It is inconvenient to have too much luggage. You can go upstairs directly from the underground parking lot, but the height limit is 1.8.
On Jiefang South Road, taxis to Fifth Avenue and Italian Style Street cost 20 yuan, which is very convenient.
The room is very spacious, with a bit of a bungalow-style decoration from the Republic of China era. It is larger than the average hotel of the same level, with a large balcony and two floor-to-ceiling windows.
But the hygiene is really not in line with the hotel level. There was a lot of dust on the floor of the room. The water flows out of the shower room when taking a shower. Judging from the traces of water on the floor, it seems that this is no longer a short-term problem.
The breakfast was too perfunctory. It consisted of bread, fried eggs, bacon buns, rice porridge, wontons and very unappetizing lettuce. It was not as good as the breakfast of an express hotel.

The next thing to say is but.
The breakfast menu shocked me. How should I put it? To say that it is basically the same as Home Inn is a bit disrespectful to a hotel. I've also had Jinlihua's original breakfast, and it was pretty good.
Moving to a new place allowed me to see the world this time. The breakfast scene can be said to be horrific. I left a few bags of Haihe milk there and took it myself. Three bottled juices of different flavors are poured by yourself. And a bucket of lemonade. A pot of coffee. This is what the drink is all about.
On the menu, I saw a few fried eggs, a few slices of bacon, and a few sausages.
The staple food is a few steamed buns and a few fried dough sticks. There were pancakes and wontons.

msg:indescribable
I heard that this place used to be Haihe Indigo. I think that if the operator is changed, Indigo’s level should not drop too much, but... how should I put it, there is still a bit of Indigo’s shadow but not much

When checking in, the front desk said that it is currently in trial operation, and there are still some buildings that are not open, including the parking lot. I didn't think much about it, but after entering the room... I can only say that the preparation is still far behind... There are too many details to be improved from a five-star hotel, including but not limited to cleanliness after decoration, audio-visual system (not required to be advanced, At least make it tidy) It is best to check the renovation of facilities and equipment by yourself. Are the uniforms of the service personnel not ready yet?

I can't help but make a comment first, I was blind to Indigo's background and the house in this area

The swimming pool is so nice, the visibility is not worthy of five stars, let alone the management. If the facilities are old, they should be replaced and repaired, otherwise they are all potential safety hazards. We finished swimming and wanted to take a shower. When we opened one of the shower doors, the glass door fell off. Fortunately, we held it up in time. Otherwise, it would be hard to say, because the staff who came next... don't know if they are going to move It’s still repairing, why did the door break directly, the glass was broken all over the place in such a small space, and my friend and children were in the shower room next door, what if we happened to walk out? Everything has to be done carefully by ourselves... Even if it is a trial operation, we should make basic preparations for the operation. It is no longer a matter of five-star or not

I don’t want to make high demands on the room, let me give my evaluation first, aside from the location, the balcony and a little bit of Indigo’s shadow (such as the partial decoration style, some lamps and other soft decoration left by the new owner to save money), Jinlihua has nothing to do with five stars.

The goodness of the service staff is limited to the enthusiasm and courtesy of Tianjin people, which is still far from the standardization of five-star service.

The water bar is as simple as an economy... I have never seen such a sloppy five-star hotel

It’s a pity, let’s take a look at the picture by yourself, and I took a part of it. The gray shell on the bedside table should have been used for an emergency flashlight. ...
All the LED light *****s should have been concealed originally, and they basically fell off to varying degrees.
The bathroom floor, toilet, and corners are all remnants of decoration, losing the high-end sense of the original stone, and appearing dilapidated.
There are too many details to see the criticism...
You can make a horizontal comparison with other hotels in similar locations. I won’t give examples. It seems that I have ulterior motives. It’s a pity that this hotel has been cleaned up like this... It may also be that it has been really sluggish in the past few years. Faced with possible high-cost repairs And maintenance costs, it’s not very cost-effective, but the hotel industry is a long-term business, and it already has a good foundation. Why not renovate it and run it properly? Is this the problem of state-owned hotels? State-run hotels also do well (it is not convenient to give examples)

msg:The room is quite unique. But the elevator still smells very old. Room service is generally on the low side. I haven't lived in the previous Indigo period, so I don't know if it was the reason for changing the brand to a local operation team. Basically, you can't see the service standards of a five-star hotel, it's very casual. Hardly speaking, it is not as good as Hanting under Huazhu. If you are looking for the charm left over from the former Indigo/the German-style house, you can still spend 400-500 to experience it. Not recommended for other reasons. After the overall experience, it is a pity countless times. How can a good foundation be managed like this?

We should quickly add some commercial facilities, especially catering, and the greening of the park also needs to be done, otherwise it will look too desolate and waste Indigo's foundation.

msg:津利華是日內瓦酒店（Geneva Hotel）譯音。位於台北路德國曆史民居建築羣附近，脱胎德式別墅，硬裝用料較為考究（尤其盥洗室、衣帽間），既彰顯出五星現代國際酒店的風格，又帶有一種並不顯陳舊的年代感，入住體驗獨特。酒店處於試營業階段，可以説具有較高的性價比。


因別墅設計，酒店房型和規格各異。感謝前台領班和服務人員，為我們調整到一間心儀的房間。
