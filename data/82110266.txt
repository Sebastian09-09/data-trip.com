We also asked hotel to provide us the day trip around. Oh plus hotel has the pick up service for free. And during the say trip, they pack drink and snack box for all of us. Thats helps a lot. And the most importance things is the scenery in this hotel you can feel the Chinese culture in every detail.  This hotel is 10 out of 10.

msg:I took my children to Shangri-La, the first stop of Yunnan, and the first hotel I stayed in was Boxin. When I stayed in the hotel, I saw the promotional video in the hotel lobby and learned that there are Boxin in Sanqingshan, Meizhou, Dali, and Lijiang. The designer combined the local style in each store. I felt that the service was so good that I changed the accommodation in Lijiang and Dali to Boxin Yunshe later, because it was reassuring, safe, and considerate. The environment is shown in the picture. It is the best in Dukezong Ancient City. The rooftop overlooks the ancient city and sees the largest prayer wheel. The blue sky reflects the golden prayer wheel, which is really a feeling of spiritual purification and melting. The service is attentive. The people here are very simple and responsive. Master Zhuoma was arranged to pick up the airport in advance. At night, the child was sent an oxygen cylinder after the altitude sickness. There is also an oxygen diffuser in the room. Two handsome guys also came to debug the oxygen inhalation mode. In terms of food, I drank hot butter tea as soon as I arrived at the hotel. A butler group was established, and 7 butlers served 24 hours a day. The early meal is as shown in the picture. Order in advance every day, and there are many varieties. The most reassuring thing is the supplies. The bamboo fiber bath towels, slippers, and peach wood combs are all brand new and can be taken away. It's very considerate. I can't write more, I will comment later when I have time.

However, after I mentioned it to the hotel housekeeper, he immediately moved a chair to the end of the bed for me to watch TV. It is very thoughtful.
Hygiene: The hygiene is still remarkable. Some corners are a little dusty, but it has little impact.
Environment: The location is very convenient, in the ancient city, and what is particularly satisfactory is that it is very close to the parking lot, which is only a minute's walk away, which is very convenient.
Service: The service is the most commendable, especially warm and considerate, responsive, and also recommends a special WeChat group for better service. Once there is a problem, it will be immediately rectified and implemented in the group.

The breakfast was also very good, and there was a chance to taste the local characteristics, avoiding going out and spending money on thunder (the rice noodles and steamed dumplings were super delicious, and I wanted to show off two portions every day before going out). The local climate is a bit dry, and there are humidifiers and oxygen machines in the room. It's very comfortable to stay, and this price is definitely worth it. It's a pity that I was in a hurry this time, and I will come again next time.

I hope that the background music when entering the hotel or room can match the rich cultural a**osphere of the hotel, and don't play clichéd local songs, otherwise the quality of the entire hotel will be lowered, which is not worth it. This is easy to improve, I believe they will adjust it immediately, so it does not affect my strong recommendation!

The rooms in the hotel are very clean, the space is large enough, and there is oxygen in the room. Friends with high reflexes don’t have to worry.

The old building has a sense of historical beauty and connotation. There is a Hada to greet you when you enter the door. You can scan the code to check in while eating butter tea and snacks. I took a lot of photos and felt that I could stay in the inn for an afternoon.
I used to stay in good hotels, but the sense of surprise is much less. Talking about the difference between other big hotels, the inn is very detailed. Towels, bath towels, slippers and mahogany combs can be taken away as souvenirs. At least the cleanliness is guaranteed. Hand sanitizer, facial cleanser, body lotion and underwear washing liquid are prepared by the basin. It is very considerate~ It is worth recommending.

Breakfast: Breakfast is very local, freshly cooked and eaten, very fresh and hygienic;
Service: This trip was perfect because of the service of the butler team. The recommended attractions, restaurants, and local festivals were all very attentive, which made us very satisfied! While chatting together, they even invited me to drink a cup of milk tea, which was heart-warming~ I am willing to give full marks, they are proud of it! I wish everyone better and better!

Lijiang’s Dongba style and warm winter sunshine make me linger, and Shangri-La’s *******-style ancient houses and cultural heritage amaze me! I admire the founder’s B&B concept and have been practicing it so well. I hope Boxinyunshe can keep its original intention and move forward steadily and develop stronger and stronger! I will go to other stores to check in!

As expected, I received a call from the hotel steward just after I placed the order, informing me of the travel precautions. The travel guide was also explained in detail and clearly, and the pick-up at the station was arranged in advance. Good arrangement, efficient [strong][strong][strong] When I arrived at the store, I heard that I was recommended by a friend and they gave me a free upgrade to my room. I was pleasantly surprised. The room was very exquisite. Although it was an old-school ******* architectural style, The software facilities and supplies provided are beyond five-star! It's quiet in the midst of the hustle and bustle, the courtyard is clean and tidy, and the breakfast is hygienic without losing its character. You can see that everything is thoughtful! I have become a fan of the brand "Boxin Yunshe" and will continue to recommend it to my friends! Finally, thank you again to the butler team for providing service, you are really great!

It feels like an old friend I’ve known for a long time. It feels very warm! On the first day I came here, I felt a little dizzy and lacked energy. The dedicated butler Qiqi not only carefully explained to me what to pay attention to, but also gave me nasal oxygen in a timely manner, which really relieved me a lot! Thank you to the manager Xiaofan for always paying attention to my health. I received a message of greetings from her when I got home yesterday, which also moved us very much! I originally wanted to extend my stay, but my itinerary changed and I have to return early. My friends at Guogong Mansion, let’s make an appoin**ent again when the spring flowers bloom and go hiking together~ (I’m not good at taking photos, but the hotel is really beautiful and the cracked wall is recommended)

msg:After looking online for a long time and choosing many B&Bs, I finally chose this one. Their home gave me a very different feeling from the beginning. From the moment I made the reservation, they called me to ask if I needed to be picked up from the airport or station. , I was shocked at the time. I had stayed in quite a few hotels and B&Bs, but they were the only ones who would immediately call me to inquire about pick-up at the airport as soon as I made a reservation. And although their home is located in Dukezong Ancient City, it is very quiet inside. Outside are the lively streets of the ancient city, and inside is a quiet and warm residence. A butler will greet you every time you come in and out, and will also enthusiastically help recommend places to visit and places to visit. Helping to plan the travel route not only interprets the artistic conception of "quietness in the hustle and bustle", but also gives me a feeling of being at home. It is my first time to go to a strange environment without feeling strange, and their room key is available. What I took away as a souvenir was a keychain, so I definitely took it away without ceremony. Thank you all very much. I will come again next time!

I have high sleep requirements, and this place fully meets all my requirements. Whether it is the external environment (quiet in the middle of the bustle, convenient transportation) or the room bedding (high-quality Fuanna six-piece set), they are all very thoughtful. Moreover, this was once a chieftain's mansion. The building materials were very particular, and there were exquisite wood carvings everywhere. Listening to the housekeeper talk about the history of this house, it felt like you had arrived at a ******* culture museum!

Sifang Street and a parking lot are nearby, which is very convenient! The whole house is antique. When I opened the door leading to the courtyard, the strong ******* style immediately hit my face. Under the detailed explanation of the housekeeper Congcong (who is as special as my nickname), I learned about this house. The century-old Tusi Mansion also has a better understanding and a new understanding of ******* architectural culture! I sincerely recommend everyone who comes to Shangri-La to book here without hesitation! Boxinyunshe is still a chain store. I also chose it in Lijiang when I returned. Looking forward to it~
I would like to show you my breakfast and afternoon tea, they are very exquisite and unique~

msg:"One day, you will come to Shangri-La for any reason." It took 8 hours of stop-and-go from Lugu Lake to Shangri-La. Xiao Lu was already pulling the camper in the parking lot waiting to help us carry our luggage. . (Xiao Lu is so handsome) Rather than calling it a famous hotel or hotel, I seem to be at a loss for words for a moment, so let’s call it my distant Shangri-La home! The entrance to my "home" was particularly grand, and the first thing that caught my eye was the traditional ******* decoration. The shy and handsome boy Tashi presented us with khata, and with the word "Tashi Delek", the warm feeling of a foreign land suddenly flooded into my heart. (Tashi is so handsome) Entering the inner courtyard, I couldn't help but exclaimed, so beautiful! There’s nothing to say about the room, it’s great! My family "Qiqihejiri" has warmly prepared the pre-ordered breakfast at breakfast time. (Qiqi is so beautiful, Cili is so handsome) I am very impressed by Poxin’s coffee, breakfast, and service! In addition, I also have free special ******* clothing at home, and Qiqi and Cili patiently put it on for me. It’s worth a try! It’s simpler than the ones outside and more in line with local daily wear! Oh, by the way, the Guozhuang Dance in the nearby square is held every night from 7 to 9 o'clock, so be sure to try it and join in the fun! To be honest, Qiqi jumped very hard. (My sister Xiaofan is really beautiful)
Written in the follow-up: I seem to have suddenly found a reason to come to Shangri-La again, not because of the delicious food or the beautiful scenery. And because this time I felt the warmth of Shangri-La at minus 8 degrees, which comes from Boxin Yunshe. Thank you for meeting me, and I will go to dance Guozhuang dance with you soon! Okay, I don’t want to tell too many secrets here, because it’s worth exploring slowly and secretly by yourself.

The hotel maintains the characteristics of ancient buildings as a whole, and the professional design team gives it more technology and accommodation convenience. The overall solid wood structure is very distinctive.
The room is very large, and the bamboo fiber towels and wooden combs can be taken away with exquisite workmanship.
The humidifier, oxygen concentrator (silent), and air conditioner in the room are all very comfortable.
Breakfast is also very delicious, you can choose rice noodles, bait shreds, etc.
The snack souvenirs are also very delicious.
At the same price, it is the best in terms of cost performance, architectural culture, and location. I will choose it again in the future.

msg:The hotel is located in the ancient city, and it is very convenient to go to various attractions in the ancient city. Because it was a direct flight to Shangri-La, both adults and children had some high reflexes. Fortunately, Manager Fan of the hotel was always attentive, enthusiastic and efficient in helping our family solve many problems. In addition, all the hotel employees provide very positive and enthusiastic services, which makes people feel like home. I hope that Boxinyunshe will get better and better. Later I found out that this is a chain hotel. I will also experience other hotels of his if I have the opportunity in the future.

The most comfortable hotel I have stayed in recently. The building is beautiful and movies can be produced in minutes; the room is large and comfortable, with oxygen generators and humidifiers; the service provided by the housekeeper and store staff is comparable to that of Haidilao, who knows who is staying there. The location is also very convenient, with food and drinks within 100 meters. I am glad that I chose it between Songtsan Linka and Boxinyunshe.

msg:When coming to Shangri-La, I recommend Guogong Mansion. The hotel is located in the ancient city of Dukuzong. The hotel has a long history. I personally like the design style. There is a bookstore and a photo spot for Internet celebrities. The handsome guys and girls who serve are very good, proactive and enthusiastic, and introduce the rooms in detail. The facilities make it feel like home. I checked in just in time for Chinese Valentine's Day and I was given flowers as a gift, which was very thoughtful. The room layout is reasonable, clean and smell-free. There are two options of high pillows and latex pillows. At the same time, I personally think it is a wise choice to choose a room with oxygen supply when staying at a high altitude. The bedding is very comfortable and comes with complimentary towels, cotton and linen slippers, and a mahogany comb, all of which can be taken away and used repeatedly. We checked in with our children, and the hotel also prepared children's toothbrushes and toothpaste for our children, so we decided to stay another night. The shower water flows quickly and is equipped with higher-end shampoo and conditioner, facial cleanser, body lotion and other warm items. The breakfast is good, with many varieties and delicious taste. There will also be free fruits in the evening, which is very considerate for travelers who tend to get angry when going out. Finally, I would like to thank Manager Fan here for her strong work ability. When I communicated with her on WeChat, she quickly helped me solve any problems I had. I will definitely choose here again next time I have the opportunity to come to Shangri-La. We were very satisfied with our stay. Thank you everyone

Professional mattresses, latex pillows, and toiletries are all from Shiseido. You can also pick them up from the airport.

msg:The first night from Lijiang to Shangri-La we stayed at Baogong Mansion. The hotel does not have a dedicated parking lot, so you have to wait for a while for a parking space outside to enter, otherwise you have to park farther away. Fortunately, the hotel staff were very enthusiastic and helped with luggage. Special yogurt and snacks are provided upon check-in. The hotel is beautiful and grand. A very comfortable one night stay. Will come again if I have the chance. I like their smart toilet the most. It's just that the wooden boards in the room are a bit noisy and the stairs are a bit narrow.
In the morning, it was a buffet style, and the young lady enthusiastically helped to serve the dishes. The butter tea was very memorable, and the butter smell was very strong. When we went out to take pictures of food, the young lady also helped bring breakfast up to the children. Before leaving, there were souvenirs and some fruit to eat on the way.
Overall, very satisfied. The service provided by Gaogong Mansion is one of the best during this trip. Moreover, I had basically booked the hotel before departure for this trip, and Gao Gongfu contacted me the next morning after I booked the hotel. The day before check-in, I inquired about the arrival time and turned on the oxygen supply machine. The service is great. I will stay here again next time I have the chance.

After booking the room, the hotel manager added WeChat and kept following up on our itinerary and arrival time. He reminded us to bring more clothes because of the changeable weather. The road conditions were not so good and to prepare comfortable shoes, etc. Many details were very thoughtful.
On the day we arrived at the store, they came out to pick us up. In time for the Dragon Boat Festival, there are also rice dumplings to eat. The accommodation environment is great, antique, and I particularly like the style. The bedding and pillows are very comfortable. Towels, bath towels, slippers, and combs are of very good quality and can be taken away.
There is a dryer in the room, and you can also wash and dry it in the laundry room upstairs. This hair dryer is really great, very powerful, great news for people with hair!
The sky mirror on the roof is particularly special, and you can also see the prayer wheel.
The hotel's service is really great. ******* clothes are provided for free. They look good and keep warm. After we checked out, we came back to pick up our luggage. It was already past the check-out time. Our sisters saw that we hadn't had lunch yet, so they prepared some for us. Refreshments, delicious! The breakfast here is also delicious, and the homemade hot sauce is delicious.
In short, everything is very good. I will come to Boxinyunshe next time.

msg:This long-planned trip has finally come true. Boxin Yunshe has been booked since the epidemic in November. Due to various reasons, the customer service housekeeper has been actively cooperating with me to check out. This time I can finally come. The housekeeper Pony has added WeChat to communicate with me all the time before I moved in, giving me all kinds of reasonable travel suggestions. I am afraid that I will go to high school and feel uncomfortable. I have established a housekeeper group in advance so that I can find them at any time. Lausanne, the captain of the team who was late that day, picked me up outside the airport on time. When I arrived at the hotel, the housekeeper helped me with my luggage, booked breakfast for the next day, and turned on the room’s feeding system and air conditioner for me early. The room is big and comfortable, the bedding is clean and soft, and the slippers, mahogany comb and bath towels can be taken away, the quality is very good. The butler on the evening shift patiently introduced the meaning and story of each design in the hotel to me, which benefited me a lot. The next day Xiao Ma was worried that I couldn't find a place, so he personally took me to the place to rent ******* clothes and take pictures. The sky mirror on the top floor of the hotel must go up, it is very good, you can directly see the snow-capped mountains and the prayer wheel. The breakfast is also super super delicious! ! On the first and last day of this trip, I chose Boxinyunshe without hesitation. Thanks to the pony housekeeper, the night shift butler, and Master Lausanne. Next time you come to Shangri-La, you will definitely choose this place again. If you have 10 🌟, I will definitely give you 10 🌟 full marks! !

There are smart toilets and air conditioners. The key is to have oxygen, this really saved me. We specially chose an aerobic B&B for high altitude sickness, which allowed us to comfortably adapt to the environment. For work reasons, I always go to Japan, which has the best service in the world. The service of this B&B is even better, and the details are handled so well. Various thoughtful preparations make us feel that service is everywhere. The light of the nation must be praised! The housekeeper Xiao Zhao kept running around to pick up our luggage and recommended itineraries so that we would avoid unnecessary mistakes. Thank you.

1. The service is very good, the housekeeper responds promptly and tries his best to respond to requests.
2. The bed quality is very good, and surprisingly the pillows are also good.
3. The inn has some ******* characteristics
4. The souvenirs given before leaving were delicious, but unfortunately they were not sold in the mall.
5. Breakfast is delivered to the room and you can order by yourself, which is not bad.

shortcoming:
1. The lobby is a bit cold
2. Although slippers and bath towels can be taken away, the texture can be enhanced
3. The air conditioner is facing the bed, which makes sleeping at night not very comfortable.

The overall service is homely, but the hardware facilities are still a bit inferior compared to five-star hotels.

The toiletries used in the room are all from Shiseido. Towels, slippers, and mahogany combs can be taken away. There is even laundry detergent for underwear, which is so considerate! There is nothing to say about the hardware facilities, but the software service is more attentive. Every employee will take the initiative to say hello. They will prepare mineral water for self-driving when we go out, and tell us to bring umbrellas and add clothes. We are very touched by the short two-night experience. Finally, I hope that the epidemic situation will improve as soon as possible, and such a high-end homestay with the u**ost care will have a bright future! Thanks again 🙏

msg:I seldom write reviews now, but this time I stayed at Boxin Yunshe·Bao Gongfu, which is quite recommended. I have stayed in hotels and B&Bs for so many times. His family is very attentive, careful and considerate in every aspect. I couldn’t help but give them a Five star rating.
   First of all, before we checked in, his housekeeper contacted us in advance to provide us with pick-up service and reminded us of some precautions, especially what should be paid attention to by the elderly and children. When we got out of the airport, we saw the pick-up master waiting, and the master was still driving. It was very stable. He explained the customs of Shangri-La along the way. When we stopped at the parking lot, the exclusive housekeeper Zhao Han was waiting on the side and hurriedly stepped forward to help us with our luggage, and guided us all the way to the homestay.
  The first thing I saw when I saw the B&B was the atmosphere. The buildings were built with arches and eaves, and the colors were gorgeous. Only after the exclusive butler Zhao Han explained this "*******-style museum" did I really understand this "*******-style museum". Shallow, the picture of the unicorn at the entrance and the picture of the beast in the lobby are still red sandalwood. This Qing Dynasty ancient house has a long history and profound culture.
  We have elderly and children in our group. They also upgraded to the parent-child suite on the first floor for free, which is convenient for the elderly. As for Xiaobao, who has already played with the housekeeper, we don't have to worry at all. It is worth mentioning that their "exclusive items", mahogany combs, linen slippers, bamboo fiber towels and bath towels are all cleaned and disinfected and repackaged. They can be taken away after use and will not be reused. , I also specifically asked the little housekeeper what to do with these things if we don’t take them away. The little housekeeper said they would recycle them for public welfare, donate them to nursing homes, etc., and they were instantly warmed up by this homestay.
  For breakfast, we ate rice noodles, butter tea, highland barley, milk dregs, corn, sweet potatoes, etc., which are simple but nutritious. We also tasted the ******* characteristics, and we were full. Although we only stayed for one night, all of us are very satisfied. If the itinerary was not arranged early, we would definitely not be able to stay a few more nights.

衞生：衞生條件軟件方面很用心，有專門準備的馬桶套，浴巾毛巾都是新的很柔軟並且可以帶走，衹是硬件方面，由於是木質的藏式老宅子，主體結構是完整保留下來的，總會感覺有一股説不出來的味道，也許是我們家那位對酒店衞生比較挑剔。

msg:在雲南，泊心雲系列品牌就像是我的家，裝修風格設計都是我喜歡的很温馨的感覺，古樸中低調的奢華，很乾凈也很貼心，每個酒店配備的設施用品不説，在高海拔地區，可切換彌散式與吸入式供氧尤為重要，拯救了輕微高反頭疼的我。酒店本身就是一處風景，頂樓的天空之鏡轉經筒非常出片。這個季節的香格里拉彷彿人間天堂美麗，就如同司藤劇中一般，但旅行途中的好心情一半來自於風景，一半來自於酒店和服務，泊心雲還有一項隱藏功能是幫助訂車包車，自己擁有車隊，車型有GL8也有越野，非常安全放心。在雲南旅遊，想要好的體驗，就要💰花到位，選擇對的品牌，才能提升旅行品質感。

再説一下他們家房間內的設施設備，品質真的很高，慕思的床墊，富安娜的床品，乳膠枕，加濕器，掛燙機，全屋藍牙背景音樂，感覺不用走出房間就已經可以有一個完美假期了。細節考慮的特別周全，潔面乳、身體乳、威露士的內衣洗衣液配備的很全面，感覺就像在家裡一樣方便。
這家民宿位置很好，就在古城的停車場附近，鬧中取靜，距離四方街，月光廣場，大佛寺都很近。出行遊玩的話，據説附近的納帕海，松贊林寺，阿布集措，還有藏式晚宴都很不錯，我們根據管家的意見選了松贊林寺和藏式晚宴，玩的很開心！（店裡面有藏裝和羽絨服可以借給入住的人免費使用，很貼心）
民宿的靈魂就是民宿主和他們的故事，聊天知道，泊心雲舍在多個地方都有店，老闆祥子先生還很喜歡登山和户外，每年都去挑戰一座雪山，這個真是太厲害了，希望下次入住的時候有機會見到老闆。這裏的小管家也都很有趣，白族，納西族，藏族，傈僳族，唯一的漢族管家反倒成了“少數民族”。整個店的管家們都很贊呀。
