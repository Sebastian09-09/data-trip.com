msg:In order to bring my baby to a different Children's Day, I came to Sanya this time. Among the vast number of hotels, I compared them and finally chose Yanlord. It turned out that I did not make a wrong choice. This is really the ceiling of parent-child hotels, and the service is really nothing to say! Before checking in, there was a call to add an exclusive butler. EMILY's service was both considerate and timely. Even if we asked for an extra pillow, we had to ask clearly what type we wanted, soft, hard, cassia seed or latex, there were many choices; booking the shuttle bus was also very fast, and it was delivered immediately as soon as we said what was missing. There was also a night bed service, and the welcome fruit was also great; there were so many children's activities in the store that they could not be participated in at all, and the infinity pool was amazing! The scenery was beautiful! The breakfast was super delicious, with so many varieties that I was dazzled. The watermelon was as big as a mine, and the mango was free to enjoy. The tropical area is really a super welfare for fruit lovers. The children's playground has Qilin Fantasy on the second floor and one on the first floor. There are five swimming pools, as well as a shuttle train. Travel photography is also provided. The photographer is very serious and responsible. The mini bar is replenished in time. He said that the baby loves potato chips, so he immediately gave two more cans. It's generous! Unlike some hotels that require a lot of hassles when asking for something, all the service staff we met were smiling and sincere, without making us feel reluctant. It can be seen that the hotel also takes great care of its employees. They also helped us upgrade our room type for free to the highest 12th floor, which was great! We had a great time on Children's Day this time. Yanlord Crown Hotel is really a paradise for children! We stayed for four days and three nights and felt that we had not stayed long enough. The children were reluctant to leave. Yanlord was unexpectedly good and gave us a big surprise. I will recommend others to come here in the future!

Later, I saw the weather forecast that Haikou would have heavy rain, so I changed my mind and canceled the trip to Haikou. Then I saw on the Internet that Yanlord Crown Hotel was suitable for families and had a good rating, so I booked two nights. The night before departure, the housekeeper Melody contacted me to ask about the travel personnel and sent me a list of children's items, and prepared all the items that Xiaobao needed for me. When I arrived at the hotel, I also enjoyed the room upgrade service, which was really great. During the two days of stay, I especially praised Melidy's service. She always cared about our stay experience and responded to our needs in a timely manner. The hotel's hardware facilities are also great, the room is spacious and bright, the mini bar is replenished daily, and beach shoes are also provided. Our whole family is very satisfied with this hotel. I will continue to choose this place next year and stay a few more days.

The executive lounge has a relatively rich variety of afternoon tea and evening snacks, and the waiters and waitresses there provide very good service. There are also many children's activities in the hotel, and several swimming pools meet the needs of different groups of people for swimming pools. It is a bit regrettable that the hotel occupies a small area, and the indoor recreational facilities are a bit small or even crowded. Some indoor projects may have queues in the off-season. It is recommended to play in the outdoor swimming pool and beach.

The buffet breakfast is also delicious. There are many parent-child activities in the hotel. It is impossible to play them in four days and three nights. It‚Äôs a pity that you have to go to another hotel. If I knew it earlier, I would stay here for five nights. I was reluctant to leave. The children had a lot of fun.

msg:1. First impression upon arrival
On the way to the hotel, the scenery along the way is picturesque, with coconut trees, blue sea and blue sky, which are refreshing. After arriving at the hotel, the first thing that caught my eye was the modern ship-shaped building, which blends harmoniously with the surrounding natural environment. When checking in, the staff was warm and thoughtful, which made me feel their enthusiasm for us.
2. Room experience
I stayed in a supreme sea view room. From the floor-to-ceiling windows, the vast sea view was in full view. The room is fully equipped and exquisitely decorated, and every detail reveals the hotel's care. The bed is soft and comfortable, which made me sleep well all night.
In addition, the mini bar and other facilities in the room are also available, allowing me to enjoy a leisurely vacation time in the room. When I wake up in the morning and open the curtains, I can feel the warm sea breeze and bright sunshine, and my mood instantly becomes happy.
3. Dining experience
The hotel's dining options are rich and varied, from exquisite buffet breakfast to sumptuous dinner, every dish is memorable. The hotel's buffet breakfast is especially recommended, with fresh ingredients and a variety of delicacies that make people feast on it. In addition, the hotel's lobby bar is also a good choice. In the hot summer, sitting by the pool, enjoying cool drinks and delicious snacks, feeling the breeze and the coolness of the pool, is really pleasant.
4. Leisure facilities and services
The hotel's leisure facilities are very complete, from indoor swimming pools to outdoor beaches, from gyms to children's play areas. It is particularly worth mentioning that the hotel's parent-child facilities and services provide a lot of convenience and fun for family tourists. The parent-child facilities and activities of Sanya Haitang Bay Yanlord Crowne Plaza Hotel are rich and varied, providing family tourists with the ultimate convenience and fun.
First of all, the hotel's guest room design fully takes into account the needs of the family. The sea view room adopts an inner balcony design, which provides a safe environment for children. The room is also equipped with a variety of children's products to meet the needs of family people.
Secondly, the hotel's swimming pool area is also an excellent place for parent-child activities. The hotel has 4 outdoor swimming pools and a 270¬∞ swimming pool on the top floor, providing family tourists with a space to swim. In particular, the outdoor swimming pool also has a children's pool, allowing children to play in a safe environment. At the same time, the poolside is also equipped with parasols and lounge chairs, so that parents can enjoy a leisurely time while watching over their children.
In addition, the hotel also organizes various parent-child activities, such as dinosaur interaction, love rice balls, and circling trains, so that children can spend a happy time playing. At the same time, the hotel also has a parent-child corner, providing entertainment facilities such as small tents and toys, so that children can play with their parents.
In addition, the hotel's staff service is also very good. Whether it is the front desk reception or the room service, it makes people feel professional and caring. What satisfied us most about this stay was the enthusiastic service of the housekeeper May. She introduced the situation of the hotel to us in a timely manner, responded to our needs, and made us feel the warmth of home. In addition, the entire hotel staff always provided us with help and suggestions with a smile, making our vacation more pleasant and relaxing.
V. Summary
The time at the Crowne Plaza Sanya Haitang Bay Yanlord Hotel made me and my family spend a pleasant and unforgettable vacation. The hotel's comfortable environment, rich dining options, complete leisure facilities and warm and thoughtful service have left a deep impression on me. If you also plan to go to Sanya for vacation, you might as well consider staying in this hotel!

msg:First of all, I would like to thank my housekeeper, the lovely Miss Bonnie, for making me feel very happy about this trip to Sanya. This time I brought my children to Sanya, and I was very glad that I chose Yanlord Crown Hotel as my first hotel. Bonnie also helped us upgrade for free. During the stay, many hotel-related activities were sent to me in advance. Knowing that we have children, the fence was installed in advance, the dolls were placed in advance, and an extra dehumidifier was added for us. The hotel aunt cleaned very diligently and kept the room clean and tidy. There are two children's playgrounds in the hotel, and the facilities are relatively new. We went to play at different times and saw the service staff disinfecting. The hotel activities can be checked in and full of stamps can be exchanged for game coins.
Here I would also like to thank Kevin, the manager of the hotel buffet restaurant, because our children have allergies, so we need to pay special attention to diet. Manager Kevin first asked about the baby's allergens, and then asked in detail what food can be eaten. Finally, my baby's meals were made for us separately, which is really heartwarming.
We originally planned to stay in three hotels during our trip to Sanya, and two of them were MGM, which was great, but these two hotels were really a bit too much. The hotel hygiene was worrying, there was pot ash in the children's meals, and there were fallen leaves in the children's swimming pool. There were also protruding safety hazards in the swimming pool, which caused my child to fall. Fortunately, my husband was quick and quickly pulled my daughter up, but she still choked on water. I originally wanted to stay for three days, so I temporarily canceled the next two days of the trip and stayed in Yanlord again. This time, I felt very warm when I entered the room. Fence toys, dehumidifiers, whatever, Bonnie had already arranged them for me in advance. It really felt like home.

I was full of expectations for the hotel, but I didn't expect it! I was even more surprised when I arrived at the scene~üåºBed guardrails, birthday decorations, heightened stools, small cakes, Bulgari toiletries, additional welcome fruits, facial cleansers, and helped to wash the baby's clothes for free. The most important thing is that we also upgraded to the Supreme Sea View Room. Our room number 1003 is close to the bow and facing Atlantis. It's really invincible! Thank you very much for the two-day care of the housekeeper Diana, which saved me a lot of worries. The most important thing is that the travel photography given by the hotel is not a rip-off! 10 free photos, and an additional one is only 20 yuan, and there is a free bus to the airport. It's simply... The ceiling is the ceiling~ You have to swipe your card to enter the beach, and you feel full of private enjoymentüèñÔ∏èAnyway, it's perfect, thank you! Great recommendationüíñ

There are 3-4 outdoor swimming pools, all with lifeguards watching the scene, towels and water are sufficient, children must bring lifesaving equipment when entering the water, the swimming pool is very clean, the 15th floor infinity pool has a very good view, and the water depth is 1.2, suitable for adults and children. There are not many people on the beach, but the waves in Haitang Bay are too big to go into the water. Dig sand and step on the water, but the waves are big and take pictures. There are also many people in the off-season for breakfast. You have to queue during peak hours. The food is very rich and the fruit is well received! The hotel's restaurant is expensive, but the quality is nothing to say. The water-stewed chicken in the Chinese restaurant is suitable for children. The pasta and hamburgers in the children's restaurant are good. You can also order food by the 15th floor swimming pool. In short, the hotel quality is very good, the price for off-peak travel is also reasonable, and the housekeeper melody is considerate and well-received! There is a big brother from the Northeast on the beach who digs crabs. 100 yuan with children to dig a few. It depends on luck. The ones we dig are very big! ! ! Doing business is not easy, and it is worth it for children to have fun.

Facilities:
Because it has not been open for a long time, it is still very new. And it looks very good.

Hygiene:
It is very good. I think it is a hotel where you can use bath towels directly. Moreover, the waiter came to adjust the room lights and replenish the minibar at night. It was very attentive.

Service: The front desk manager Xiao Jia provided very good service. Because we were 4 adults and 2 children, he specially arranged a medium bag to pick us up from the duty-free shop and send us to the airport. And he gave the children a small gift, which he liked very much. ü•∞ I would like to especially praise the front desk lady on duty in the executive corridor. She is thin and polite. She took the initiative to help the children find a stroller. She has a strong sense of service.
Overall, it is very good. We stayed in Tianyu, Yat, and Yanlord. We will come again.

msg:Looking at the reviews online, I wondered if the good reviews were fake. I tried Yanlord and was pleasantly surprised. The service was excellent and the breakfast was rich in variety. There were also many activities for children. The housekeeper Avril provided attentive service at all times. I couldn't resist changing my flight and stayed for another night.

msg:The first time I took my baby on a long trip, of course I had to choose Sanya Hotel! Experience Ambassador Emily contacted us on WeChat one day in advance, told us about the hotel's travel precautions and gave us a travel schedule. Because it was the baby's first time to see the sea, I asked for a room with a better view. Emily upgraded us to a Supreme Sea View Room. The baby liked the double balcony very much. Every morning, his favorite thing was to go to the balcony to see the sea. Because I was more particular about pillows when I was away from home, I had a stiff neck on the first night. After contacting Emily, she provided us with a latex pillow in time, so that we had a good rest in the next few days. Because it was the off-season, there were not many people at breakfast, and the variety was very rich. The baby especially liked the chocolate fountain~
Water gun battles and bubble battles are the baby's favorites, and the staff will be very dedicated to playing with the baby. The indoor amusement park is a good place for babies to make friends. The wind on the 15th floor infinity pool is a bit strong. Remember to bring the bathrobe provided by the hotel when you take your baby there. Towels are provided by the pool. The hotel beach provides sand digging toys. It is recommended to go in the evening when it is not so sunny, and children can play for a long time.
It happened to be Mother's Day. When we returned to the hotel at night, they provided us with a turndown service and we received carnations. The thoughtful and warm service left us with wonderful memories for our family of three.

msg:giao~ I want to blow up this hotel! ! This hotel was recommended to me by someone else. He told me that the 600-700 hotels in Sanya are all the same, and the pictures are very different from the actual ones, and you will be disappointed! The hotels I stayed in the first two days of Hainan really fulfilled his words. It was so disappointing. So I chose this place without hesitation. I have experienced the high-end service ceiling. Before I arrived at the hotel, I received a call from the hotel to confirm the room type. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, someone came out to greet us and help with the luggage. The luggage can be stored and delivered to the room later. After entering the lobby, there will be a young lady holding a wreath for you to wear~ The flowers are still fresh flowers. The check-in ceremony is 666. The hotel room is clean, tidy and generous, and it smells good as soon as you enter. The balcony is fried chicken-sized, and the scenery is great! There are fruits on the table, which are very fresh and sweet... The drinks and potato chips in the refrigerator are free, and there is also a small doll for free. But I think the light in the room is a little dim. There is nothing wrong with the rest! Kily is a very nice and considerate lady. She sent me warm messages when I was staying at the hotel. When I left the hotel, she cared whether I had arrived at my destination safely. I left something in the hotel, and I kept communicating with Kily. I was very embarrassed to bother her. Finally, I found the things and sent them back to me free of charge. I was really touched. The layout was full... There were so many small details that I didn't expect! It was done very well. I personally think that this hotel is impeccable... Needless to say, I will come to Sanya next time! ! 
I am a person who is too lazy to write reviews, but I am very willing to write down my experience of staying in this hotel and share it here. There are a lot of words, like writing a small essay... I hope you don't mind.

msg:Having stayed at MGM, Sheraton, and Marriott in Yalong Bay, I wanted to go to Haitang Bay to experience it. I stayed at Yanlord, the ceiling of parent-child activities. The parent-child activities started from 9:30 until the evening. The room was also very clean. The aunt was very considerate to put a towel under the toiletries bag. The child was a little afraid of the dinosaur activities. The hotel staff was very careful to coax the child. The housekeeper Bonnie was very responsible, from the beginning of check-in to check-out, to the considerate sunscreen repair reminder, to asking you in advance when you leave, and helping you book a car. It is really a fully responsible housekeeper. Although there are some shortcomings, the advantages have covered the small flaws. In short, it is not a trust, but a real review. Next time I go to Sanya, I will choose Yanlord without hesitation.

The hotel provides children's bathtubs, children's toothbrushes, children's slippers, cribs, bed guards, and a minibar with many drinks. There is also endless mineral water, and snacks. There are snacks delivered to the room in the afternoon. The room is cleaned very frequently every day. The swimming pool is also very suitable for children to play. There are many activities and you can't play every day. It is definitely the ceiling for parent-child. Most importantly, my two-year-old baby likes this hotel the most after staying in several hotels. I will come to Yanlord to stay with my children next time~

msg:I did a lot of homework online in advance, and there were both good and bad ones. After I actually came, the experience was still good. We drove by ourselves and arrived just after 3 o'clock. There was one person in front of us, and we checked in in ten minutes. A few days before check-in, the customer service depar**ent contacted us and communicated all the children's products we needed, so the room was very complete after check-in. The full sea view room I stayed in had an unbeatable view. It was very healing to lie on the balcony without doing anything every day. There were many and rich breakfast options, and the children could eat in different ways; the Chinese restaurant was good value for money and tasted very good, and the children ate a lot; the afternoon tea and dinner in the executive lounge were also great, and they could really be eaten as a full meal, especially Starbucks coffee was great to drink at any time. The children liked the infinity pool and water park very much, and they went there every day. The indoor children's park was not too big, and it might be in short supply during the peak season. The wind and waves in Haitang Bay were really huge. After the tide went out, you could step on the water, but it was impossible to go into the sea. The hotel also reminded that you could not go swimming in the sea. Overall, the experience during my stay was perfect. The housekeeper Emma was very warm and thoughtful. She asked if the bedding was comfortable, whether I needed ginger tea before bed, etc. The lady who cleaned the room was also very friendly.

The lobby is very transparent. As soon as you come in, there are waiters to help with luggage, guide check-in, and send flowers. The waiting time is longüà∂Soft drink tickets are given.

msg:Internet celebrity hotel, the management group does a good job in marketing, the service looks good, the housekeeper greets you in real time, asks you if you need anything, and then says sorry that you can't. You can stay in any hotel in Sanya and the service is absolutely OK, so this one can't be said to be good or bad. The hotel public area is actually very average, very average, compared with the Rosewood Edition Park Hyatt Christie, it is a world away. The infinity pool is just a gimmick. During the stay, the luxury sea view is 2,800 yuan a day, which is more cost-effective than the last stay at the Sofitel Haitang Bay. The breakfast is better and the price is 60% off year-on-year. This time I was fooled by watching the video account. I have stayed in almost all the five-star hotels in Sanya. This one is very average. Maybe my son is 8 years old and older, so the so-called parent-child activities are not interesting to the children at all. The swimming pool is also relatively small. Compared with vacation, you must not choose it. It is very noisy and there are too many children. The hotel details are good, but it costs 30 yuan to get a sanitary napkin, which is acceptable, but you can't swipe the card, you have to pay in person. The mall provides one for free the first time. Also, after checking in, I kept calling to get good reviews. The housekeeper who didn't solve the problem kept sending messages to get good reviews, which made me feel extremely uncomfortable. To be honest, it's just an Internet celebrity hotel, very average, and I don't recommend it when comparing hotels of the same price. The public areas are very average, not good, and the restaurants are also very average. Don't choose it if you want to take photos and check in. It's okay to bring a baby, there is a stroller.

The entire hotel has a unique exterior shape, magnificent a**osphere, and it is especially interesting to take pictures. We are three adults and one child. We stayed in a deluxe family sea view room with ample accommodation space and no sense of compactness. It was also very comfortable to blow the sea breeze on the external balcony. The swimming pool is the favorite of the children. The girl played in each swimming pool one by one, and she was still unsatisfied every time. If you are afraid of the sun or at night, you can go to the rooftop infinity pool. It is recommended to go once during the day. The view from a distance is particularly good! The most commendable thing is that heated bath towels are provided around the swimming pool. The children wrap them directly after coming up, and they are warm. The hotel directly crosses the coconut grove to the coastline. There is no need to cross the road, which is very safe. There are also many children's participation projects provided in the store. Everyone can experience it by themselves when they have time. The geographical location is very close to the duty-free shop and not far from Wuzhizhou Island. The service of the experience hall Luna is very enthusiastic, and all kinds of unknown situations are given good answers and suggestions. In short, this stay experience is very good and worth recommending!

I set out with some worries about being disturbed. I arrived at the hotel at almost 8 o'clock in the evening and was told that we had been upgraded to the Supreme Ocean View Room on the 12th floor. Check-in During this period, I slept very well and was not disturbed by the sound. Except for the smell when I entered the room on the first night, the rest of the experience was great. After noticing the smell, Melody Chen immediately arranged to send a purifier. In addition, we were much better after ventilating it for a while. We checked into the room that night. There is a surprise. The bed is carefully decorated and very beautiful. Thank you for your thoughtfulness. The welcome gifts in the room are all available, including fruits, Bvlgari toiletry sets, drinks and wine bars replenished daily, etc. The cleaning is also very timely, there is also night room service, and the breakfast is also very rich. We stayed for three nights. During our stay, Melody Chen greeted us every day and cared about whether we were satisfied with our stay and whether we needed help. On the third night, she also gave us a bottle of red wine, a fruit plate and a bubble bath, which made our stay smooth. The experience has been up, and I feel the high level of five-star service. I would like to thank Melody Chen for her meticulous and considerate care. I wish you success in your work and your advancementüåπI will see you again if you stay at Yanlord again in the futureüòä

It focuses on comfort and relaxation. Among the parent-child hotels in Sanya that I have stayed in, Yanlord is the ceiling of parent-child hotels. The environment and hygiene are naturally excellent. The hotel is equipped with a series of toiletries and sunscreen for children. Mothers almost don‚Äôt need to make any extra preparations. There are also many free products for infants and young children, such as milk warmers, bed guards... If you have any needs, just tell the housekeeper in advance. Our Crown Experience Ambassador Jayden is really responsive and responds to everything, and almost immediately. The hotel‚Äôs mosquito prevention is really good. It was great. The child was not bitten. The hotel has various children's play facilities so that the children can play for a whole day without leaving the hotel. There are many children's activities. My daughter's favorite bubble party must be checked in every day. The breakfast at Yanlord is also an important point of returning to the hotel. If you get up late, you can solve the problem of lunch together. There are many people staying but you will not feel crowded or messy. The breakfast food is very sufficient. You can sleep until you wake up naturally without worrying about it. There is also a free special travel photo, 10 free photos and a small video. Anyway, Yanlord is a one-stop service for eating, drinking, playing and being comfortable. The main feature is to save money. I will come again during the summer vacation

The housekeeper Jenny helped us solve many problems. There were some small episodes in the room at the beginning, but she tried her best to help us solve them in the end, which was also a success. She also sent snacks before checking out.
I love breakfast the most, and my baby loves it the most. I can eat a lot of food. The freshly squeezed juice is super delicious, and the coffee can also be packed. The variety is different every day, and the beef noodles are invincible and delicious. It's just that sometimes there are many people and it seems a bit chaotic, but fortunately the restaurant is very large.
The children's activities are a bit simple. Sometimes the brothers and sisters who do the activities don't seem to be very enthusiastic, and their affinity is a little worse. The children's restaurant is really good. The set meal is rich and nutritious, and you can make notes. The service staff has a super good attitude. I am impressed by a boy who always smiles and speaks slowly every time. I don't know what his name is.
The quilt will still be a little damp when the air conditioner is turned on every day. Clothes can be hung on the balcony and can be dried when there is sunshine. The sand in Haitang Bay is finer than that in Yalong Bay. After the tide goes out, there are jellyfish and unidentified marine creatures on the beach, which is quite interesting.

Whether it was the room, supporting facilities, or sanitary conditions, they were all great. I think it was worth staying for more than 1,600 a night. If I come to Sanya next time, I will probably come here again.
Minibar once a day: mushroom power, sea****, potato chips, water bar.
Infinity pool on the 15th floor, with a great view. The location of room 911 is also very good, - sea view, and I just happened to see the Atlantis 6th anniversary drone show, the location is great

msg:Let me start with the conclusion. You will never regret going on a family vacation.

Many advantages have been mentioned in other reviews, such as travel photography, daily fruits and mini-bars, and rich children's activities. I would like to add a few points.

(1) There are several safety officers and lifeguards at each swimming pool and children's pool slide in the hotel. They are very serious about their work and are not formalistic. I saw several children doing dangerous actions and they were immediately stopped. It is really reassuring to take your children to play in the pool.

(2) The hotel's service is really impeccable. Before I came, Emily contacted me by phone and WeChat to confirm the check-in personnel and other information. During the five-day stay, she responded quickly to all requests. Not only Emily, but other staff members were also very patient and friendly. They helped us a lot. Due to weather reasons, the plane was delayed by two hours. Emily applied for an additional delay for us in addition to the delay in check-out. I am really grateful to Emily and all the staff for their help.
(3) The first choice for families. The hotel is often full, but it is not like a popular hotel that is like a vegetable market. During my stay at Yanheng, I felt very quiet, without any noise, especially at night, it was very quiet, so I think it is the first choice for families. You can have fun in the hotel with peace of mind. The activities are rich and safe, and adults don‚Äôt have to worry.
(4) There are a few other details. Takeaways usually cannot be delivered directly to the room, but you can take a shuttle bus in the lobby to the door to pick up the food cabinet. No matter when you go, there will be a staff member driving, which is very convenient. If you really don‚Äôt want to run, you can also ask the hotel staff to deliver it to the hotel room. I am also curious why robots are not used. Because there are many children in the hotel, using robots is afraid that some accidents will affect the safety of children. They have made very good considerations in terms of safety and convenience of check-in, which deserves praise.

msg:We had breakfast in a buffet restaurant with many choices. Fruits such as papaya were served in a big bowl. There were Hainan specialty Hou'an noodles, Hainan pickled noodles, Xinglong coffee, and pandan coconut jelly that could be made into homemade soup. For lunch and dinner, we chose the children's restaurant and the Chinese restaurant. The price was quite expensive, but the taste was very good. Members got a 10% discount. The Chinese restaurant gave us a big bowl of fruit after the meal. We booked a deluxe king-size bed room for Wednesday. Lisa upgraded us to the Supreme Sea View Room by two room types. We were very happy. The room was cleaned twice a day. It was very clean and tidy. There was a lot of water. There were bottled water and big blue towels next to the swimming pool. The service was very considerate. You have to swipe your card to enter and exit the beach, but there were many salesmen like riding horses, throwing fireworks, and promoting taking pictures. Because the beach is not private, it is very convenient to borrow sand digging tools for children. The hotel also provided travel photography services. We took a lot of photos at the beach, coconut forest, and in front of the hotel. If you exceed 10 photos, the charge is 20 yuan per photo. If you take more photos, you can choose a package. The children also played a bubble show, the hotel made snacks and a small train. The snack making needs to be booked in advance on the mini program. On the first day of stay, Bulgari and crab dolls were given as gifts. Lisa also gave a small cake the night before check-out, and a captain doll was given as a gift on the day of check-out. The children were very happy! Thanks to Lisa, I will stay at Yanlord Crowne Plaza Hotel next time!

I received a call from the hotel staff Jayden before I checked in. He arranged everything for us properly and responded to any needs in a timely manner.

The housekeeper Lisa was very busy but also quite dedicated. The hotel has a wide field of view and various facilities are relatively complete. The children had a lot of fun. The buffet breakfast was relatively rich. The overall stay experience was good.

First of all, the housekeeper Luck was very enthusiastic and added me one day in advance. Fortunately, my room was upgraded to an invincible sea view room. As soon as I entered the room, it was comfortable and warmly decorated, and I could add free bottle sterilizers, building blocks, children's tents, etc. etc‚Ä¶ 
     The hotel's bubble party was really fun, the children were really happy, and the hotel's children's facilities are also very good. Speaking of food and beverages, the breakfast was also delicious. The two noodles I had were very fragrant and the papaya was particularly sweet. I ate at the children's restaurant and the taste was not surprising at all.
      I had a very comfortable sleep during the two nights at Yanlord. The bedding was good. Facial cleanser, children's sunscreen, laundry detergent, etc. were provided, which was very comprehensive.
   Finally, we took the photo in a hotel. The photo was very good. The photographer was very patient and did not promote anything.
    Next time I come back, I will come back to Yanlord again. Thank you to my housekeeper, who provided me with consultation and help in every aspect, and almost always responded within seconds, which gave me a great experience ‚ù§Ô∏è

The baby's toilet, building blocks, tent, etc. I had a sore throat when I checked in, and she sent me rock sugar and snow pears, which was very heartwarming. This is a hotel I will definitely stay in when I go to Sanya. The service is very different from that of a certain St. Regis, and the initiative is very high. There are different parent-child activities every day, divided by age groups, and the activities are very rich. The baby likes it very much, and I will definitely come again next time!

msg:Dear hotel leaders:
We stayed in room 619 from April 6 to April 8, 2024. Special thanks to the staff who served our family during this period! At the same time, I salute the hotel for being able to cultivate such excellent service staff (as a hotelier, I can deeply understand the hardships and difficulties of hoteliers)!
Here I would like to thank the following people in particular:
1. Hotel front desk Zhang Chuchu (Riki): Special thanks to the busy help during the check-in period to select a room that I am satisfied with both the elderly and the children, and to meet the different needs of the two elderly people. Super awesome! ! !
2. Butler Li Mei (May): Thank you for your warm greetings every day, and for helping to arrange a travel itinerary suitable for our family, and asking about the sleep during the stay. Like!
3. VIP Lounge Elsa: Thank you for seeing her sweet smile every day to welcome us to eat and remember each of our dining habits. Like! ! !

msg:I really made a guide for several days and decided on this hotel. I really made the right choice. You will be welcomed with a garland as soon as you enter. There will be a butler when you check in. I have added WeChat so you can contact him if you need anything. He said you will welcome fruits and children when you check in. I forgot to deliver the good night milk, so I contacted the housekeeper and it was delivered shortly. I also gave a Bvlgari toiletry set, a small crab doll, and the hotel provided indoor slippers and outdoor slippers.
The hotel actually provides sunscreen, toilet water, laundry detergent, and sunscreen is provided at the swimming pool downstairs. Baisuishan is free of charge. I can‚Äôt swim and my child is five years old. I put a swimming ring on him and he was working the whole time. The staff looked at it and I was really reassured. The children's pool is at a constant temperature, which is perfect.
By the way, the most important thing is that my son‚Äôs birthday is on the 4th. We happened to leave the hotel on the 4th. I told the housekeeper, and the housekeeper sent a small cake and birthday decorations on the 3rd. My son has been looking forward to it all day. It‚Äôs really nice. Has a sense of ritual
There are so many varieties of breakfast, and it‚Äôs available until 11 o‚Äôclock, so you can almost have breakfast and lunch in one.
By the way, the butler Jayden is really responsive to all requests. The butler service is really a plus. This is the first stop in Sanya. I am really satisfied.

Travel photography in the hotel: We originally had 10 free negatives, but the housekeeper Jayden gave us 20. There was no compulsory consumption during the entire travel photography process. Everyone in the travel photography process was very nice.
Minibar once a day: replenished daily, including snacks and drinks
Exclusive access to children's activities and facilities in the store: My son participated in the small kitchen activity and taught him how to make burgers. He was very happy
I haven‚Äôt finished the family activities for three days and two nights. I look forward to choosing this hotel again during my next trip to Sanya.

They upgraded the room for free. The service experience is really much better than Atlantis (stayed here during this trip) Two hotels), if you bring children, this hotel is very suitable to stay. There will be many activities, and the beach is also exclusive. The quality of the beach is better than that of Atlantis, and there is less dirt in the sand. It's a pity that I only stayed for one night. I can stay here again next time. There is a disadvantage. The hotel is basically open-air outside the room. It will be a bit hot, but the ventilation is good.
Photographed in the hotel: There is no force or promotion, which is commendable, but I still bought some more photos for 20 yuan each.
Complimentary Bvlgari toiletry set on the first day of check-in: This is useless, no comment
Welcome fruit on the first day: The fruit is very good, better than Atlantis, very delicious, good quality, especially coconut.

Before check-in, Lisa, the hotel experience ambassador, took the initiative to contact and introduce hotel-related information and parent-child entertainment projects. Yanlord focuses on family hotels, so there are relatively many children, and the occupancy rate is also high, but this will not affect the quality of hotel service at all. If there is a need, the staff will solve it quickly. There was a heavy rain during my stay, so I informed Lisa, the experience ambassador, to help collect clothes. Lisa also informed the room colleagues immediately and quickly helped solve the problem. Thumbs up üëç. Lisa reminded us of the relevant services available at the hotel when we checked in, promptly reminded us of meal times and introduced meal-related information, which made us feel that Yanlord has a full range of services.

I was very satisfied with the three-day and two-night experience. The hotel details are very good. There are many children's play items and equipment, as well as weekly activity information at different times. The most favorite thing is this super large balcony and fully transparent glass. You can see the sea view while lying on the sofa.
Crowne Plaza Experience Ambassador Lisa is very considerate and thoughtful. She took the initiative to inform the children of the items they can borrow and recommended Hainan's specialties. On the first night, she also told us the time and place of breakfast very considerately. She also responded to our questions very quickly. It was a very pleasant holiday experience. I will choose Yanlord Crowne Plaza next time I come to Hainan.

Compared to Atlantis, where we stayed two days ago, it was very quiet. The only drawback was that the restaurant was too noisy. Miss Avril, the exclusive housekeeper, is very considerate and will communicate various needs and solve various problems in advance. The most important thing is that the hotel has strollers that can be borrowed, but the only regret is that we were asked to upgrade the room when we checked in, because it was not successful because of the high and low beds.

msg:The main purpose of staying at Yanlord Crown for two days was to take the kids out and let themselves go. The overall feeling is quite nice, and the service from the housekeeper Kliy is also very considerate. Almost all questions answered.
Facilities: The overall facilities feel OK after staying there, but the toilet is not a smart toilet and it feels a bit inconsistent with the level of the hotel. The baby's toilet seat does not match the toilet very well. Children's hands were crushed during use. It is recommended to consider it for babies around 2-3 years old. There are also children's toothbrushes that have the same problem. In addition, the hair dryer in the room cannot be moved and can only be fixed in one position. Although you can borrow a mobile one, it is not of the same level as the original hair dryer in the room, which is not very user-friendly. Other aspects feel OK. There is also letter paper and pencils available in the hotel. The pencils cannot be used. Although it is understandable that they are not sharpened to prevent the baby from getting hurt, they are basically not available and I don‚Äôt think they are suitable. üòÇ
Hygiene: I have nothing to say about hygiene, including the fact that the waiters cleaned in a timely manner and the room was very clean.
Environment: The overall environment of the hotel is beautiful, and the swimming pool is also good. Personally, I think there should be a reminder for the swimming pool where babies play. The first time I took my child under the big bucket, I was really shocked. Because he was a baby, it was quite scary the first time he was flushed with water. The little baby was a little frightened on the spot, which affected his mood for the day's play. The beach belonging to the hotel has very fine and comfortable sand. Our baby likes it very much. It is very close to the hotel and is more convenient. At the same time, there are sand digging toys for rent nearby, which is very nice and humane.
Service: I think the overall service of the hotel is very good. The butler Kily's service is also great and he will give us various types of recommendations. The room was also upgraded for us. The sea view is also very nice. The service in all aspects is impeccable!
Based on the overall experience, I personally feel that the hotel's activities are suitable for children who are already in kindergarten and above, but there are relatively few projects suitable for babies and children below day care. The hotel's infinity pool and rooftop buffet barbecue are also recommended. Personally, I feel that the self-service barbecue has too little seafood, which is different from the overall price. Of course, when it‚Äôs half price or on sale, I think you can still give it a try. The hotel's breakfast is also quite rich and has a wide range of categories. It's just that you have to wait to pick up the dishes during peak hours. Relatively speaking, if you go to the juice category later in the day, you may not be able to wait.
That's about it. Thank you again to all the hotel staff for their warm service and Miss Kily for her caring butler service! When the baby is older, we will choose it again if we have the chance!

msg:I stayed at Yanlord 4 years ago and thought it was so great that I never had the chance to go back again. Until this year with my two children, I chose Yanlord again without hesitation. The day before check-in, Miss Kily added WeChat to ask if there are any needs, and also sent various tips and benefits of the hotel. Every day after check-in, she would ask on WeChat if there are any other needs, and the needs would be answered within 5 minutes. So efficient. When traveling with children, you must choose Yanlord. The children will be happy without the mother having to worry about it, and the trip will end happily. Kily greeted me when I got home, which was so heart-warming. A pleasant trip to Sanya has ended. I look forward to seeing you next time!

The room supplies are amazingly complete - bathtub cover, toilet water, sunscreen, facial cleanser, shower loofah, iron and ironing board, as well as Bluetooth speakers, and a welcome little crab doll. We are members and received a welcome drink. Needless to say, the open-air heated swimming pool is a must-visit point of the hotel. The water temperature is very suitable. When we went there in the morning, the wait was not too big, which was perfect. It is worth mentioning that our housekeeper Stacy was very friendly and helpful. She communicated my needs in advance and tried her best to meet my needs. She also helped me find the clothes I left behind and mailed them to me. She is an angel housekeeper for sure. , would recommend my sisters to stay here

msg:This is definitely a stop when you bring your baby to Sanya, after all, it has long been famous in the mother-to-be community. I just came from the Park Hyatt. To be honest, my first impression of the room setting was a little different. In fact, everything else was very good. It was just because I am a coffee lover that I felt a little uncomfortable when there was only instant coffee in the room. But fortunately, the hotel offers various kinds of coffee. Takeaway is very convenient. And the key point is that Yanlord Crown has definitely achieved the ultimate in all software and hardware services at its own price level. Our housekeeper Kily contacted me the day before we checked in and helped me book activities for the next day. The communication was also very pleasant and efficient, helping me check in smoothly the next day, and the children went to check in when I checked in. I happily participated in the event, it was really great! And throughout the whole stay, Kily was very considerate and thoughtful, providing all kinds of help and responding to every request, which was amazing and unforgettable. Back to the room, the decoration style is simple and elegant, and the space is large. You can enjoy the beautiful sea view and Atlantis's drone show from the balconyüòÜThe buffet breakfast is very local and the service is also very good, but there are so many peopleüòÖ Finally, talking about the children's activities, Kily gave me a map and timetable. At first, I listened attentively. My inner shock continued to escalate during her introduction. It‚Äôs so rich too! It really deserves to be the ceiling of a family hotel in Sanya. After the child came back, he was still introducing the brothers and sisters here to his grandparents. Especially Brother Crab is so kind to the childrenü•πThank you. I will definitely stay here next time I go to Sanya.

Lisa's condolences and care from time to time were also given to the children. Small snacks were delivered, which is perfect for a family vacation. It doesn't cost a mother. Every staff member is enthusiastic, attentive and considerate. My son was injured before he checked in. Jessica from the hotel brought a professional medicine box to comfort his son and bandage the wound. It was really amazing. She is so pampering to her guests.

You can imagine the destructive power of three children under the age of 3. I don't know, but they were able to clean it without complaining, allowing us three mothers to still have time to put on makeup. Hot towels and mineral water are the basics everywhere.

She is still responsible, enthusiastic, patient and meticulous. I am also very satisfied with the room arrangement. I called Miss Kily like crazy.

Facilities: The room facilities are very complete, and the spare small items are also complete, including mosquito repellent, sunscreen, laundry detergent, and even toilet covers and bathtub covers. There are many facilities for children in the hotel, and my child felt like he didn't finish playing for four days.

Service: The service is very good, the cleaning is timely, and the service staff are very polite. After check-in, you will be fed various kinds of food, including drinks, snacks, cookies, etc. in the lobby bar. The minibar is replenished every day. My children love to drink coconut milk, and the service staff will help replenish more. Milk is also delivered to the child every night. The hotel also gives away a travel photoshoot, which includes ten photos, and there is no compulsory consumption.

All in all, when you have a baby and don‚Äôt know which hotel to choose, you can‚Äôt go wrong staying at Yanlord.

The view of the heated swimming pool on the 15th floor is super beautiful! I am very satisfied with the travel photography, and I happily paid for it to add photos, hahaha, the editing is also very good! I would like to give special mention to my housekeeper Doris. She contacted me on WeChat a few days in advance and kept in touch. She also asked me in advance what children‚Äôs supplies I needed. I ordered several items and had them all laid out for me when I checked in. La!

If I had anything to ask about during my stay, she responded immediately and implemented it. It was a really good experience! The bed is also very comfortable. Once you lie down on the leisure bed on the balcony, you won't want to get up. All the facilities in the public areas of the hotel really tell you that you need to be comfortable during your vacation. The chairs in the lobby are all for you to lie down on! The Bvlgari bath set that comes with check-in is very useful, and the welcome fruit is a big bowl! If I have the chance, I will choose Yanlord again!

It was my first time traveling in Sanya and the results were very good. The elderly at home liked it very much. The temperature of the heated swimming pool on the 15th floor of Yanlord was very hot, but the wind was too strong. Hot ginger tea and mineral water are provided, and the staff will also wear life jackets for the baby. The service is very good. It was New Year's Eve on the 31st, so I saw fireworks and drones. The beach provides sand digging tools, bath towels, and mineral water, which children like very much. There are many children's activities every day.

msg:I came to Sanya on the 2nd and stayed in several hotels. Only the Yanlord Crowne Plaza Hotel made me miss it. There are activities for my children to play with all day long, which really frees up my hands (and each activity does not require extra money). See We have a few children and they thoughtfully upgraded us to a family room! What impressed me the most was Diana‚Äôs service. She was attentive and responsive every other moment. She almost responded to every request. My child had a stomachache and vomited in the middle of the night. She even helped make porridge in the morning. It was delivered in an insulated box! They also allowed us to check out late. Thanks to this perfect service, we will stay a few more days next time we come to Sanya!

msg:These 5 days and 4 nights left a very good stay experience for our family. Yanlord is truly a family-friendly hotel. The beach in front of the hotel has very fine sand and rich vegetation, making it great for photos. The hotel has a fresh and high-end smell, the rooms are cleaned daily, there are no mosquitoes, and the swimming pool is also very clean. The facilities are complete, including a free train, free toys on the beach, and an area for washing sand, hot towels are provided in the swimming pool, and the elevator is extremely smooth. What‚Äôs more worth mentioning is the hotel‚Äôs service. Emily was basically on call on WeChat, helping us make reservations for airport transfers, duty-free shop transfers, and parent-child games. Because our room didn‚Äôt have a balcony, she also sent our clothes for dry cleaning. What‚Äôs touching is that at 9pm, when the baby‚Äôs feet hurt, a doctor came to check and deliver medicine. The travel makeup and services provided by the hotel are also very good. Family favorites are the bubble party and the infinity pool on the 15th floor. They are both constant-temperature and friendly to the elderly and children. The play area and pool staff took good care of the kids! Not to mention the hotel's breakfast, which has both Chinese and Western food, including Hou'an noodles, pickled noodles and other specialties. There are donuts and popcorn that children love. You can also make your own cones, the fried dough sticks are super crispy, and the freshly squeezed juice is amazing!

It would be perfect if there were more children's play facilities! You can see Yate very clearly from the balcony. The only drawback is that the building is so big that it is easy to get lost and there are no signposts. The housekeeper Emily is very warm and gentle, highly praised!

I would like to greatly praise my exclusive ambassador Melody Chen. She is super gentle and very considerate. She gave a lot of water to the children when they wanted to drink milk. She also notified all services at all times in advance. This time, Yanlord Crown has already Extremely satisfied.
Yanlord is basically the limit for parents and children. We, who are 1 and a half years old, are not able to participate in many, but it is great to feel the a**osphere.
This time the hotel only had the breakfast and dinner buffet in the western restaurant. There wasn't a lot of food, but it was quite high-quality and the ingredients were fresh and very good.
I will definitely choose Yanlord Crown again next time!

msg:This is the most satisfying hotel I have stayed in recently
Every detail reflects meticulous service and meticulous attention to detail.
The only regret is that I only stayed for one day
1. Welcome drinks are given upon check-in, even for children.
2. Needless to say, parent-child activities are the main focus of this hotel. There are so many. Bubble parties are highly recommended.
3. The decoration of the hotel is really beautiful, and the sunset bar is so beautiful
4. There is everything you need to eat, drink and play. The baby‚Äôs play area is also very large and there is also a small train.
5. Will you take the initiative to ask if you want a bubble bath? Will take the initiative to ask if you want hot ginger tea or good night milk for your baby
6. He also helped us bring our slippers to the swimming pool so we didn‚Äôt have to step on the hot ground.
7. Because we are Intercontinental members, we directly upgraded the room type, and the children loved the desserts provided. The fruits provided were all high-end, and none of them were delicious just for the sake of formality.
8. Because we checked out very early, the hotel thoughtfully prepared breakfast for us (breakfast was not included in our room)
Their hotel equipment is very new, there are several swimming pools, and the design of the hotel is very beautiful. I feel that it is not only a family hotel, but a hotel with excellent service that is suitable for all ages.

Regarding baby snacks, the hotel is really good at selecting them. Every item is the baby's favorite, and the little crab also likes it very much.

The overall feeling is great. I will stay here next time if I have a chance.

If you are bringing your children to Sanya, the reputation of Yanlord Crown‚Äôs parent-child ceiling is definitely not in vain.

This time when I came to Sanya, I stayed at the Westin first and then the Park Hyatt at Sunny Bay. Compared with Yanlord, the service is still far behind.

First of all, Avril, the housekeeper, communicated with me in advance the day before I was about to check in and asked me what my needs were. By the time I checked in, everything was put in place. What activities are there every day? What are the children‚Äôs needs? How are they resting? As long as you stay in this hotel, you will always feel Having someone by your side makes you feel very at ease. This level of detail and thoughtfulness is something you can‚Äôt experience in other hotels. Thank you Avril for upgrading the room and giving gifts to the children when you checked outüéÅ I believe you will do it again in the future. Continue to choose Yanlord Crown

I chose Yanlord after debating for a long time, and it really didn't disappoint at all. Except for the breakfast, which could be richer, the rest of the services are not to mention, and children's activities are fully arranged from morning to night. May, the experience ambassador, also answered all questions and was very considerate. In the end, I originally wanted to extend my stay but had no choice but to have no room. I will most likely choose this place next time I bring my children.

She answered all our questions, gave thoughtful greetings and provided surrounding information. The temperature in Sanya has cooled down in the past two days, and brown sugar ginger tea was served to us as soon as we checked in, which was very heartwarming. The Bvlgari shampoo and fruit plate provided in the room are also exquisite. It‚Äôs even more fun for children, with little crab dolls, daily mini bars, and good night milk. When I returned to the room after dinner, Kily had arranged a flower petal bubble bath for the children. What a surprise! The hotel's parent-child activities are even more colorful, and are fully booked every day. From early morning fun to playing, the children have gained a lot. It also gives adults time to slow down and enjoy a leisurely vacation. The pleasant 3-night trip ended quickly, and I was reluctant to leave. Yanlord is indeed the ceiling of a family hotel, and I look forward to coming back next time! Once again, praise and thank our beauty ambassador Kily!

msg:Just in time for my child's 3rd birthday, I came to Hainan for a long time to choose a hotel. I compared many hotels and finally decided to stay at Yanlord for 3 days and then Tianyu for 6 days.
advantage:
1. Yanlord's service is very good, reaching out to every employee. The butler May will take the initiative to ask for needs every day and respond to all requests. This is a butler service experience that I have never had in other five-star hotels.
2. The breakfast in the restaurant has many types and is very high-end. The butter peanut butter sandwich is delicious. The beef noodles are all large pieces of beef. The juice is fried on site. The coffee is so good that they even let you take it away.
3. Let‚Äôs talk about details. The beach is no longer under the management of the hotel. There is actually a lifeguard from Yanlord who is always guarding there.
4. Beach toys are provided free of charge. There is a pavilion at the beach where Yanlord employees provide sunscreen and bath towels.
5. When I go to the takeout court to pick up takeout, the hotel lobby sends a car to take it there every time.
6. The overall quality of customers is relatively high

Disadvantages: It's just expensive. There's nothing wrong with it except that it's expensive. If you have children 3 years old or younger, you won't regret it if you close your eyes.

The hotel service experience ambassadors are attentive and responsive, handle problems in the hotel in a timely manner, and provide prompt follow-up and feedback. This hotel is definitely worth recommending in terms of service!

msg:A family hotel with high quality and attention to detail.
Before check-in, Avril, the hotel's Crown Experience Ambassador, called and asked about any personal requirements for the stay. She also added a WeChat message and sent the hotel's parent-child activity schedule, and told her to contact her for anything during the stay.

Since we were coming from nearby Atlantis, we thought it wasn‚Äôt far, so we just walked over with our luggage. When we arrived at the hotel entrance, the doorman saw us dragging our luggage and immediately enthusiastically called for a battery cart to take us to the lobby.

As soon as we arrived at the hotel door, there was a concierge staff who helped us unload our luggage and told us that it would be delivered directly to the room after we checked in, so we didn't need to move it ourselves.

Then we went to the front desk to go through the formalities, and a beautiful staff member put a beautiful welcome wreath on each of us, which was really full of ceremony. At this time Avril also came to deliver the hotel‚Äôs privilege card and paper children‚Äôs activity schedule.

Children's activities fill the whole day from morning to night, and they are all interesting and not boring. The most fun thing is the family bubble show every afternoon, the children go crazy.

The hotel rooms are spacious and comfortable, with an artistic decoration style and full of details. There is a set of Bvlgari personal care products given to guests in the room, and sunscreen, mouthwash, toilet water, and laundry detergent have all been considered. The toilet and bathtub are equipped with disposable toilet mats and bathtub covers, which are full of details. There is a large outdoor terrace facing Haitang Bay, with an eye-catching view.

The guest rooms are cleaned frequently every day, and fruit plates are delivered in the afternoon and the trash is picked up. The fruit plate is by no means a perfunctory one. There are a wide variety of fruits, all of which are local tropical fruits.

The hotel has multiple swimming pools, the children's pool and the sky pool on the 15th floor are constant temperature. The skyline swimming pool is definitely a place that must be checked in. It seems to be connected to the sea. The beach is also very close, and hotel staff provide bottled water, blankets and sand digging tools for children at the beach entrance.

The Atlantis we stayed at before is known as the ceiling of a family hotel in Sanya, but after actually staying at both, I think the Crowne Plaza is obviously better and is a good choice for a leisurely vacation at home.

msg:As the ceiling of Yanlord Crown is a family hotel, it is a good place to walk your kids. Free use of minibar in room. On the day of check-in, guests will receive a Bvlgari gift box and a small fruit crab doll as a turn-down gift. Now there is a joint event between the hotel and the duty-free shop. You can enjoy 15-95% off at the duty-free shop. There is also an airport drop-off service every day, and you need to make an appoin**ent in advance. I made a reservation through Ctrip, which also provided free travel photography, with 10 photos to choose from. I have to praise the travel photos here, they are so beautiful!
The hotel butler service is very good. Emily is really an excellent housekeeper! Customer issues can be dealt with in a timely manner and she is attentive and considerate. Call her like crazy! On the day of check-in, because I felt a little uncomfortable after getting out of the swimming pool, she also arranged for a doctor to come to the room to check on me and give me medication suggestions. This is really beyond my imagination. It feels very safe and secure when taking the baby out. Because she liked the little milk coconuts here, she also gave two small milk coconuts as gifts.
As a parent-child hotel, the activities for children are very colorful. Adults can free their hands and shop and play with peace of mind. There are heated swimming pools, water parks, parent-child activities, etc. The children had a great time and kept praising the hotel I chose for being so fun.
The breakfast at the Crown Hotel is really rich, and each area is clearly divided. There are egg pancakes, coconut milk coffee, Hou'an noodles, etc., which are all very unique. For dishes like those with hot noodles, the waiter will help deliver the food.
Overall, I am very satisfied with my stay. Every year when I come to Sanya, I will definitely stay at Yanlord Crown for two days.

msg:The housekeeper Kily is very conscientious and responsible, and is very welcoming. The hotel rooms are also good. You can add a small tent and take a bubble bath. However, Haitang Bay is really windy and not suitable for swimming. You can only go to the infinity heated swimming pool on the 15th floor. In addition, I feel that the hotel is not suitable for outdoor play. The project is smaller than Tianyu and the rooms are much better than At. If you come to Haitang Bay many times for parent-child projects every day, you will still choose Yanlord.

The moment we entered the hotel, we felt very comfortable and relaxed. Fruits were provided on the first day of check-in, and drinks and snacks were replenished every day. We just happened to meet each other. It was my birthday right away, and they arranged a birthday cake for me and decorated the bed. They really paid attention to the guests' feelings and tried their best to satisfy them. There are many varieties of buffet breakfast, and many of them are cooked to order, and some of them can be DIYed by yourself, such as Qingbu Liang, which my mother and I both like very much! Breakfast will not be taken away until 11 o'clock, and you will have enough time to sleep until you wake up naturally and then eat. The sand at the beach is also very fine. Every day when the sun is not shining, the children are digging and digging. If they don‚Äôt want to dig, they go swimming and playing games. They have a very fulfilling life. There are many hotel activities to participate in, and the children have fun every day. It automatically shut down when there was no battery. I was so happy that I was allowed to stay another night. On the night of my extended stay, I had dinner at the hotel, Caifeng Building. I ordered a set meal and when I was sitting in the seating outside, the lady warned me that there might be mosquito bites outside, but I didn‚Äôt pay attention, and then I got bitten a few times. , I bothered the little brother and sister and moved it indoors. The food tasted good. Anna, the supervisor, and Fay, the receptionist at the door, were very nice. They gave the child five small coconuts on the day he left. The child was super happy! Oh, also, when I left, I was in a hurry and forgot to tell Ambassador May. May even specifically asked for my address and sent me a small gift. There are so many things I want to write, but the number of words is limited. Come next time If I still stay here in Sanya, I really want to praise it infinitely! As a result, the MGM hotel I stayed at later was really...

There are plenty of children's activities throughout the day, and the playground is well-equipped. It should be said to be very friendly to babies under 6 years old. The variety of breakfast meals suitable for babies is very comprehensive, nutritious and healthy, and the fruits are at room temperature. It is highly recommended to families with younger babies.
            In particular, the beautiful housekeeper Stacey is the most responsible person I have ever encountered when staying at high-end hotels and B&Bs in Endo. She has a strong sense of public relations. When problems arise during the stay, she uses Haidilao-style professional services to resolve them in a timely manner. Many problems I was impressed by the details of the personalized service. They never forgot to provide me with various travel information during my vacation. Knowing that the child was sick, he asked the guest room to send ginger and jujube tea. Generally speaking, in just a few days, the whole family is very satisfied. The children are very happy and miss school. I have stocked up on room vouchers and look forward to my next stay.

First of all, I felt the care from the hotel before I checked in. The housekeeper Kily (Xiao Zeng) called me one day in advance to discuss the check-in related matters. She asked all my needs in detail, and almost all my requests were answered. Later, I added WeChat and sent me instructions for booking children‚Äôs activities in advance.
When we checked in the next day, we wanted our children to play early, so we arrived very early. Xiao Zeng took us through the check-in procedures in advance and asked the children to go to the park to participate in activities. At noon, we went to the duty-free shop for dinner, and the hotel called me to inform me. My room has been tidied up and I can get my room card. Xiao Zeng upgraded me to a supreme sea view room, located at the bow of the ship, in the direction of Atlantis, with an unparalleled sea view. The children were given small crab dolls, Bvlgari toiletry sets, welcome fruits, check-in garlands, small tents, building blocks, and minibar drinks and food. I also gave my child goodnight milk in the evening. On the first day I checked in, I felt the warmth from all over the hotel. There will also be a Chris**as light-lighting ceremony that evening, and there are a lot of activities for the children. Soft drinks and cakes will be provided for free that night. The entire hotel has Baisui Mountain mineral water available anytime and anywhere. Every staff member is greeted with a smile. The children participated in many activities, which were very rich, hands-on, brain-using, interactive, and even made beautiful little braids. The staff are all very nice to the children.
The hotel has an outdoor heated swimming pool for children and an infinity pool on the 15th floor that is also heated. This is very kid friendly! The next day was my birthday, and what particularly touched me was that the hotel arranged a birthday decoration for me and gave me a birthday cake and snacks. Extremely warm. The cleaning is also very timely and clean. They also gave us a bubble bath in the bathtub in advance. Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Zeng. During my stay, he took the initiative to communicate with me from morning to night, and sent me notices on how to eat, how to participate in children's activities, etc. My questions were answered and resolved in a timely manner. If there is any shortcoming, it is that there are too many people at breakfast, but this also shows that there are many people staying. Our whole family is very satisfied with this trip to Yanlord and wishes the hotel better and better!

I did my homework online without knowing anything about it and saw Yanlord, which is known as the ceiling of a family hotel. Crown Hotel. The day before my trip, Jayden, the hotel‚Äôs experience ambassador, contacted me on WeChat and briefly introduced the hotel to me and asked about the check-in staff and check-in requirements. Keep an eye on our itinerary along the way. They also helped us upgrade our room for free and arranged it on a higher floor. The hotel environment is really beautiful. It is less than ten minutes away from Sanya International Duty Free City by taxi. You can also take a bus there. All rooms in the hotel can see the sea, and the room we stayed in can see Atlantis. The fireworks show on Saturday night was really beautiful. The hotel provides sink pedals, baby bathtubs, and baby toilet seats for children. The minibar is free and refilled every day, the breakfast is rich in variety, and milk is provided to the children every night. It really shows the care for the children. There is also a travel photography service in each room, and You can participate in various parent-child activities. The hotel is only a five-minute walk from the beach. It also thoughtfully provides various beach toys and clean towels for the children. It is really thoughtful.
We stayed for four days and three nights this time and felt that the children's entertainment facilities in the hotel were not enough. The children could have fun without going out at all.
The most unforgettable thing about this trip was that on the third day of my stay, my baby had a fever. I borrowed a thermometer from the front desk staff, and then Jayden asked about the situation on WeChat and called a doctor. Although I am a medical worker myself, I couldn‚Äôt go out. It‚Äôs also very frustrating when my children are sick outside. It also makes me feel at ease to have a doctor come over. Then they brought freshly stewed rock sugar pear to the child, and thoughtfully prepared porridge for the baby in the evening...
Even though my child was sick, this trip will be the best vacation I have ever experienced!

The hotel service is also very good and responsive to all requests. One time, a child's nail was split and he called room service. Nail clippers were delivered shortly, solving an urgent need. You can also get game coins by participating in the activities and use them to play the game consoles, which makes the children have a lot of fun. There is free water and big warm bath towels at both the beach and the pool, which is really great. You can also pack a little bit of the buffet breakfast for your children to take home.

After I went there, I felt that I chose Yanlord very wisely. Thank you to my housekeeper. Jayden, in the past few days, we have been asking what services we need when we check in. We try our best to meet all our needs. Especially when I checked in just two days after my birthday, they thoughtfully provided me with birthday decorations and cakes. It was great and touching. Let me talk about other things in the hotel. , when we got off the car, there was a waiter who helped us with our luggage and gave us garlands. The check-in was very fast and the view from the room was very good. Then we immediately sent it to play in the water. The hotel has many projects every day. My daughter was very happy and played. You can get bath towels everywhere (the bath towels here are warm and super warm when you come out of the water). In short, everything feels great. My daughter is even reluctant to leave and wants to stay in the hotel. I will still do it next time Choose Yanlord to play with your friends!

msg:1. The wind in the lobby is not very strong every day. This time I stayed for four days and five nights, and the weather was mostly good. It was very windy on the first day, but there was almost no wind in the next few days.
2. There are many types of breakfast. The Chinese food is various Hainan special snacks, and the Western food is more. There are also many things to attract children, such as various sweets. Each breakfast table will have a bib and a set of children's tableware. It is truly a family hotel. , 68 Food Street and Duty Free Shop Phase II are not far away, just a few minutes‚Äô taxi ride away
3. Check-in is indeed a bit slow because there are too many people, all of whom come with children. It turns out that there is no off-season for family hotels.
4. Before check-in, the housekeeper Jaden contacted me in advance and asked about my preferences and requirements. My proposal of seamlessly splicing twin beds facing the direction of Atlantis was met one by one. The scenery is very good. I was also upgraded to the supreme sea view and housekeeper every day. They always ask if you need anything, very considerate.
5. The room is very hygienic, there is no musty smell, it is cleaned every day, and I don‚Äôt see any sanitary dead spots.
6. You really don‚Äôt need to take anything when you bring your children. You can get whatever you want, as long as you are not particularly germaphobic.
7. There are three swimming pools in the hotel. The outdoor ones are not constant temperature. It is good to swim when the weather is hot. The one on the top floor is constant temperature. But don‚Äôt go too early because it takes time to heat up. It is best to go after ten o‚Äôclock. Babies especially like the swimming pool on the top floor. , because it‚Äôs so hot [laughing R], the bath towels are warm after I come out, which is good „Éæ(ÔΩè„Éªœâ„Éª)„Éé
9. There are quite a lot of parent-child activities, but my child is less than three years old, so I didn‚Äôt take her to participate. I only took her to swim, catch dolls and play with the naughty castle. The naughty castle is indeed small, and the Qilin Fantasy Land next to it is a larger playground. But in total, not many are suitable for babies. They are all for older children, mostly adventure games.
10. Finally, what everyone criticizes is that there are no deck chairs or parasols on the beach, and there is no place to sit.
Overall, it's really good

msg:This time I came to Sanya and chose Yanlord Crown in Haitang Bay because I wanted to try the legendary parent-child ceiling!
The housekeeper Diana added WeChat the day before check-in to learn about our check-in preferences and informed us of the baby supplies that can be provided. It was really complete and met our needs as much as possible. We upgraded the room! This is a place I feel good about!
On the day of check-in, when you arrive in the lobby, a staff member will wear a garland. To be honest, although this garland is a small thing, it feels very warm and subtly brings people into the feeling of vacation! Then my son accidentally fell into the pool while playing in the lobby bar and his clothes got wet. The housekeeper noticed it immediately and made corresponding arrangements! When I learned that my child needed milk powder, they directly sent me a box of Baisuishan. This is also very good. The water is not expensive, but I think the small details depend on the service!
During breakfast time, it can be seen that most of them are family trips. I personally care about the things my children use, so we brought our own tableware. As a result, I found that the tableware in the restaurant is also very good, so there is no need to bring it myself! There are also many parent-child activities every day. My baby is 2 years old. Although he cannot participate in some activities, the hotel has activities for younger children! The 270-degree infinity pool YYDS on the 15th floor has swimming rings for all ages, and you will be given warm towels after swimming!
In fact, at first I was a little worried that it would not be as good as online transmission, so I booked two nights first. After the experience, we renewed the room. It was a family vacation. The only thing we had to do was not leave the hotel to check out the attractions. The whole family Everyone is happy, this is really how I feel this time!
Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Diana. From adding me on WeChat the night before check-in to checking out today, she took great care of us, customer experience! ! ! From arranging the room to seeing the arranged snacks/fruits when you return to the room frequently, WeChat will remind you of special events in the hotel every day, such as Halloween these two days! The most important thing is that there will inevitably be some emergencies when going out, and Diana can handle them very promptly and effectively! Our baby had a fever and we immediately asked if we needed to arrange for a doctor and ginger water! Gave us a lot of invisible support! Although it is said that the housekeeper's job is to deal with guests' problems, I think Diana has provided more outstanding services. This is also a key point that our family is very satisfied with this stay!

msg:I stayed at the Crown for three nights this time. Because I was traveling with elders and children, I was quite tired, but I have to say that the service was really considerate. Miss Stacey took care of everything before and after my stay. From the moment I arrived to the moment I checked out, they provided all-round service, answered all my questions, and even celebrated my birthday thoughtfully. I was very touched, and it also left a deep memory for the elders and children who came to Sanya for the first time! I will often bring children and the elderly to Sanya in the future, and Crown will definitely be my first choiceü´∂üèªI also hope to meet Miss Stacey next time!

Environment: From the last hotel to Yanlord, I was impressed by the cheerful a**osphere at the front desk, and my colleagues in Tongtong also praised it repeatedly. The hotel is very friendly to children and very user-friendly

Service: I have to mention the hotel‚Äôs service. The butler Stacey is sincere, enthusiastic, careful and thoughtful! From arranging a room before entering the hotel to after checking in, she gave me fruit, red wine, milk, desserts, prepared a bubble bathüõÄ for me, and reminded me to cool down and keep warm at night. I really appreciate her! Next time I bring my kids to Sanya, I will definitely choose Yanlord again! Other hotel employees are also very friendly and smiling.

msg:A very satisfying stay or vacation. Thank you very much to Crown Experience Ambassador Stacey for your full service, it was great. The hotel is considerate in every aspect, especially suitable for family vacations. The family of three is very satisfied, especially after comparing it with the hotel in Xiaodonghai, they unanimously decided to stay at the Haitang Bay hotel and the Yanlord Crowne Plaza next time they come to Sanya. Let‚Äôs share some small details:
1. Before check-in, Stacey contacted in advance to inform some of the services provided by the hotel; during check-in, online services were provided throughout the process;
2. The hotel pick-up bus provides a sense of belonging;
3. Step into the hotel and receive a welcome wreath;
4. Upon check-in, you will receive a Bulgari bath gift box, a small crab doll, welcome fruit on the first day (the coconut water with the hotel logo is especially delicious), a daily minibar drink, and additional hotel snacks;
5. The room is equipped with a children's toiletry set, as well as brand-new mouthwash, sunscreen, laundry detergent, facial cleanser, toilet water; in particular, children's tents, building blocks, children's blankets, etc. are provided on demand; the hair dryer is from Dyson. ;
6. There are large towels, free mineral water, sunscreen and toilet water by the swimming pool; free beach toys, large towels and free mineral water are provided by the beach;
7. The hotel provides many rich activities for children, divided into 3-8 years old and 8-12 years old. The whole journey is OK without leaving the hotel. The girl experienced making fruit cakes, energy hamburgers, participated in water fights, bubble shows, There were activities such as pirate attacks, and there was also a children's club (the girls there all knew us). Unfortunately, we only went to the Fantasy Forest to participate in the activities on the last day, and only then did we know that the Fantasy Forest is also fun, and we didn't have enough fun;
9. The children's club provides disposable socks and free mineral water every time; the Fantasy Forest also provides disposable socks or non-slip socks, and children will wear helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads when playing climbing projects. , my little brother played with me the whole time;
10. The newly registered Intercontinental members were upgraded to a room on the 7th floor, close to Atlantis. The sea view is beautiful and the style of the room is my favorite. After playing the bubble show on the third day, I also prepared a bubble bath. The baby was really happy with the little surprise of taking a bath.

Finally, I would like to comment on the hotel's travel photography. It is very good. Free clothing and makeup are provided. The photographer Lsland did a good job. But because I have never been photogenic, I ended up choosing more than 20 photos (including 10 complimentary photos). If you exceed the number of free photos, you will be charged 20 yuan per photo. The most important thing is that when selecting photos, there will be no interference or promotion in the whole process (this is my feeling after comparing with the travel photography at Xiaodonghai Hotel).

The hotel housekeeper Diana took the initiative to contact and add WeChat the day before check-in. She enthusiastically introduced some of the hotel‚Äôs parent-child projects and the coordination of some check-in matters. She also upgraded the floor and room floor, and the scenery is amazing ~ The hotel's butler-style service makes your stay feel safe! Give the hotel a thumbs up! !
The hotel has a beautiful environment and the staff are very friendly. There are so many parent-child activities that we don‚Äôt have time to play. Another thing worth mentioning is that the beach contracted by the hotel has fine sand, which is better than the one on Wuzhizhou Island! The whole family was very satisfied with this trip. It would not be wrong to choose Yanlord when coming to Sanya! Thank you to the housekeeper Diana for giving us a happy holidayüíó

Before coming to Sanya, my head hurt when choosing a hotel. I found that no matter how good the hotel was, some people complained about it. I would like to say that there is nothing wrong with a hotel of this level, only whether it is suitable for you. Yanlord Crown in Sanya is indeed the benchmark for family hotels, and other services and management of the hotel are also very good. This is our first stay and I would like to express my gratitude to the beautiful lady Avril who hosted us. The off-season has its advantages. Avril carefully checked the system and helped us upgrade the room type to meet my needs for the room type. The subsequent care and services continued to keep up, so I immediately decided to stay another night. Thanks again Avril. After leaving the hotel, my wife and daughter kept thinking about going back to Yanlord Crown. I will choose here again next time I come to Sanya.

I like the travel photos I sent, and I am satisfied.
It's just that there are too many people for breakfast! The only one who didn't sleep well during the few days in Sanya was Yanlord Crown.
It's too hot to cover the quilt, so if you don't cover it, the children will catch a cold.
Kelly is great, thank you, hard work~
The small gift given by the children also like it~

All the amu*****t facilities in the hotel are free, and children's amu*****t machines and coins are distributed for free. Children like the children's pool downstairs, especially the infinity pool on the top floor, 270 degrees. The sea view is unbeatable. There is a buffet seafood barbecue on the top floor in the evening, with a rich variety. Jenny, the housekeeper, will send thoughtful WeChat greetings and service tips every day. All in all, the stay experience was very good, and it is worthy of being the first choice for family hotels in Haitang Bay.

The hardware of the hotel is already outstanding. Whether it is the swimming pool or breakfast, the travel photos provided by the hotel, or the beautiful scenery of the beach, they all make me linger. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic and responsive to all my requests. The guest rooms are also cleaned twice a day. When I go to the next hotel, I can still receive avril's care. If I can say goodbye to her face to face when I leave the hotel, it will make me feel that it will be more humane.

I am very happy to upgrade to the supreme sea view room for free at the store! It is very friendly to children. You can call customer service to apply for tents, children's toilet seats, children's booster stools, etc. Before check-in, there was a call from Gianna, the housekeeper, who asked about the age of the child very carefully, and arranged the bed for the child. She was very careful. On the second day of check-in, the butler brought a dessert platter for the child, and the child was very happy! In addition, Yanlord Crown's bubble event is very well designed, the time is right, and the place is right. At 17:30, there was no sunshine in the children's pool, and the children had a great time. Two consecutive activities are in the same place, so you don't need to change places to run to find activities. It's really fun. There are also specialized personnel on the beach, who can get sand digging tools for free, and return clean bath towels for hotel guests when they come back, which is really very responsible! This is something that the other two hotels in Haitang Bay do not have. Other beaches do not have these services. In addition, the activities are free, and the children are brought to make various snacks, and teachers will explain them specially. All in all, it's a perfect family! Will stay in Haitang Bay in the future!

The hotel's Green Travel Photography provides a one-stop service for Fuhuadao, taking refined photos of lawns, coconut groves, and seascapes. Recommendations for photo-realistic photos are needed. The beach in Haitang Bay is very delicate and clean. Apart from not being able to enter the water, there are many others for playing with sand and treading water. If you have quality requirements for hotels and beaches, please come to Haitang Bay. Let me talk about the unsatisfactory aspects. When I went there, it caught up with the wind, and the lobby was very windy. Ctrip's free upgrade to the Supreme Sea View Room is on the side of Khao San. When the balcony door is opened, there is a strong convective wind when opening and closing the door. Afraid of bumping into people. In addition, when the front desk checked in, although they understood their busyness, the whole process was serious and blunt, which affected the vacation mood and doubted the service quality of the hotel.

msg:For the Nth trip to Sanya, I struggled for a long time and finally decided to live in Yanlord Crowne Plaza, and I was not disappointed! The day before check-in, I received a greeting call from Crown Experience Ambassador Lena, who upgraded the room type for free and informed us of the time we wanted to check in earlier. Sure enough, I arrived at the hotel after 12 o'clock the next day and got the room, very satisfied! During the entire stay, there was Lena's warm company, booking travel photography, buffet dinner, airport drop-off service, all done by WeChat at any time, convenient and efficient experience! The hotel's breakfast is too rich and delicious! The environment quality of the sea view buffet on the 15th floor is very good! All in all, no matter the hardware or software, I am very satisfied!

msg:Yanlord Crown has a very good stay experience, and there is a reason why it is expensive. The housekeeper, Melody Chen, was very caring. He contacted me by phone one day in advance and arranged for an upgraded room type. He was also very warm and thoughtful after check-in. Even if the old man felt unwell halfway through, he arranged for a doctor to come into the room for consultation in time. He gave afternoon tea as a gift, and he came to see him off when he left. There is nothing to say about the whole service. I haven't stayed in other hotels in Haitang Bay, but this is basically the ceiling. Suitable for bringing children, all kinds of activities and amu*****ts are very suitable for children under ten years old. The infinity pool on the 15th floor is amazing, and the garden pool on the 1st floor is also beautiful. Super close to the sea. I don't want to go home. This is highly recommended if conditions permit. Thank you also to melody for your caring care, which made us have a good impression of Sanya.

Because the lumbar spine of our fellow traveler can't sleep on a mattress that is too soft, he turned the mattress over for us, which is not too considerate. After arriving at the store, various arrangements are made, and you feel at home. The hotel sent another travel photo, ten photos for free. Snacks are added to the snack bar once a day for free, soft drinks and water are free, which is very friendly to parents who want to make tea when they go out. The breakfast is also very delicious, combining Chinese and Western styles, with many varieties. There are even marshmallows, too cozy for the baby family.

The family members are all boasting that Yanlord Crown has become the catchphrase of the dolls! The breakfast is really invincible and rich, and the parent-child activities are seamlessly connected every day, such as colorful biscuit towers, delicious sandwiches, coconut leaves, and variety twisting sticks... You can also exchange game coins for participating in the event stamps. The butler, Lena, sent SMS greetings and warm reminders every day from check-in to check-out. She was super considerate and really comprehensive. She introduced hotel activities, shuttle bus reservations, duty-free shop activities, etc. in great detail.
Facilities: There is a big bathtub in the room, and the hair dryer is from Dyson. Bulgari will be given away when you check in, because there are three children staying, and a 2.4 king-size bed is not crowded at all.
Hygiene: The hotel even took the initiative to clean our room twice on the same day without our request. It may be because there are too many children and the room is too messy, but this small gesture really warmed me up.
Environment: It's super close to the beach, with a large coconut grove in the middle, which is super popular. You can also get free sand-digging toys when you go to the beach. You can see the sea from the balcony of the room, and the location of Haitang Bay is excellent!

msg:It is said that Yanlord Crown is the ceiling of parent-child hotels. I have stayed in most hotels in Sanya from Yalong Bay to Haitang Bay, so we chose to stay at Yanlord Crown Hotel directly during our 6-day visit to Sanya. The day before we were about to leave for Sanya, Katie, the hotel‚Äôs Crown experience ambassador, took the initiative to call me and asked me if I had any special requirements for the hotel room, what time I would arrive at the hotel, and made arrangements and preparations for us in advance. After arriving at the hotel, Katie helped me arrange the room, and checked in directly after the check-in procedure. Katie will arrange for anything you need during this hotel. All the hotel toiletries are from Bulgari. In addition, the hotel gave us a box of perfume on the first day of our stay, which is very surprising. During these 6 days, the children's activities in person are uninterrupted from the morning until 6 o'clock in the evening. There are activities in every time period, and the activities are different every day. It can be seen that the hotel has carefully planned each activity. It is really good, especially the drama. The whole drama lasts for about an hour, and the children are very happy. I like it, the content of the program is very good, and the children have a great time playing here. The VIP lounge of the hotel is really good. I have stayed in so many hotels in Sanya, but Yanlord's VIP lounge is the best. From breakfast in the morning until 20 o'clock in the evening, Starbucks coffee is served all day long, until 17:30 in the afternoon There are light meals at 20 o'clock, which is very suitable for children. In addition, the hotel is cleaned at least twice a day. For those who bring children to play, the hotel does a good job of cleaning the room twice a day. The room manager saw that we brought our children and arranged for us their favorite bubbles. bath. We also gave us a late check-out on the last day. During the 6 days in Yanlord, I personally experienced that the service of Yanlord Crown is really good, very caring and careful, worthy of the ceiling of a parent-child hotel. If you come to Sanya to bring your children to play, you must choose Yanlord Crown. Finally, special praise to Katie for her excellent service and responsiveness! Next time I come back, I will definitely choose to stay at Yanlord Crown!

The hotel's breakfast is super rich, and all kinds of special delicacies can fully meet the dining needs of adults and children. It is really pleasant to eat breakfast and look at the scenery outside. The hotel's beach provides many children's sand digging tools, hot towels, and mineral water. Children have a great time playing on the beach. During the check-in, Chris, the housekeeper brother, also thoughtfully asked about the experience of the stay, and promptly helped to arrange it if needed. Although I only stayed at Yanlord for two nights this time, the experience was very good, and the staff were very enthusiastic. I hope to have the opportunity to come again in the future Bring your kids to Yanheng~

It is worthy of being a legendary parent-child hotel. The service and details are all in place. I have thought of everything that should be thought of. ps: My baby likes the water in her house very much, and I drink a lot of water. Before leaving the hotel, I came to ask for any suggestions for improvement. Except for the price and the large number of people, I don‚Äôt think there are any suggestions.

Wechat communication before check-in has always been in charge of reception, meal arrangements and children's activity reservations are very caring. Special praise to Stacey, who has been asking us about our needs and is very attentive.
Renheng's guests are basically parents and children. The room is very spacious, and finally I don't have to share a bed with me, and I slept soundly for three nights. The bathroom is designed with dry and wet separation, and flip flops, children's umbrellas, and children's indoor slippers are specially prepared. There are also sand dredging tools for public use at the entrance to the beach. It can be said that everything is meticulous.
In terms of catering, we ate Caifenglou and meal delivery service. Caifenglou is of a high standard, the pigeon is tender and juicy, and the rice with lobster is delicious. The pizza and pasta delivered are the same as those made in Italian restaurants, and the seafood in Malay Fried Guitiaoli is also very new and tastes first-class.
There are not too many coffee shops in Hainan, and there is a Starbucks in the hotel, which is very good. The coffee in the breakfast room of the Yalong Bay Hotel where I stayed before was really bad. The staff in the coffee depar**ent of Yanlord Breakfast Room are very nice. I ordered a cup of coffee made by the coffee machine in the bar, and he would deliver it to our table after he finished it. I would like to praise him.
The only thing that needs to be improved is the problem of flies in the bread area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe breakfast room. On two mornings, flies were seen flying. Everything else is fine, and the restaurant staff are working hard in their respective positions.

The sea breeze blows gently, and the scenery in front of you is picturesque, which feels very beautiful! The swimming pool is clean and shaded, and the rooftop swimming pool has an infinite view! The breakfast is rich, and the 270-degree restaurant buffet dinner and sea view are perfect! And the service is very attentive, the management is orderly, not crowded and noisy! The Chinese food in Caifenglou is not so good. The room is clean and comfortable, and the details are perfect! The housekeeper is kind and thoughtful. In short, the few days in Yanlord Crown are very comfortable and comfortable, it is worth coming again! highly recommended!

msg:I am very grateful to the housekeeper Lena for her meticulous care and company. Although I only checked in on 7/4, and I have already prepared for the extended check-in time during the peak summer season, the thoughtful Lena added WeChat on 7/3. Let us rest assured that we will be able to Check in on time. Not only did I check in early on the day, but I also upgraded the room type for free. The minibar in the room is replenished with drinks and snacks for free every day, and the housekeeper also prepared exquisite snacks. These details make the children very happy, and they will stay in Yanlord in the future. In addition, there are indeed too many children's activities. The two children had a great time playing. When the sun is strong during the day, indoor activities such as children's clubs and small chef's kitchens are arranged. In the afternoon, there are bubble shows, water gun fights, and swimming pool games. The whole day goes on and on, and the children don‚Äôt have time to look at their phones. It‚Äôs great! Participated in the event, there are game coins, you can play hotel game consoles, the children are very active and very happy. The breakfast variety is complete and rich, wontons and noodles are very suitable for children. Mango, papaya, red dragon fruit, adults also like it very much, and the fruits and vegetables are all nutritious. I'm too full to eat, but I can't miss a cup of coffee every day. The restaurant thoughtfully packed me a cup of latte, which doubled the strength of the coffee~ The service is really great! Hainan Hou'an powder is made on-site, registered and delivered to the dining table. The toilet cover, bathtub cover, sunscreen, and children's shower gel set in the room are replenished every day. Every time you go to an event location, there is bottled water, you can drink it anytime, anywhere, and you don‚Äôt have to take it out of the room yourself, saving effort and worry. There is nothing bad about it. If I come to Sanya next time, I don't want to change hotels. I just want to stay at Yanlord. Also, I forgot to take away my kickboard and clothes hanger, Lena helped me find it, and sent it back to Shanghai for free. It seems that the fate with Renheng is endless! Come back later! If I write a travel guide seriously, I can write a thousand words in the hotel alone, so let‚Äôs experience it yourself. If you are lucky, you may even meet the considerate and lovely butler Lena~

msg:Yanlord is the first hotel I stayed in during this trip to Sanya. The experience is very good. It is very suitable for parent-child travel. There are many activities for children. The hotel took the initiative to help us upgrade to a deluxe sea view room. The room is large, the sea view is pleasant, the facilities are new, and the supplies are complete, including various supplies for children (toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, shower gel, slippers, etc.). The buffet breakfast is rich, and the seafood buffet dinner on the 15th floor is also worth a try. Mineral water is available everywhere in the hotel. Next to each swimming pool, there are hot towels, sunscreen, toilet water, mineral water for self-service at any time, and swimming rings for children. Our service butler, Chris, has a very good service. He contacted and added WeChat before check-in, asked us about our needs in advance, helped to arrange travel photography, and helped with late check-out on the last day.
Haitang Bay is very windy and cannot go into the sea, but it is still possible to play with sand on the beach. The hotel provides free sand play tools.
Recommended for family trips!

The hotel upgraded the room type for free, and changed the double king size bed according to my request. The hotel facilities are very thoughtful, the air conditioner in the room is comfortable, the breakfast is full, the key taste is amazing, the toiletries provided for the children in the room are especially liked by the children, and they always say that the toothbrush of the mother can be ****** on the countertop, the toothpaste is not spicy, and the pillow is pressed You can change the buckwheat one, the one that sleeps on the back, the one that sleeps on the side. It is considerate, and there are gift boxes and fruits as well. Snacks are satisfying for both adults and children. My favorite is the Dyson hair dryer, and my husband likes beer the most. The key is that children's activities are non-stop, and the baby is very happy. Travel photography also recommends his home, and there is a free aerial photo. Toys are provided for pool and beach play, as well as mineral water and sunscreen, everything is high-end. Awesome, not a bit better than Atlantis, regardless of service or facilities. The housekeeper, Nancy, is so heart-warming, everything is arranged for me in advance. You must look for her, you will not be disappointed.

Pua, I said that the original room type was facing the Edison, and I was upgraded to a room type facing Atlantis. Floor 326 is the shortest and the farthest from the sea, with only a glimpse of the sea. The lights in room 326 are relatively dark, and it doesn't feel very good to live in. It's not the peak season yet, so there are so many people at the breakfast buffet. If you go late, you have to arrange a seat at the entrance of the restaurant. The only thing I am satisfied with is the service of the butler, who can answer my questions in a timely manner. Oh, by the way, Yanheng does not have a rest room! For staying, Haitang Bay is the best version of Edison.

msg:It's the first time I stayed at Yanlord Crown, and I read a lot of reviews before, with mixed reviews. Actually staying during the Dragon Boat Festival this time, I feel that the value for money is excellent, and I am very satisfied. Of course, hotel facilities and parent-child activities are very attractive to children. I think the special plus point is stacey, the housekeeper in our room! I contacted me the day before check-in to understand various matters, and the arrangements were made properly on the day of check-in! Really feel like coming home. There are so many people in the Dragon Boat Festival, check-in is very smooth, the room is also very satisfactory, the scenery is beautiful, all thanks to the housekeeper's careful arrangements in advance. With such a good butler service, what I regret most about my visit to Sanya this time is that I only stayed here for two days, which caused a gap in comparison with other hotels in Yalong Bay. I will definitely choose Yanlord Crown again in the future.

From the housekeeper to the service staff, they are basically always on call and provide you with whatever you need. A box of mineral water is given for free, and milk is delivered every day. The best ones are really good. The only shortcoming is that compared to Yate, there are insufficient places to kill time and facilities. Yate has the aquarium, water world and optional hotels in the commercial street. Yanlord has good service. I stayed at the Park Hyatt today. It has an exclusive bay. The few people and the scenery are not as good as the first two, and they cannot match the so-called luxury level.

I have been looking forward to it for a long time, and I was not disappointed or even exceeded my expectations when I arrived! After check-in, Emily introduced the layout of the hotel and parent-child activities in detail. Since her daughter was too young to participate in many activities, Emily directly helped arrange travel photography, and was considerate and thoughtful! The small problems encountered later were also quickly resolved, and the efficiency was extremely high! The most pleasant surprise was the upgrade to a 150-square-meter family sea view suite, a super-large room, three balconies, and a variety of children's toys. It's really not too exciting, and my daughter had a great time running around in the room! The room is so big, I wonder how the service staff clean it spotlessly, and there is a full minibar every day, so happy to fly! The hotel breakfast, I didn't eat all of it for three days, how rich it is, haha! Finally, I would like to thank Emily and all the staff for their super five-star service. I will stay at Yanlord next time I come to Haitang Bay!

The view from the room is superb, and all kinds of supporting facilities are fully equipped. You don‚Äôt have to worry about it. If you need to add a phone call or WeChat, the staff responds quickly to your needs (this is very impressive). From the front desk to the lifeguards at the pool, they all feel the super nice six-star extreme Serve. There are a lot of children's activities in the hotel. You only need to send a message to the housekeeper for the items that need to be reserved. The activities in the children's kitchen are very special. The children are very happy no matter whether they are in the room, the restaurant or the swimming pool. Before leaving, they are already thinking about their next visit When the room was renewed on the second day, Avril arranged a hotel snack for the child and gave us a little surprise. The only regret is that it is a little far away from the beach. I hope to add some activities for children over 5 years old and their parents to play at sea. When checking out, Avril prepared commemorative dolls for the children, which was really a beautiful and unforgettable memory.

I brought my 3-year-old baby on vacation alone‚õ±Ô∏è The day before check-in, there will be an exclusive customer service call and add WeChat to inquire about your needs. Here, I would like to thank my exclusive customer service, Ms. Melody, who is beautiful and kind, and takes care of my needs. And questions, all requests are answered, and all questions are answered.
The child had a fever on the third day, and Melody arranged for a doctor to come to see her. She also thanked Dr. Nina for her concern and care.

The room is big and spacious, the sea view from the balcony is invincible.
The hotel has an airport shuttle, very convenient to the airport, 50 minutes.
Children's activities are even more dazzling, never boring! You can walk to Fengtang Road nearby, and the street is full of seafood snacks, which is very good. But for children, the road is a bit long, and it takes nearly half an hour to walk. You can take a taxi, or come out of the hotel and rent a battery car.
The travel photography service is pretty good. The cafeteria and infinity pool on the 15th floor are very popular, so be sure to check in.
We had a happy 4 days, and there are still unused game coins, and we will definitely come again next time, hehe.

The overall boat-shaped design of the hotel building is very characteristic. What I like very much is that the open lobby and the double-height atrium are used to introduce natural ventilation into the building. When you open the door, you can feel the sea breeze blowing in your face, which is very comfortable. Before check-in, I was upgraded to a deluxe sea view room. The room and balcony are large, and the view from the balcony is very good. It is recommended to live on the side of Atlantis. The other side is very close to the Edison and may be blocked. The child is in the birthday month. The hotel made birthday arrangements and presented a cake. The hotel's children's activities are the most satisfying point. There are activities available from 9:30 in the morning to 8:00 in the evening. There are no repeats every day, and the children have fun. The night before leaving the store, Avril, the housekeeper, applied for desserts for the children. They were very considerate and the staff were great.

Traveling with a two-year-old baby, Avril, the housekeeper of the hotel, actively contacted us to ask if we need to add baby supplies before we checked in. We asked for a baby bathtub and building blocks. There are welcome fruits and Bulgari suits when you check in, and the snacks and drinks in the refrigerator are replenished every day. There is also sunscreen, laundry detergent, baby toiletries and toothbrushes. The little crab toy presented is very cute.

Dining at the baby restaurant on the first floor, there is a special baby set meal, which is very worry-free, and there are cartoons to watch. The public area outside the restaurant is a row of claw machines + video games. Stickers are the best to grab, and babies love them too. I also caught four dolls and gave one to other babies^œâ^ There are many kinds of breakfast, and I like pancakes and fried chicken steaks the most. Babies like to take the small train the most. You can ask the service staff to queue up and report the room number to sit. The beach has free sand digging tools, towels, mineral water and sunscreen, which is very convenient.

Our butler, Avril, responded to our requests in a timely manner, with thoughtful service, a warm attitude, and very satisfied.

In addition, the hotel also has a 95% discount at the duty-free shop, which can be used the next day if you make an appoin**ent in advance, and you can also reserve a pick-up and drop-off car and a car to the duty-free shop.

The arranged room has a high floor and a good view
The room service is excellent. When we come in and out of the room, we will greet each other and ask if cleaning is needed.
Two days after check-in, I happened to meet Kily taking a rest, and promptly replied to the message
After checking out, I also sent a WeChat message asking if I got home safely

First of all, I personally prefer the room type, the sea view room. Although I also live in the private pool of the villa, it is very quiet at night. I dare not open the door, there are too many mosquitoes, most of Yanlord is suitable for young babies, my baby is 3 and a half years old, and he is playing except for sleeping Toys, small tents, building blocks, and heightening boards. The child‚Äôs swimming ring fell off the next day. Joy also contacted me in time to find it and send it back to the room. There were some small episodes in the middle. I was on the balcony, and I didn‚Äôt hear the room cleaning and knocking on the door. , I just came in directly. Afterwards, the Duke manager actively contacted and communicated with us, and helped us deal with it. We were all satisfied with the result. I would like to give him a thumbs up hereüëç.

msg:I booked for four days and three nights. I brought my 3-year-old baby with my mother. I came here with trepidation. The comments on Renheng on the Internet were mixed, and I wanted to leave for several moments. Before coming to Sanya One day, the hotel staff called to inquire about the arrival time, and some staff members added WeChat. Joy was really considerate. He asked a few people in advance if there were any children who needed fences, small tents, building blocks and other children's products. The staff at the entrance of the hotel will open the door when getting on and off the car. There will be a welcome wreath when you enter the store. I booked a superior sea view room. When I checked in, I was told to upgrade to a deluxe sea view room. It was really a surprise. There are welcome fruits in the room, as well as a small crab doll and a Bulgari toiletry set. There are also daily replenishment of drinks and snacks. Dessert and ginger tea were also given during the stay. There are also many children's facilities on the first floor. My children are a little too young to play. The 10 travel photos presented by the hotel are also very good. An additional one is 20, and the aerial photography is also very good. It may be because Haitang Bay is relatively close to the sea, so the wind will be a bit strong. Everything else is fine. It is indeed a parent-child top1 hotel. It is very suitable for bringing children. If it is the first time to bring children to Sanya, Yanlord is recommended.

Because I had children with me and sent me a list of special needs, I chose to add additional bed rails and footrests as well as small tents and building blocks. There are many optional items on the list. It feels very friendly to guests who need to bring children. Everything from a bottle warmer to a stroller is really complete. It solves the troubles of traveling and moving for mothers. It was quite late on the day of check-in. I entered the house and already turned down the bed. There was fruit and milk in the evening. We stayed for four nights. Melody followed up on check-in requests every day and changed my pillow to a more comfortable one. She even gave me a fruit plate in the middle. There were many activities in the hotel's children's entertainment facilities, one after another, even if I was there for two days. Children will not be bored at all. The room is cleaned twice a day, which is very necessary for a seaside hotel. After all, bath towels, towels, etc. are often washed and used. The breakfast buffet is updated every day, so even if you stay for a few more days, you can eat different food. Hainan specialty coffee is so delicious and mellow. It is recommended to try it. Children's tableware and bibs are prepared in the restaurant. Many foods are also specially prepared for children.

Dad is the most satisfied with the three hotels. The design of the hotel is very reasonable. There are many elevators on the first floor. Although there are many guests, it doesn't feel crowded at all. I was very satisfied with the travel photography, I didn‚Äôt want to choose any films, I just packed them and bought them all.

msg:The child started to remember things at the age of 3, and encountered the epidemic when he was just 3 years old. The damn mask finally passed, and it was the first time to take him out when he was 6 years old. Well, I think great hotels always surprise you in places you don't even notice. For example, Emily, the housekeeper, contacted us in advance the day before check-in to learn about the travelers and their preferences. Because we arrived at the store early, she helped us arrange cleaning and check-in in advance. I was not allowed to stay at a hotel in Yalong Bay at 4 p.m. the day before. Going in is a world of difference; for example, every time we go out and come back, the room has been tidied up, and then every time there will be some "traces", such as a plate of thoughtful snacks; sunscreen is prepared next to each ride , heated bath towels, drinking water, no longer need to carry a big water bottle for the child everywhere, and don‚Äôt have to worry about the child catching cold when getting up from the swimming pool; the staff is very friendly and basically responds to requests. When we left, the kid liked Captain Charles' mouthwash cup very much, so he insisted on asking Ms. Emily for it. She wanted to give it a try, and she readily agreed to give it to him. It was the first time I took my children out on a trip, and I was in a hurry when I left. It was also the time I took away the most things in history. After checking, Ms. Emily contacted me to ask for the address, and arranged for me to send it back. The child said that he would come to play with Emily's sister next time, and the father said that the wallet was under a lot of pressure! Finally, there is one shortcoming. It is located in Haitang Bay. Apart from dining at the hotel, there is indeed a lack of dining resources. Fortunately, the hotel has a rich breakfast. The flaws are not concealed, 5-star praise!

msg:There are many hotels in Sanya Haitang Bay, and most of them are good in terms of sea view and hotel facilities. Because I brought my children here, it was the first time I stayed at Yanlord Crowne Plaza to experience it, and the feeling was good. We must first like Suzy Zheng, the crown experience ambassador who received us. He added WeChat before check-in to understand the itinerary. The child sent snacks, and gave care and greetings after leaving the store, which reflects Suzy Zheng's professionalism and dedication, and also reflects the high level of Yanlord's service among Haitang Bay hotelsüëç! Another most obvious feature of the hotel is parent-child vacation. The facilities, supporting facilities and layout show this everywhere. It is a good place for walking children. In terms of service and parent-child, it can be called the ceiling of Sanya Haitang Bay Hotel, and it is recommended to stay.

The three adults and one child stayed in the parent-child suite and arranged an extra bed service. A delicious small cake was given on the birthday, and other needs were met. There is a large flow of people at breakfast, but the food and beverages can be replenished in time; the waiters in the executive lounge are kind and polite, and they will take the children to pick up food and juice, and help pack coffee. The free travel photography service exceeded expectations, free makeup and clothing, the photographer is very good at amusing children, and the film is also very good!

The housekeeper Nancy is very attentive and not too intrusive. Contact us one day in advance to ask when you will arrive at the hotel and what is available in the room Demand, on the day of check-in, our room was arranged on the 12th floor, looking at Atlantis, the scenery is very good, the balcony is huge, and the sofa and reclining chairs are very comfortable! Nancy helped us apply for VIP dim sum, super nice! Our return flight was late and we applied for an extended check-out. Yanlord Crown is very suitable for children aged three or four, and the children have a lot of fun! The hotel breakfast is good, very rich and changes every day, welcome fruit on the first day.

The only bad thing is that there is only one restaurant for breakfast, and there are too many people during the morning rush hour
The wonderful holiday is too short, next time I will stay for a few more days

Every day, the personal butler Suzy will send us notes, places to eat, and places to play, which is very convenient for people who are alone with their children. You no longer need to check your mobile guides every day, looking for them one by one.
It's just that the beach is too sunny, it would be nice to have more deck chairs and shade/umbrellas, maybe it's because the beach is so windy and waves so it's arranged on the steps?
There are also many steps on the way from the room to the beach and the swimming pool, which is very inconvenient for baby strollers, and it would be better to have a small slope.
Apart from these two points, I am very satisfied with the service, sanitation, facilities, especially catering.

Even in the off-season, children are like coming to Disneyland. All parent-child programs are free (this point must be reiterated, I later went to Yalong Bay St. Regis and everything is charged). When I checked in, the housekeeper July added you on WeChat. That night my son accidentally tripped and fell into the suitcase and his stomach was broken. I asked if there was a doctor, and the hotel immediately sent a nurse to treat it with iodine. No delay in taking a shower, which may be unmatched by other hotels.
We went to the beach to dig sand after breakfast every day. In February, it was very windy and the temperature was very low. The children had to wear jackets. The wind blowing from the swimming pool on the 15th floor was very cold, and the temperature in the water was constant. Later, we moved to Yalong Bay to see the wind. smaller. In fact, if you come to Sanya in mid-March, the weather will be more suitable.
The hotel‚Äôs parent-child project took the small train, and I didn‚Äôt play anything else, because Shanghai has it all, and Sanya is to enjoy the beach.
Travel photography is based in a hotel studio, 10 free photos cost more than 20 yuan a piece, the price is not expensive, there are clothes to borrow, and there are many people who take pictures, just pay attention to make up and make yourself, their level is not good.
I went to Tianlu in Edison for dinner. The environment is good, the service is good, and the taste is delicious. I recommend everyone to try it, and you can also feel the environment in Edison.

msg:I can only stay in this hotel with children. There is nothing to do with the elderly. The beach is not beautiful and a bit messy. Fortunately, I am happy to take pictures. I spent more than 1,000 yuan to take some pictures. For breakfast, I didn't eat the delicious beef noodles mentioned on the Internet, and other things can only be said to be at a normal level. The facilities are also ordinary, if it is not for children to play, it is not worth living.

msg:This time I stayed in a full sea view suite for three nights, 5664 yuan per night. I was very unhappy on the day of check-in! I drove to the entrance of the hotel lobby at around 3:00 pm. I was holding a one and a half-year-old child. My husband took four luggage out of the car and put them on the ground. There was no service staff to entertain us! I walked to the service desk with my child in my arms and asked the service staff if they could help push a luggage cart? Ask me to check in? Check in at the front desk is very slow! Such a big hotel cannot use foreign cards! I showed the certificate to the waiter and said that I couldn't see the room I booked on Ctrip! Take a look at my order on Ctrip! And the hotel lobby is very windy! very cold! The room is a full sea view suite, the sound of the wind and waves is loud! Very noisy! The children's play facilities in the hotel are very small, and the indoor slide üõù is not suitable for children under the age of three! Ask the service center for mineral water to make milk for your child, and you will get ten small bottles of water! It feels like a small store! In November last year, I stayed at the Atlantis Hotel and asked for mineral water to make milk for my child. The waiter sent a box! Cleaning every day is just to replenish the supplies casually, the floor is not wiped! In short, this parent-child experience hotel is a bit disappointing!

There is an airport bus and a bus to the duty-free shop. It also provides discounts and coupons for the duty-free shop, which saves a lot of money.

msg:Taking a baby on vacation for a week to experience Yanlord Crown, which is known as the parent-child ceiling in Sanya, is summarized as follows:
1. Advantages
1. Considerate and humanized service
    Take the initiative to contact and confirm the itinerary and required room items one day in advance of check-in, and arrange the room type in advance. The butler service responds and solves problems quickly. The waiter cleans the house at least twice a day, sends small toys, fruits and desserts, and the training of the entire service team is relatively in place.
2. Complete facilities, comfortable and clean
    The room is well-equipped, clean and tidy. The bathroom is Villeroy & Boch, Dyson hair dryer, and Samsung TV. The bed is very comfortable to sleep in. There are flowers in the room. The overall facilities are in line with the hotel's positioning and price level.
3. Well-equipped facilities for children and rich activities
    The children's paddling pool and the infinity pool on the top floor are both constant temperature pools, and bath towels are heated. There are children's restaurants, children's playgrounds, small trains and various indoor and outdoor children's activities.
4. Rich and delicious breakfast
    I have stayed in many five-star hotels in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay, but I have not eaten a better and richer breakfast than Crown Crown. In my heart, it basically belongs to the ceiling. It is rich and delicious. Hainan noodles and beef brisket noodles are amazing.
Two, deficiencies
1. There is no washing machine in the room. Although there is paid laundry, it is still a little inconvenient for parent-child hotels that need to frequently wash intimate clothes.
2. The toilet is not a smart bathroom, which is a minus item compared to the overall facilities of the room.
3. Although there are plenty of children's activities, they are less watery than Yalong Bay Parent-child Hotel. For example, the parent-child bubble party in the swimming pool is just a bubble party, and there is no organized small game, which is not fun enough.
4. There is a lack of Japanese food for breakfast. There are no common meals such as sashimi and sushi, and there is only one soba noodle, which is relatively scarce compared to Western and Chinese meals.
Summary: Different from Yalong Bay‚Äôs sandy beaches, Haitang Bay mainly uses shopping in hotels and surrounding attractions for entertainment, so the requirements for hotel services and facilities are higher than those in Yalong Bay. Although the details of the crown still need to be improved, the flaws are not hidden. Overall The check-in experience basically meets expectations, and I will consider it next time.
PS: Special thanks to the ambassador Emily. I know that I am very busy, but it still does not affect the speed of replying and handling questions. It can be seen that the work efficiency and attitude are excellent; I also thank the room attendant Lu Xiaoyu for cleaning the room every day.

msg:‚ô•Ô∏èIf someone really cares about your needs, you will feel it immediately. If someone genuinely cares about your little one, you'll feel it right away, too.
This is my experience of Yanlord Crowne Plaza Hotel. It is also the reason why the mother of a child with chronic allergies was deeply moved by this hotel.
üî¥My child has chronic allergies and cannot eat many foods, such as dairy products, seafood, beef, sheep, fish, sunflower seeds, etc. When I go out, I am most worried about eating. If I don‚Äôt pay attention to the allergies, I will develop rashes and shortness of breath all over the body. .
On the night of our stay, we chose to have a buffet at the hotel. I found that not only the name of each dish, but also ingredients that are prone to allergies, such as those containing gluten, and those containing seafood. This is the detail that is different from other hotels.
When picking up the food for the children, I casually asked the staff about the ingredients that were not marked on the food, and he answered me patiently. After I indicated the situation, he said that he was going to make a separate food for the children. I said grateful.
After a while, the waiter brought a pot of clear soup with chicken and vegetables. The waiter said that the person who just talked to me is their head chef, and they need to know more specific information about children's allergies, and they will make breakfast for the children alone in the next two days. Then the waiter took out a notebook, squatted next to me, and carefully listed allergies. After reporting to the head chef, he gave me a separate recipe for tomorrow's breakfast, and asked if I could prepare it before we went to the restaurant, and the approximate meal time. At this time, I was already very moved.
The next day we came to the restaurant for breakfast. After reporting the room number and taking a seat, the head chef personally brought food made for the children individually, and gave me the breakfast menu for the third day, and asked if I needed to adjust it. Does my child have any allergies after eating last night? The same was true on the third day. A rich and delicious "special meal" was given.
From the details of writing in a notebook, giving the menu a day in advance, and calculating our meal time, as a parent, I very much recognize the seriousness of the work of the catering depar**ent. üçó
üìçSpeaking of the overall experience of the hotel, the environment and hardware facilities are not to be chosen. Basic services such as welcome garlands at the door, luggage sent directly to the room, and turndown are all done well. The superior sea view room we booked is near the bow of the ship, opposite Atlantis. The room provides some children's products for free. In addition to toiletries, there are also bed rails (this is very important), toy building blocks, stepping stools, etc.
The hotel also gives 10 free travel photos, which can be squeezed.
The hotel buffet is 300+/person on weekdays and 400+/person on weekends. If you go out to eat, you need to take a car to the nearby commercial street.
The children's playground is relatively mini, but there are quite a lot of swimming pools, and there is an infinity pool on the top floor.
üéàChildren were reluctant to leave after playing, and when they got home, they received a gift from the hotel, which was so heartwarming.

msg:Very good check-in experience. First of all, I would like to praise the housekeeper Kily. She is very enthusiastic and does a good job. The day before the flight, we added WeChat on the phone. We mentioned that we need an extra bed, buckwheat husk pillows, children's toilet seat, and the circumference of the bed. Stop, do everything, there is no charge for extra beds, and children's breakfast is free. On the first day of check-in, we asked for children's quilts and other items, and we also fulfilled them one by one. Once I lost my slippers on the beach, the housekeeper quickly sent a new pair, which is great! ! The biggest feature of the room is that the balcony is oversized, blowing the sea breeze, and it is very comfortable to lie on the oversized lounge chair on the balcony. The cleanliness is also super fast every day, and once in the morning and once in the afternoon, there is also a special person to deliver fruits, drinks and snacks. Every employee in the hotel has a very good service attitude, making people happy physically and mentally. I have lived in Tianyu for several years. Although it is more expensive than Tianyu, the service and room comfort are much better than Tianyu. The children's swimming pool has a constant temperature and can play for hours. Adults just need to lie on the free deck chairs. There is free water and bath towel service. In addition, the non-alcoholic Mojito is delicious. The water temperature of the infinity pool on the 15th floor is very comfortable, and children's floats are also provided free of charge, but the wind is super strong, so you have to put on a bath towel as soon as you go ashore. The breakfast is so rich that I can't eat enough every day. The waves in Haitang Bay are huge, you must pay attention to safety, don't go into the sea, it is very refreshing to step on the waves. It is only 1 km away from the largest duty-free city in Sanya, and it is just a short walk away. It is also 1 km away from Atlantis. The underwater world is worth visiting. The food and beverages in the hotel are a little expensive. You can go to the duty-free city and order takeout for meals. Takeaways cannot enter the hotel. The concierge will pick them up outside the hotel. The service is very good. The hotel lobby is a bit far from the hotel gate. You can ask the concierge to drive a battery car to the door, or you can pick it up from the door to the lobby. My baby is 8 years old, and the hotel's children's activities may be more suitable for younger ages. My baby steps on the waves every day, picks up shells, builds sand castles, and the children's pool. These are very cool. Sand digging tools, mineral water, and beach folding chairs are all free. We caught up with the Lantern Festival, and the hotel held entertainment activities, as well as dragon and lion dance performances. The experience was very good! !

The service was very enthusiastic from the beginning to the end, and I answered every question. Given the Chinese restaurant and the children's restaurant, The follow-up service is also super professional because I arranged to shoot in the morning of check-out. I knew that I was going to leave the store and rushed out the photos to let me choose the film first. The overall service was very good, and the activities were also very rich. After the two children checked out Later, when I arrived at Atlantis, I still lingered on Renheng. The claw machine on the first floor and the heated children's swimming pool caught their hearts. Summary: It is especially suitable for babies under the age of six who are not very different from each other. (Although my sister is 9 years old this time, she also had a good time.) It will be enough for eating, drinking and playing, and the breakfast is also very rich. The room I booked There is a VIP lounge service, and Starbucks has unlimited drinks from 7:00-22:00! The infinity pool on the 15th floor was the most complained about. We felt that it was okay, because the water was warm and the wind was strong, but as long as we were in the water, it was not cold. When we came up, the staff handed us hot towels, which was very considerate!

msg:Check-in: The hotel check-in is relatively fast, it is the peak season, we arrived at 2 o'clock, and the room came out at 3 o'clock. There is a crown experience ambassador at the front desk. When you check in, she will come to tell you about the hotel facilities, and then add WeChat. My ambassador was "Ashley" a beautiful girl with a friendly and polite attitude. After we added WeChat to each other, we can find her for everything, and the reply speed is fast, even if the problem is solved. He also helped us make appoin**ents for children's activities, arranged for hotel drop-offs, gave me coupons for duty-free shops, asked me if the pillows were suitable, and even sent a dessert to the room for the children. Just ask her for anything.
Gardens and entertainment: The hotel looks like a sailing ship. In fact, the hotel's garden is not big. There are several swimming pools in the garden. It's all at room temperature, and some are cold without swimming. There is a children's swimming pool, the water is very shallow, and there are children's slides that are constant temperature. The water feels a little warm, and it won't be too cold to play in winter. The location of this children's swimming pool is relatively sheltered from the wind. You must know that the wind in Haitang Bay can be very strong. There is still half an hour of bubble time at 4:30 p.m. every day. The kids like it very much. The hotel garden can go directly to the beach. The small train in the park is free to do during the start time. The kids club has a not-so-big crawl and two Street Fighter consoles. There is free mineral water in the club. I still think the kids club is a bit small, it should be expanded! Disposable socks are provided free of charge. Next to the children's club, there are several amusement machines that you can buy coins to play with, some for catching dolls, and some for games. I bought 20 coins for 50 yuan, and 60 coins for 100 yuan. Children can take the stamp booklet to participate in each activity and stamp, and how many stamps they collect can be exchanged for game coins. There is a small football field next to the swimming pool around 5 pm every day, and there are activities for children to break through the levels. Regarding football, after breaking through several levels, you can exchange for small toys or game coins on the spot. So you don‚Äôt need to rush to buy game coins, but exchange some with activities first. Of course, the claw machine also belongs to the type of most muscle weakness. There is also a small chef for children who needs to make an appoin**ent every day. You can ask the ambassador to help you make an appoin**ent. Except for this appoin**ent, other children's activities are not available. Did not see child care. I don't know if there is. All children's activities do not need to spend money except for the game currency. By the way, hot brown sugar ginger water, first aid kit, and mineral water will be carefully prepared by the pool. uninterrupted. This is something I haven't seen in other hotels. In this hotel, Baisui Mountain mineral water is everywhere. free! free! The heated swimming pool on the roof has beautiful scenery and suitable water temperature. The only downside is that the wind is too strong and too cold. People who don't swim can hardly stand up. The body of the swimmer is in the water, but the head is out of the water, and the brain hurts from blowing. Especially at the moment of going ashore, it felt like an ice sculpture as soon as the excrement was frozen. I can't figure it out, how to eat afternoon tea at the 270-degree sea view restaurant on the roof? Eat a cool breeze. It is strongly recommended that the swimming pool on the roof can be changed, adding glass? Add a windshield? The gym is also on the roof, facing Atlantis where you can exercise. The gym is almost empty. The price of spa is about 800-1000. No experience.
Room: We booked a parent-child room with twin beds and a bunk bed. The upper berth is a little narrower, and people require that they can only sleep children, and the lower berth is 1.5, so it is no problem to sleep two people. The pillow is a bit soft, you can ask the ambassador to give you a latex pillow. Our room faced Atlantis, with a better view and a wide view. The only downside is that there is no balcony. There is only one window that opens to about 45 degrees. Slightly suffocated. We can look at the sea sideways. Drinks and snacks in the mini refrigerator in the room are free and replenished every day. If you don't like carbonated drinks, you can ask the ambassador to change them. The welcome fruit is abundant and of good quality. Also give a Bulgari toiletry set. Six bottles of Baisui Mountain every day.
Meals: There are a lot of people eating breakfast during the peak season, but you don‚Äôt need to find a table yourself, the staff at the door will lead you to the table. When there are many people, you need to wait in line. The breakfast is the richest and fastest updated in the hotel I have stayed in. No empty disks were seen. There are staff members who have been walking around, urging changes. Pancakes, omelettes, noodles, these popular ones have two equipment and two chefs cooking at the same time. If there is a long queue for noodle cookers, someone will come out and take it for you to cook. This greatly reduces the waiting time for shooting. thumbs up. The breakfast tastes good, every dish has the taste of every dish. It's not the kind of dish that tastes the same. And marshmallows, fruity chocolate waterfall towers. Sirloin, dessert, and Chinese food are all available (Chinese stir-fried dishes are slightly less). In addition to the coffee machine, you can also order handmade coffee. Like a cold latte. Strong coffee taste. Therefore, the service staff has a good attitude and is not in a hurry. I don't use the restaurant for Chinese dinner. You can order takeaway for Chinese dinner. There are too many delivery restaurants around. They were sent to the hotel gate, and then the hotel staff drove the battery car to the lobby gate.
Summary: The hotel has done a good job in parenting. There are large and small activities in each time period. It is recommended to increase children's care throughout the day. In this way, adults can properly go to the duty-free shop! ! Drinking water, I feel like I don‚Äôt need to spend money on drinks. There are enough drinks in the mini fridge. Although the garden is not big, it is enough to take pictures. There will be some small tents, small facilities for taking pictures, and there are also agencies that specialize in taking pictures in the hotel. Except for the slightly expensive price, everything else is very goodüëçüëçI want to go next time!

msg:On February 17th, our whole family started their trip to Sanya with a happy mood. The hotel we stayed at was Crowne Plaza Yanlord, an Internet celebrity hotel that has been planted for a long time. Suzy, our crown experience butler, was very enthusiastic and solved the problems we encountered. , gave us good travel advice on the way. Because we brought the elderly and children, we did not join the group, but traveled independently. This time we chose Wuzhizhou Island, Paradise Forest Park, and the Aquarium. The itinerary is relatively loose, and the babies have enough time to stay in the hotel. Yanlord As expected of a parent-child hotel, there are plenty of activities set up, but they still love the swimming pool and bubble show even more, and they even went to the beach to dig sand and ride horses, having a great time. On the last day, Suzy also thoughtfully sent snacks to the children, and they were very happy to see the desserts. Yanlord is indeed more parent-child. The restaurant is very warm and cute. You can also borrow all kinds of children's supplies for free. I hope to stay here again next timeüòÄ

The room is very large and has a good view of the sea. If there is a need, contact Kily directly on WeChat to reply and deal with it in a timely manner. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, and the children's water park is also very happy. I didn't go to any scenic spots, just playing in the hotel and on the beach is enough, a relatively leisurely vacation, very comfortable.
There are hot towels at the swimming pool and the beach, tools for children to play with sand, and mineral water, all of which are more considerate. The children's bathrobes are changed several times a day, the sanitation work in the room is also good, and the garbage is cleaned up in time.
The hotel also has ginger tea. The sea breeze is relatively strong. If you are afraid of catching a cold, you can ask the customer service for ginger tea.
It‚Äôs just that the photos taken during the trip are so beautiful, I couldn‚Äôt help but buy a few more üòÇ
The day before check-out, Kily also gave away small snacks. The children were very happy, but the small potato chips were gone on the last day, so I was a little disappointedüòµ
All in all, the next time you go to the seaside for a vacation, you can choose a hotel again.

The staff were very friendly when I got off the bus, and the room was cleaned very quickly. At the front desk, Anna, the housekeeper, added my WeChat account and told me the location of the restaurant very carefully. , helped me book a duty-free bus and dinner, and told me to pay attention to mosquitoes. The whole check-in experience was very comfortable, the room was quiet and not noisy, and I liked the crown better than Atlantis. Babies of all ages can play here I am very happy, there are many swimming pools, and there is also a heated swimming pool. In the afternoon, there is a bubble fight and the children have fun. It was the first time I saw that the hotel even prepared sunscreen, facial cleanser and mosquito repellent. There were also potato chips in the mini bar. The child was very happy haha. There is also a naughty castle indoors. The key is that the breakfast and buffet dinner are super delicious, the price is not expensive, there are many types, and there are many people during the Chinese New Year, but it is not too crowded. Everyone can travel at off-peak hours and will come again. Sincerity is the only thing Nirvana, makes people feel friendly

talk about the hotel
Hygiene: Not bad, the staff cleans in a timely manner, even if it is outdoors, there are many tourists, it is very clean and tidy.
Environment: There are not as many green plants as Yalong Bay, and there are many tourists, so it will be relatively noisy.
Service: The staff are very enthusiastic, take the initiative to say hello, and actively communicate to solve problems.
Facilities: relatively new, there is a constant temperature water playground in the direction of the beach, the location is very good, the wind is so strong by the sea, the wind here is very small.
In addition to giving birth to a baby, I travel and stay in hotels every year. Let me talk about the experience ambassador Emily, a beautiful little girl from the hot spring, who adds WeChat when checking in. Every time I ask a question, I reply almost instantly, because I want to give the baby I made milk and immediately delivered bottled water. If I lost something, I actively contacted my colleagues and found it quickly and sent it to the room. From time to time, I cared about what the children needed. It was really considerate and made people feel comfortable! This kind of staff will really add a lot of points to the hotel! If there is a chance, we will meet again! Looking forward to better!

Yanlord has obviously done better and more exquisitely in terms of service, dishes, decoration, and details of materials. The design of the hotel also pays more attention to the sense of space and natural charm. The whole "big ship" is not like an ordinary hotel. Its interior design allows the wind to flow in the building, just like a sailing ship, standing between the floors You can also feel the sea breeze, the seating settings in the environment are more comfortable, and the materials used are closer to nature, such as logs/straw weaving/matting/bamboo stickers. My favorite thing to do these days is to lie on the balcony and watch the sea. The hotel's butler service Very good, it reminds the necessary precautions at key nodes, and responds to the proposed needs in a timely manner. My housekeeper is called kily, I hope she can enjoy her work and give warmth to more guests.

You can also order food directly to the pool loungers. The children are crazy about playing, eat and play again!
The hotel has a variety of activities, most of which are suitable for children under 6 years old, and older children will feel childish. We participated in the making of Variety Twisting Sticks and Wood Bran Cups, both of which are relatively simple.
The game console at the entrance of the restaurant is very popular with my baby. I bought 600 yuan coins before and after, which is really enough to play!
Great breakfast! It is the most abundant of all the hotels we have stayed in. The beef brisket noodles are so delicious, I eat a bowl every morning.
The travel photography provided by the hotel is very sincere. I originally wanted to arrange a travel photography at Hilton, but saw that Yanlord Crown sent 10 negatives, as well as aerial photography and small videos, so I made an appoin**ent here. Finally, 8 photos were added, each for 20 yuan.
Butler-style service, introducing hotel facilities, play items, helping to book activities, asking about accommodation, etc. Flowers and desserts were also sent to the room on Valentine's Day. In short very satisfied!

Besides the service, melody is our experience ambassador, which really makes us feel that the service has already started before people check in.

Overall, I am very satisfied , Travel photography is also good, the level of finishing is average, and finishing is not recommended.

All kinds of things in the hotel are thoughtful, there are disposable bathtub covers, toilet covers, disposable mouthwash, and even sunscreen for children. Not bad, but the playground is too small, children's activities are also very tasteless, the breakfast is very rich, but there are many people after 9 o'clock, sand digging tools are provided for free on the beach, the swimming pool on the top floor is good, but the changing room is too small and the wind is very strong, In short, it is still worth recommending, and the little friends had a lot of fun.

The room view is also good, especially the breakfast is too rich, and the children's activities are full every day. Thank you very much for the careful care of experience ambassador Suzy, thank you for your hard work!

There are also a lot of parent-child activities designed in the hotel, and you can have fun without leaving the hotel! The housekeeper, Kily, contacted us very early and gave us a lot of travel suggestions, thank you very much! The hotel's cooperative travel photography provides clothing and makeup, and the photographer is also very good at capturing photos. The overall experience is great! !

msg:The Crowne Plaza Haitang Bay Yanlord Hotel is the place to stay during the Spring Festival holiday. Compared with hotels that frequently doubled during the Spring Festival, the price fluctuation is still within an acceptable range. I have stayed in 8 hotels in Haitang Bay, Yalong Bay, but Yanlord Crown's service and breakfast are simply too impressive. As soon as you check in, there will be caring ambassador Melody's considerate hotel facilities, introduction of amu*****t projects, and timely response to any questions. During the stay, there was a leak in the sewer of the washbasin. Because the hotel was full during the Spring Festival, it was impossible to change the room. Melody and the duty manager Ethan actively resolved it and tried every possible remedial measures. I was very moved and a very good experience. Yanlord Crown is the best choice for traveling with children.

Special praise to the housekeeper Joy, the service is absolutely excellent, the child is allergic, the first time I arranged for a nurse to come and see, and gave the child a small doll when he left, the child likes it very much, time is limited, and there are many praises here. Said one by one! !

It's also very convenient to eat in the hotel, the taste is quite satisfactory, there is a children's restaurant (children like it very much), and my baby doesn't want to go downstairs in the morning for breakfast, so I can pack it back to the room to eat!

There are also many activities for children, (I will not upload photos if there are children) Two or three days will definitely not be enough to play, the children are very happy to play! There is also a good swimming pool on the 15th floor. It is more relaxing to have a drink and look at the scenery.

Next time you have time, you must take your children to stay for five or six days! !

The only regret is that the custody procedure is a bit cumbersome and the time is limited. But it does not affect the overall experience, the restaurant dishes are very diverse and delicious. The overall rhythm is slower than that of Atlantis next door. It is suitable for a flat hotel. There are super rich parent-child activities and the beach view is also great. The birthday cake was not given. It happened to be the afternoon when I checked out and went to the airport. I was in a hurry. It seemed that I needed to book in advance. It was a pity.

The breakfast is very good üëç I have been to so many luxury hotels all over the country and Southeast Asia, and the breakfast in your store can be said to be the first TOP1. There are many types, fast replenishment, and local Hainan specialties. 2. The service is very good. There are one-to-one butler-type service personnel, who deliver water and quilts very quickly. When washing clothes, there will also be service personnel who will ask questions about the clothes carefully. 3. The facilities and services are very good üëå The swimming pool on the 15th floor is amazing, and there are relatively few people, so you can swim freely. And there are really a lot of children's games, next time I will bring children to playüöò

üí°Small comments: 1. There is no exhaust fan in the toilet, and the smell dissipates slowly. The room is a little stuffy when the air conditioner is not on. 2. The flip-flops provided by the hotel are as hard as iron, and the feet hurt a bit when worn. 3. The hotel does not seem to have a small barbecue bar that is open until around one o'clock in the morning, and it is also a little distance from the tavern outside (a bit far to walk)

Better than many big international hotel chains. Customers who value software can really try this üòãüòãüòãüòã

msg:Crowne Plaza Yanlord is worthy of being the "ceiling" of a parent-child hotel. After a comprehensive comparison, it is definitely the first choice for family vacations in Sanya, and it is strongly recommended.
[Location] The hotel is located in the north of Haitang Bay, about 15 minutes walk from Sanya International Duty Free City, shopping and dining are very convenient.
[Environment] The hotel is shaped like a big boat. There is a large lawn and coconut grove behind the building. You can walk through the coconut grove to reach the beach (about 2 minutes' walk). The beach is clean and the sand is fine.
[Room] The hotel is very new, the room is very tidy and clean, and the facilities are well maintained, which makes people feel at ease. The family parent-child suite is highly recommended, with two separate bedrooms (both with bathroom and shower room), three balconies with a 90-degree view of the sea, and one of the balconies has tents, rocking horses, building blocks and other toys. The mini bar in the room is also very conscientious. It is fully replenished with various soft drinks every day. The drinking water is packed in cartons, which is very special.
[Facilities] Various parent-child amu*****t facilities are arranged in the public area of the hotel, including small trains, sand dredging tools, indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds, children's swimming pools, children's clubs, etc., which are available for free for hotel guests. The hotel's children's water park is very large, and there are bubble baths every afternoon. It is worth mentioning the infinity swimming pool on the roof of the hotel. Although the hotel does not advertise this swimming pool, the actual experience is excellent. The temperature is constant at 30 degrees, there are few people, and the scenery is beautiful. There is also a shallow pool for children on one side. It is recommended to check in.
[Activities] The hotel has a lot of parent-child activities, which are not the same from morning to night. The children in the family participated in handmade pizza, jungle adventure, making little spiders, interacting with dinosaurs, etc., and had a great time. If the children in the family are over 4 years old, the adults can basically be liberated.
[Dining] The hotel's breakfast room is very large, with a very rich variety, comparable to the buffet lunch or dinner in some places. We used the buffet in the executive lounge of the suite residents in the afternoon and evening. Although the dishes are not many, they are exquisite and the service is good. It is especially worry-free for families with children. In particular, the hotel cooperates with Starbucks. You can order Starbucks coffee for free in the infinity pool and the executive lounge, as well as the raw coconut latte, which tastes very good.
[Service] The hotel's various services are of high quality, and the staff will take the initiative to greet and provide help. In particular, Ms. Suzy, the experience ambassador, took the initiative to introduce the arrangement of parent-child activities and answered our various questions tirelessly. And help us apply for late check-out, very satisfied, must be highly praised!
[Others] The experience of the hotel's gift of Green Brigade is very good. The photographer Wei Jun and the film selector Qing Er are very professional and patient.

When there were many guests and it was full, we arranged the check-in at one o‚Äôclock and the view of the room was very good. If you have any needs during the period, send Kiki a message. Very timely reply and solution.
The hotel is very suitable for parents and children. There is a restaurant for children. The taste is very good and the price is not expensive
There is a Starbucks on the top floor. The scenery is very good, but the wind is strong. I want to have afternoon tea, but the wind is too strong
The little train is made for free. Friends like it very much. There are activities during breakfast. The balloons given are folded into bears, pumpkins and other shapes. Children like it very much
There are various activities for children. Kiki made an appoin**ent for us to make pizza in advance. It was fun and the finished product was unexpectedly delicious. One per person is also very clean
There are also bath towels and mineral water in the swimming pool, free makeup and clothing are provided for the photo shoot, and the price of multiple photos is not expensive
Of course there are some problems
Strollers in the children's restaurant should be parked in a place that is not in the way. My baby accidentally bumped into it and bled, and my coffee was placed on the table in the children's restaurant. It takes ten minutes to take the children to make pizza. Although the clerk came to ask about these two things, I didn‚Äôt think it was very sincere as the person involved. In addition, I saw in other comments that there were small desserts for us, but we didn‚Äôt receive them.
overall very satisfied

This time I chose Yanlord Crowne Plaza, which was attracted by the infinity pool on the top floor. In the end, it was because the butler service left a deep impression on me. Of course, the view of the infinity pool is amazing!
This time the housekeeper is Suzy. She contacted us before check-in and asked about the room requirements. She spoke very softly and was very careful. She arranged a good room for us. We stayed for 2 nights in a row, and Suzy sent a Bulgari accessory, three drink coupons in the lobby bar, and a large dessert for the last night. The hotel's buffet breakfast is also great. There are many choices, both Chinese and Western, and the service is thoughtful. In short, the experience is very good, it is worth recommending!

I was quite satisfied with the hotel during this trip. Later, I stayed at the Haitang Bay Mangrove. The latter is simply a nigh**are hotel. In comparison, Yanlord is really very good.
First of all, the housekeeper, Suzy, contacted us one day earlier‚ûïWechat and told her if we needed anything. The arrangement was thoughtful and he would ask us for any needs every day. I have to say that Yanlord‚Äôs meticulous service has impressed our family.
Furthermore, it is necessary to praise the breakfast! It's really delicious! Jujube oa**eal, corn juice, latte, all kinds of powder, really endless aftertaste
Secondly, the free activities arranged by the hotel are also rich and colorful, but they are indeed more suitable for young children. My family is 4 years old and 6 and a half years old, and I am very happy to participate in the activities
Finally, there are too many people! The few days before the Spring Festival are not considered the peak of Haitang Bay, but Yanheng is full of houses, and people follow the crowd for everything

Finally, the night before the pick-up, I had a meal arranged by the housekeeper.

Now I still insist on booking this hotel, but unfortunately Sanya has become very popular recently, I only booked for one night, but it is still unforgettable! A strong recommendation has been sent to the circle of friends! The concierge service is very thoughtful, the sea view from the balcony is superb, the details of the room are in place, and the consideration is extremely thoughtful. The comment says that it is the ceiling of a parent-child hotel, which is not an exaggeration at all. Parent-child slippers, parent-child washing, play facilities, rich activities... and a small doll for the children. The sanitation is cleaned in a timely manner, and the butler provides full service. Very praise! It happened to be my sister's birthday on the day of check-in, and we were very happy with the cake and birthday decorations. One more point, it must be mentioned that the quality of the hotel‚Äôs travel photos is very good. You can get simple makeup, and you can also borrow clothes. You can send 10 digital photos for free, more than 20 yuan, and 50 yuan for a refined one. But the quality of the photos is high, and we all feel that the money is worth it.

msg:Sanya Yanlord Crown Hotel:
Conclusion: The hotel has standardized management, pays attention to details, attaches importance to customer experience, and has unique parent-child projects, which are worth recommending.
1. Hardware: It has all the facilities of a five-star hotel. Although the grade is not outstanding, it is still relatively good and can meet basic needs. Especially the big bed in the room we stayed in, which is two 1.2-meter beds spliced ‚Äã‚Äãtogether, which is really suitable for families with one or two children; the hotel's 15th-floor heated swimming pool is very distinctive, with a very good view and great sunrise; there are four outdoor swimming pools, including a children's water park and a 1.5-meter-deep swimming pool, which meet the needs of different groups of people. The water in the swimming pool is very clean; the breakfast types are very rich and varied.
2. Service: The staff has a good service attitude and has a good service awareness and ability, including porters, lobby receptionists, receptionists for formalities, cleaners, restaurant staff, swimming pool staff, customer service butlers, etc., all of which reflect this point.
3. Management standards and attention to details: (1) Management standards: During our stay (three days), the hotel was fully booked. We were worried that the hotel's service would not be able to keep up, but it turned out that we were worrying too much. For example, although the breakfast restaurant was crowded, it was well-organized. Each staff member performed their duties and was able to complete their own work and take the initiative to quickly deal with some emergencies. The children's program was arranged in advance for different time periods, which not only met everyone's needs but also avoided chaos due to the large number of people. The sofa seats in the lobby were cleaned by the staff to ensure a good experience for the next customer. (2) Attention to details: The hotel provides toilet covers, which is good news for customers who love hygiene. The hotel beach provides children with sand digging tools, which is very good. As long as we set the do not disturb function in our room, no waiter will ring the doorbell to disturb us, and will not enter the room at will when we are not in the room. There are many other details that I will not list one by one.
4. Attach importance to customer experience. It can be felt that this is not just a slogan, but has been integrated into the corporate culture of this hotel. Almost every employee is practicing this. The one we deal with the most is the housekeeper Kiki. She responds quickly to all our questions and responds to all requests. She also gives us some unexpected little surprises every day, which makes us feel very good. In addition, from many behavioral details of other employees, we can also feel that each of them pays attention to the customer experience. In addition, the third-party travel photography company cooperating with the hotel is also very service-minded. After we complained to the first photographer, they handled it in time and proposed a solution for us. In the end, we were very satisfied.
5. The parent-child project is very distinctive. Our daughter is 8 years old and participated in most of the children's projects in three days. When we left the hotel, she felt reluctant to leave for the first time in her life. She said that she liked the children's project of this hotel too much. If she could live every day, she would be willing to stay until she was 22 years oldüòÇ.

msg:First of all, let me talk about the check-in experience: the first time I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Yanlord, the housekeeper Avril contacted me one day before check-in, asked me about my hotel needs, and sent me the hotel's children's activity arrangements and time. After I checked in, Avril has been paying attention to my check-in experience. When I need help, she always helps me solve it at the first time. She is a very good housekeeperüëç.
        We stayed here for 5 days and the kids couldn't get enough of it. First, the hotel arranges a lot of children's activities every day, and the children like it very much. Secondly, it has been cloudy and not warm for the past few days we have been here, and the temperature of the outdoor swimming pool is a bit low, but there is a heated swimming pool here, and the water temperature is very suitable for children to swim. It is also very close from the hotel to the beach, just a small road through the hotel. The hotel provides sand digging tools for free, and children can choose their favorite toys before going to the beach. Also, whether it is indoor, outdoor swimming pool, or beach, the bath towels provided by the hotel are warm, and it is very considerate for children to wear them to keep warm. There are floating boards of different sizes by the pool and life jackets for children. There may be more children swimming and the lifeguards are also very responsible for patrolling around the pool all the time, and a swimming pool hotel is equipped with multiple lifeguards, which makes me feel at ease.
        The executive lounge of the hotel is also very good, not to mention the food, all hotels are similar, what I want to say is that the executive lounge here is more humane, the child is swimming, I am afraid that she will be hungry, so I go to the executive lounge to ask if it is okay You can pack a sandwich for me, and the service staff will pack it for me without saying a word, give me a big thumbs upüëç
        I'm talking about the room, the room is huge, and it's not crowded at all with children. Sanitation is very clean. Not to mention the ones that are commonly used by adults. The hotel provides children with sunscreen, mosquito repellent, children‚Äôs toothbrush, toothpaste (especially the real children‚Äôs toothpaste), children‚Äôs shower gel, laundry detergent, and other things I remember. I can't stand it anymore. In short, it is equipped with everything that children often use. Finally, I would like to praise Niuniu, who cleans the room, for her clean work, politeness and enthusiasm.
         There was a lot of nagging. To sum up, I don't particularly like taking pictures, but it doesn't affect my good opinion of the hotel. Comfortable living, safe play, mothers who want to have a good rest and have to take care of their babies, it is highly recommended!
        The most important point at the end: Special saving mom! ! !

In addition Although I have stayed many times, I still have to praise the swimming pool on the 15th floor on the top floor for a good view. It is worth recommending. In short, it is the favorite of the children, and I will come again in the future [Happy]

When you know that the child‚Äôs birthday is also a cake and dessert, you will be notified sooner or later. , especially meticulous and considerate, and gave a doll toy before leaving.
Yanlord Hotel is indeed the ceiling of parent-child hotels in Sanya. I have stayed in several high-end hotels in Sanya several times. After comparison, this one is still the most suitable for parents and children. The hotel has all kinds of facilities for children. In winter, the children's pool and the infinity pool on the 15th floor are heated. Go to the beach to play in the afternoon. The water temperature is suitable, the sea water is clean, and the beach is soft. Special reminder that the best beach in Sanya is in Haitang Bay. The seaside of Yalong Bay is full of coral sand.
The hotel has free children's activities throughout the day, which can be voluntary and liberate adults. There are also free travel photos, free 10 photos, and free makeup and clothing. The view of the sea view in the room is superb. Drinks and snacks in the refrigerator are provided free of charge every day, as well as coconut milk and milk. In short, you don‚Äôt have to come out after entering the hotel, just enjoy the good time.

Melody immediately helped to coordinate the extension to 2 o'clock.

Although there are many people staying in the hotel, from the moment we got off the car, we felt the meticulous service. When we got off the car, someone opened the door to pick up the luggage, and when we entered the lobby to check in, someone explained the hotel's facilities and activities immediately during the queuing process. Every employee of the hotel has received strict training and provides enthusiastic and proactive service. In particular, I would like to praise Avril for his basic one-on-one butler service throughout the whole process. The hotel's breakfast is also very good, with a variety of varieties.

The housekeeper NANCY who served us not only contacted us in advance to help with various arrangements, but also responded to any suggestions. I am very active in listening, and I will not think of excuses to find reasons like other hotels, but consider the problem from the customer's point of view! The service attitude of this hotel is really very good, and the two managers on duty Eason and Tim who communicated halfway are also super NICE!
Catering: The breakfast in the hotel is very rich and tastes good, especially all kinds of sweets, desserts and ice cream that children like
Entertainment: There are various games in the hotel to participate in. There are children‚Äôs playgrounds on the first floor and the second floor respectively. There are many people on the first floor. There are not only indoor and outdoor playgrounds, but also painting tables and TVs. There are also various electric coin-operated game machines outside , Actively participate in hotel activities, you can exchange some game coins for free, or you can buy them yourself; the wonderland on the second floor is more suitable for reptile children. There are not many things, and it is a bit desolate. It would be better if there are more static toys. The small train cycle Transfer for free rides.
There are basically everything for children in the hotel, don‚Äôt worry about forgetting anything, it‚Äôs the first choice for bringing children to play

The various activities for children are arranged very well, but there is a serious problem. This time it took a long time and I stayed for 11 days. This place is meant for children to be happy, but I haven‚Äôt slept well for the past few nights. The biggest problem with this hotel is that the sound insulation is too bad. I changed the room and upgraded the room. It‚Äôs still very noisy. If you‚Äôre a light sleeper, don‚Äôt come here. During the World Cup, from 9:00 pm to 5:00 am, they moved the stools and beds, their furniture was too heavy, and the friction of the floor was too loud. The room next to me had a normal big bed. The room actually accommodates 6 people. Poor sound insulation is the biggest problem of this hotel. It's too noisy
Of course, the hotel manager, including my butler Joy, is still very good. Their service is full marks. They have been giving condolences every day and sent gifts. Maybe they can‚Äôt do anything about it.

However, the hotel's follow-up arrangements can be regarded as keeping up, so the star will not be deducted. Because the service is really good. The check-in was upgraded to the side facing Atlantis. The view is very good, especially the big balcony, which is very comfortable. The sanitation is very good, and the minibar is also very generous, but I need to make complaints about it. The coffee is instant coffee, which is not worthy of the price. The most distinctive feature is the infinity pool on the top floor, which has a unique view, especially when watching the sunrise in the morning. The breakfast is also very rich. The only point is that it is a very popular parent-child hotel. It is noisy even in non-peak seasons, not to mention peak seasons, so if you want to be quiet, you must consider it.

The hotel's waiters take the initiative to carry luggage, and the front desk butler also warmly introduces the hotel about parent-child activities. One piece of explanation, the room is relatively new compared to this five-star hotel, the balcony is relatively large, the layout is also good, all kinds of anti-mosquito and toiletries are relatively complete, it looks very refreshing, the hotel comes with a constant temperature infinity swimming pool Swimming is also more comfortable. There are children's heated swimming pools and water parks outside, including the bubble party that children like. It is also suitable for children to play. Of course, it also comes with a deep-water swimming pool for adults. During the play, there were some problems during the period, including the package and room arrangement, as well as the problems that were not found in the breakfast cooking and cooking. They could also be solved in time. The service attitude of the solution is commendable, and it is very good to be able to accept some deficiencies seriously. By the way, the guests of the Chinese restaurant in the hotel should experience it. The taste is good and the dishes are exquisite.

Facilities: It‚Äôs in one building, waiting for an elevator for a long time, and all the people are concentrated in one building...
Hygiene: Hygiene is still barely enough, but the minimum cleanliness is still achieved
Environment: There is no environment at all. Although it is a parent-child hotel, there are many activities, but it is very perfunctory.

msg:My three-year-old son is a baby with an epidemic. The epidemic started not long after he was born. The age when he should have been playing everywhere has been locked at home because of the epidemic. He has never left Shanghai or took a plane for three years. So this year's National Day finally took my son to Sanya, did his homework in advance, and chose Yanlord Crown, which is often called the ceiling of a parent-child hotel. Tell me about your actual experience. In a word, the service is worth the price. As soon as you check in, there will be a butler and WeChat attentive service. If you have any questions, you can contact the housekeeper directly. I would like to thank my housekeeper Kily. Your service makes me feel very happy. Stay: Not much to say, the room is clean and tidy, the hotel has all the facilities, our room faces Atlantis and can see the sea, here is a reminder that some things that children need are not in the room at first, You can find the housekeeper or call the hotel, and provide free, such as children's toilets, high stools, etc.; eat: there is a free minibar in the room, which has a lot of food, drinks and snacks. Fruit, and also thoughtfully prepared milk for the children and gave several bottles of water. In the evening, I also ordered the delivery service. The quantity is quite large and the taste is also good. There are a lot of meat sauce noodles and meat sauces üòÄ. Breakfast is delivered to the room, buffet breakfast, there are many things; play: There are many activities for children, and the housekeeper will tell you the activity time and the opening hours of various places as soon as you check in, just like the class schedule.üòÖ. In addition, let‚Äôs talk about the places that I think are good, I am more easily moved by the details. Crab plush toy, this can be regarded as a sign. When I went to the airport to board the plane, the passengers in the same company asked with a smile, did they also live in Yanlord Crown? Seeing the crab in the baby's hand, everyone looked at each other and smiled. There is also a set of Bulgari washing and grooming suits that I am reluctant to use and take back as a souvenir. This is the first time I wrote such a long review, and it was a bit messy. Let's watch it together and feel the real feeling. In the final analysis, when I take my baby to Sanya, where will I stay next time, that is, as long as I am in Haitang Bay, I will definitely choose YanlordüòÅüòÅüòÅ

Melody immediately arranged a more suitable pillow, and I slept well on the back. Other questions are also answered and resolved in a timely manner.

I was traveling alone with my 2 and a half year old baby, and I chose Yanlord. I was really relieved. The hotel has all kinds of equipment, and the furniture is also rounded and will not bump. We arrived in the middle of the night, and still gave the child a welcome flower. The next day, the hotel housekeeper July contacted us in time, and July will meet any needs.
Since it was off season when we went, we upgraded the room. The bed was too big to fit the dirty sleeping bag I brought.
Children under the age of three have relatively low participation in activities, but digging sand and water slides have already made children reluctant to think about it. In the evening, July also sent ginger soup to ward off the cold for the child. Small desserts were also given. The child's first bite of chocolate was given to Yanlord üòÑ
In general, better than expected, you get what you get for every penny... Continue next year‚õΩÔ∏è

On the fourth morning, I was ready to pack my luggage and return home. During breakfast, I chatted with my wife that I didn‚Äôt check in. Heng is still very regretful. He temporarily decided to cancel the ticket and stay in Sanya for one more day, so he booked Yanlord for one night at 9:00 in the morning, checked in at the lobby at 10:00, and checked out at 3:00 p.m. the next day. The whole journey is basically 1.5 days. Some projects have been experienced again. My evaluation of the two-day experience is beyond expectations. I am very fortunate to choose to stay for one more day. The overall hardware of the hotel is relatively new and well maintained. The parent-child services and details are in place. For example, the rooms can rent basic children's products. There are sand tools for children and camp chairs for parents to watch. The parent-child activity was originally thought to be the same as going to a kindergarten class, but it would actually be a lot more interesting. The children had a great time and even gave desserts in the evening. Overall, I am very satisfied and will come again if I have the opportunity.

msg:I am quite satisfied with Yanlord's supporting facilities, especially the Crown Experience Ambassador Avril. The whole process is to serve children with all kinds of activities. Booking in advance is better than this trip. The hotel occupancy rate is not high, not only the environment is clean, but also the room type is upgraded for free. The sea view room has a very good view. I will choose Yanlord next time I travel.

Thanks to the experience ambassador Joy, for the warm and thoughtful service throughout the whole process, as well as small snacks and small gifts, which made me experience family-like care.

msg:Special thanks to Crown Experience Ambassador Avril for his full butler service, smooth communication, and help to solve all the needs raised! This is very good!
The following are some comments and suggestions after the actual experience of the stay:
@Check-in:
The overall check-in time is long, and the waiting time in line is 20-30 minutes. The experience is not very good. When checking in, someone will explain the parent-child activities. Although it is very considerate, it takes a long time. It is suggested that the explanation can be separated from the check in to reduce the waiting time.
@Room
 1. Bathroom
Unreasonable design: there is only one public door between the shower and toilet, which is inconvenient for multiple people to use at the same time
No special ventilation switch, ventilation is not smooth
 2. Room cleaning
The next day's cleaning, after knowing the number of guests, I didn't give enough bath towels.
@The whole hotel
1. There is no ventilation in the room passage, which is hot and uncomfortable
2. There are many people during the breakfast rush, and the meal is chaotic and noisy
Good tips
1. The concierge service is very good, helping you open and close the door and put your luggage.
   A garland is presented at the entrance, which is considerate.
2. The room service is very warm, delivering milk, snacks and crabs to children.
3. The parent-child activities are great, and the staff are very enthusiastic and dedicated.
4. The housekeeper service is in place. If you need to, you can directly deal with the housekeeper and be considerate.
5. Hotel pick-up and drop-off, duty-free shop pick-up service, great!
The overall experience was nice and would consider coming again.

The most laudable is the butler service. Suzy has been providing intimate and comfortable butler service since staying at Suzy. From the introduction of parent-child activities to catering arrangements, everything is carefully taken care of, and even the nucleic acid test on the return journey is reminded in time.

msg:Hengren Crown still gave a lot of surprises. At first, because of the large number of people, I waited for a long time. A waiter who I didn't remember his name helped me upgrade my room and gave me a welcome snack. The service attitude was super good, which gave the hotel a lot of points. Knowing that I was going to change hotels the next day, the housekeeper Nancy helped me with the waiter, helped me with a late check-out, made a reservation for a car to the next hotel, and most importantly, helped me and Edison advise , asked me to give me a hotel with a good view of the sea in the Addison. When I got to Addison, the crown's housekeeper, Nancy, was always telling me if the room was being cleaned up. It's so sweet, I'm sorry.

There are so many drinks and snacks from the minibar in the room that neither my child nor I could use it. Desserts and fruits are also plentiful. The executive courtesy, the afternoon tea in the VIP restaurant, and the light meal in the evening are just right, and it feels like you don't need to eat lunch alone. Breakfast is served in the VIP restaurant, there is no need to queue, there are not many people, and the food is relatively rich. Some noodles and rice noodles made by the hall can be taken from the main restaurant opposite, and the waiter also takes the initiative to help them.

The quilt and pillow in the room are good, and the wrapping is very strong. I think the hotel also provides many kinds of pillows, but the down pillow is very suitable for me. According to the housekeeper, it is a carnation.

There is also a surprise, which is not available in many hotels, and provides disposable bathtub covers and toilet covers. It's very friendly for someone like me who is a little bit of hotel cleanliness.

Paddle board activities for children are also good.

msg:Although I have stayed in a lot of star-rated hotels at home and abroad, Sanya Yanlord really exceeded my expectations. We stayed in a deluxe sea view family room. The housekeeper melody contacted me one day in advance and asked us if we needed to stay in the room. What extra things to prepare and what activities need to be reserved in advance for the children. At that time, our three children chose building blocks, and the small tent also had some extra hangers. All of them were properly prepared on the day of check-in. The children were very excited. On the same day, melody also warmly welcomed us and introduced us the various facilities and programs of the hotel. For the next four days, I will receive good morning greetings from melody and inquiries about what services are needed every morning. It is really considerate. to. The scene that left the deepest impression on me should be that the lifeguards are very attentive to accompany the children in the water fight while ensuring the safety of the children, so that the children can integrate into the activities more quickly. This is a loving picture. Both the service and the hardware facilities can be said to be very good, but the carpet in the room is a bit old, and it feels like it needs to be replaced. In addition, the price may indeed be high due to the high season. But I will continue to experience it next time, because the children have not been able to experience all the projects after staying for four days this time. The smiles of the children have not fallen off because the hotel is almost perfect. A parent-child hotel that both adults and children are satisfied with is the real thing. A good family hotel.

msg:Starting from the duty-free shop, I stayed at Westin, Edition, Crowne Plaza, and Atlantis for four nights. Each hotel has a different style and was built in a different year, so it is not easy to make a general comparison. The Crowne Plaza gave me the deepest experience in service and details, from the hand soap, laundry detergent, sunscreen, facial cleanser, floral water, mouthwash prepared in the room, and unlimited minibar, potato chips, seaweed, and mushroom power for the children. Breakfast can be packed and coffee can be taken away. This is really the first one! I saw two women at the next table using cold drink cups to hold fruits, and the lids of the cups couldn't be closed üòÇ The bath towels by the pool are always hot, and there will be a lot of drinking water and sunscreen on the counter for use. These humane places are rarely available in domestic hotels. Among the hotels I have stayed in abroad, only the Armani and Jumeirah hotels in Dubai have provided these unlimited services. There were some minor incidents when I checked in two days ago. The hotel manager actively communicated with us to solve them and sent a lot of things to the room. During the peak tourist season, it is inevitable that the service is not thoughtful, but the attitude of solving the problem is very good, and the guests will not feel uncomfortable, which is really commendable. The children's activities are suitable for young children, and the staff are very hard-working and dedicated. It is really hard work in such a hot day. It's just that the content of the activities is a bit **, and it is recommended to have more hands-on science activities. Water activities are still OK, and the atmosphere is very good! In general, the stay was very pleasant and relaxing, and the hardware and service matched the star price. I would choose to stay again!

msg:Many reviews are positive reviews. In order to let everyone see this real review, I will give it 2 points.
First of all, the price of staying is more than 6,000 per night. It is called the Supreme Sea View Room. On the first day and the second day, we arranged room 851. The room type is very poor. The rooms on this side are not worth seeing, very depressing and dark. The hotel There are only 12 floors for accommodation.
On the third day later, I switched to 810. The view was slightly wider, but it did not face the sea. This hotel says that only suites face the sea.
Here are a few points for improvement:
1. The lobby of the hotel is open. According to reviews, they don‚Äôt turn on the air conditioner in summer and it‚Äôs too hot. In winter, we checked out and waited for a car in the lobby for about 20 minutes. As a result, my daughter and I caught a cold because of the sea breeze. There is nowhere to hide in the entire lobby, even if there is no place to hide from the wind. What is the purpose of your so-called air convection? There is no need to turn on the air conditioner in summer and winter, it can only be said to save electricity. As for the lobby that made us catch a cold, my daughter said that she never wanted to go there again.
2. The air conditioner in the room is the most silent among all the hotels I have stayed in. As soon as you touch the balcony door, no matter whether it is closed or opened, the air conditioner will immediately cut off the power and turn off by itself. We went in and out of the balcony in a day, and we were so hot and dry countless times that we realized that the air conditioner was broken. What design is this? Have not heard. Many reviews also said that the room is equipped with an adaptive induction air conditioner, I am so laughing, what is the induction? Sensing your heat; automatically cool down? Or does it sense your coldness and automatically heat you up? The navy is too fake! Who would remember to turn on the air conditioner every time just because they opened a balcony door? Our whole family only found one reason, to save electricity bills!
3. In terms of room configuration and hardware in this hotel. Very average. Far from Atlantis. We lived in Yate before we came to live in Crown. There is no harm without comparison. Art is so much better. Yate's room is spacious and the equipment and hardware are very good. The crown room you see is 60 square meters, which is only possible with the addition of the extra irregular balcony. Not as good as Art.
4. The Yate twin room is equipped with a 1.5 bed, which is very friendly. However, Crown is a so-called parent-child hotel, and there are many online adverti*****ts, but the bed is only 1.3 meters, can it be changed to 1.5 meters? Really improve the check-in experience?
5. The drinking water provided in the Crown room is boxed, and you don‚Äôt know what to do with it if you don‚Äôt drink it after opening it. It‚Äôs really not practical. If you want to be advanced, use Evian mineral water directly, it is really advanced. Yate is served with real mineral water. The drinks in Crown's mini bar are only half of the variety and quantity of Yate.
6. The price difference between Crown and Yate is actually not very big, but Yate gives you tickets to two large and two small water worlds and aquarium tickets, while Crown does not have these, but he will give you snacks and some crab dolls, I think it is Some small favors. It's actually worthless. If it's a hotel worth a few hundred yuan, it's a plus to do this. But in a hotel of this level, if the hardware itself is not good enough, these small favors don't feel so important. There is also a Bulgari bath gift box. I would rather your hotel‚Äôs standard equipment is Bulgari bath products, which are much higher grade. In terms of details, the disposable shower cap is not equipped with disposable rubber bands for girls, but Yate has them.
7. Let‚Äôs talk about the service. The boy who checks in at the front desk is not good. He has no expression and no sense of service. We don‚Äôt feel at home. The butler service is better than the front desk. The best service may be the most tired restaurant waiters and room cleaners on the front line. This evaluation has nothing to do with the butler service, so the hotel doesn't need to blame the butler. After all, consumers are rational. At this price, everyone has their own requirements and opinions.
8. The children's heated swimming pool in the hotel has a slide and a half-hour bubble activity in the afternoon. This is what the children played in these 3 days. The other infinity pool on the 15th floor can blow you away if the wind is strong. Take a picture at most and punch a card. The other activities arranged by the hotel, my 7-year-old can no longer play. Suitable for under five years old.
To sum up, Yate has a total of 55 floors, the hotel has a good location, and the room has a good view. The 12th floor of the crown is a guest room, the location is average, and the scenery is average. We will choose Yate in the future. Crown will not come again. Crown small favors style is not for us. Instead of this, let's also match the hardware.

msg:This is the second stay after four years, and the experience is much better than before. Kily added me on WeChat the day before check-in and asked about the arrival time and needs. When I learned that I had prepared a birthday cake and decoration for my baby for my birthday, we also had cakes that were not finished that day. She helped me find a place to ice it and deliver it the next day. On the day of arrival, Xiaobao fell asleep. After getting off the car, the concierge pushed the car right away, which was a life saver! In the same situation at Park Hyatt before, I took my baby all the way back to the room from the underground parking lot, and the baby was 40 pounds. . So very emotional. All parent-child details of the hotel are perfect, even the toilet seat cover and children's sunscreen are ready. The room type we live in is too suitable for a family of four, with a two-meter bed plus a lower bunk, the same as at home. Children and adults alike slept very well. Also, the lack of a balcony is not a disadvantage, because 10 pieces of free laundry per day were given, and we happened to have a pile of clothes to wash. We can also see the weekend fireworks at Atlantis Resort from our room üéÜ. There are so many parent-child activities that there are no friends, but they can't take care of them all. Parents have to follow along. The swimming pool and gym on the 15th floor can see the super beautiful sea view, the wind is very cool and the wind is very cool. The breakfast is super rich. I must say one shortcoming, that is, there are too many babies and it is a bit noisy. The parent-child hotel is worthy of the name. Although Kily himself was not seen in the whole process, the service was perfect, and the response was super fast. Really, the whole stay experience was very good.

The Bvlgari bathing set as a gift and welcome fruit upon check-in is full of sincerity. Mouthwash, facial cleanser, toilet water, laundry detergent in the room are more than what I brought anyway. Strollers, children's toilet seats, bed fences, children's tableware, children's tents, toys of all kinds... they have everything you need. The waiter always sneaks in when you're not in the room, folds the clothes, folds the trash can, empties the bottled water, and refills the bottled water... Once I happened to be in the room, and the waiter came in to turn the night down, and I casually said that your jasmine tea bags are so good Drink, and after a while she sent me ten packs of [blushes] and then gave me a few extra packs every day. The coffee at breakfast is very good. The friendliest thing is that the staff at breakfast also took the initiative to help me put coffee into a take-out cup so that I can drink it and take it. Various activities from morning to night, like a super large kindergarten. In short, as the flagship store of IHG's parent-child hotel is absolutely well-deserved and worth recommending

Several nearby restaurants and recreational spots have been asked and no one found them. . We feel that the hotel is so big and there are so many guests staying during the Spring Festival, there is basically no hope of finding it back. I asked Melody for help with the mood of giving it a try, but I didn't expect that she found the sunglasses after just a few hours. Sunglasses may be small, but the heart of Melody and her colleagues to help us as much as possible is very important. Except that Melody not only helped us find our sunglasses, but her meticulous service, kindness and sincerity left our family of four with a great stay experience. We will definitely choose Crowne Plaza Haitang Bay again when we come to Sanya for vacation in the future, and we will also choose Melody as our experience ambassador again.

Last year, I added the hotel ambassador kiki WeChat before I stayed at the hotel. The people are very friendly and the service is very thoughtful. I contacted her before I moved in this year. Many problems can be solved before and during check-in, and the manager and other managers can feel their enthusiasm even though they don‚Äôt remember their names. Crowne Plaza Yanlord is the hotel with the best service I have ever stayed in.

I will not say anything if I ask for it, but I will also greet you whether you are sleeping well or not, whether it is smooth to arrive at the next destination after leaving, and the experience has risen to a new level. In terms of hardware, the footprint is indeed smaller, but the crown has really done enough in this land, so that we can't stop playing. The hotel's bars (both on the top floor and in the lobby) are commendable and well-priced. The infinity pool on the top floor is super filmed, so there is no need to go to the beach to take pictures. Get up at 6 in the morning and go to the top floor, you can harvest a large sunrise. The breakfast is too top, the variety is almost the same as the dinner. Desserts were also given on the last day, which was so touching. Please be sure to participate in the bubble experience every afternoon, it is too high.

msg:In my mind, the ceiling of the resort hotel for young and middle-aged children in Sanya! Hardware and software are excellent. Family room with bunk beds, the best choice with two children or an elderly person. The room I stayed in this time did not have a balcony, and 10 pieces of laundry service were provided per day, but because of the long laundry cycle, I only had time to wash it once in three days and two nights. I sincerely praise the activity depar**ent. The activities have ip, themes, and main lines. In addition to the passion of my brothers and sisters, compared with last year, this year has also changed new programs, new themes and activities, so that I will not get tired of it every year! The ambassador's service is still very good. This time, the ambassador suzy is gentle and considerate, and the service is thoughtful. However, from several experiences, the activities of ambassadors are often not recorded, of course, it did not hinder them, and they still successfully participated. This year, there are more activities for children over 7 years old, and it is appropriate to compete with the hotel next to the older children.

After checking into the hotel at 10 o'clock in the evening, the whole body was extremely itchy after waking up in the morning, but the customer service manager felt that they were fine, and they still needed to charge for the accommodation! Fortunately, the child did not use the quilt for the extra bed, and the guest couldn‚Äôt just give the quilt to the guest because of the high demand. After paying 8,000 yuan, I spent a day communicating with them about after-sales issues. I believe you are the only hotel where dead pigs are not afraid of boiling water. I am also very grateful to A Lin, the director of Ctrip, who has been helping to communicate! Parent-child tours are advised not to go, there are people everywhere and all appoin**ents are just decorations, so please think twice before proceeding! ! ! !

We went out to the hotel to eat and found an extra puppet. At night when I went to bed I blocked the side of the bed with a chair and we came back from breakfast to find that the bed surround had been installed. In the evening, we all came back from playing at the beach and found that the curtains had been drawn for us and the mosquito repellent had been inserted. Bath towels, water and sunscreen are provided wherever you swim. The hotel is very full of activities.

Under the scorching sun in June, it is impossible to take the baby to the outdoor children's play area and outdoor swimming pool during the day. It is too hot and too hot! The shape of the hotel is more distinctive, but the lobby is connected to the outside, if there is no wind, it will be relatively hot. The parent-child water play area is a few grades worse than the next-door Ate. The positioning of Crowne Plaza is still accurate. Prices and reviews are a bit high.

msg:When looking at the hotel, many of them were talking about family hotels, and we were traveling as a couple. I didn‚Äôt expect it to exceed expectations. Many small details were really taken care of by the hotel, such as some small decorations on the bed, and a bottle of red wine. . Send Bulgari hair care set, the fruit is too much to eat. I have nothing else to say about this service, give it a thumbs up.
 
Originally, the original intention of staying in this hotel was only for its balcony. There are many balcony hotels facing the sea, but there are very few balconies with large sofas facing the sea. Just lie down and look at the sea comfortably and feel the sound of the waves lapping. Surrounded by the chirping of birds and cicadas, and the comfortable sea breeze, I felt that this trip was worth it, and the other extras were surprises.

This breakfast, I think, is as rich and satisfying as the dinner buffet in other hotels.

The day before I left, I was asked what I was dissatisfied with. I didn‚Äôt feel it. When I have children, I will experience 100% of the hotel, see u

msg:Hotel location and transportation: The hotel is very close to the duty-free shop, and it is convenient to take a taxi. There are also airport shuttle buses. During the Chinese New Year, there are many people. It is recommended to increase the number of airport buses.

Service: We are greeted by Sofia, Hotel Crown Experience Ambassador
Enthusiastic service, especially efficient in dealing with the needs and suggestions put forward! Efficient! Arranged fruit, the service was great. Makes people feel very comfortable üåπ

The breakfast buffet is very rich in variety, and the appetite is also very good. Unexpectedly, the beef noodles are particularly delicious. I may rent Yanlord Crown again for this beef noodles.

It is recommended that all staff at the front desk need to improve their speaking attitude and facial expressions very much! I am a considerate customer. I feel that it is not easy for everyone to celebrate the new year, but the job is like this. If you choose this job, you must do your best to do it well. Moreover, the price during the Chinese New Year is also expensive, and the customer thinks it is worth it. Very important. Front desk staff still need training.

Suggestion 2 The taste of the dishes and the overall service level of the Chinese restaurant need to be improved. There are no pictures in the ordering menu, the guests do not know how to order, and there is no main dish. Although they have waited for a long time, the food they eat is unreliable. It's too late to order takeout again, so eating Chinese food is a bit laborious and disappointing. However, I also called in time to apologize and explained. I still hope that such an excellent hotel Chinese restaurant can be fully prepared before such an important Chinese New Year.

Hotel environment: The lobby is very beautiful, and the swimming pool is also very beautiful. The environment is very good. There is a water bubble machine in the swimming pool.
The trusteeship is also very well done, and children have different programs every day. If the adults go out, the children will be taken care of when they need trusteeship!

The best part of Yanlord Crown is that the problems raised by customers will be solved efficiently in the first time, and will be solved until you are completely satisfied. No one is perfect, I still feel moved to have such an attitude ‚ù§

I will definitely consider staying next time.

We came to Sanya to play hotels. We stayed in four hotels this time. We strongly recommend Yanlord Crowne Plaza with our children.
Now let's talk about the details, there is a warm welcome garland when you enter the hotel. There are themed activities for kids at different times throughout the day. The pools are all heated, so don't worry about the kids getting cold. Mineral water is available everywhere, no need to buy it.
There is also a drying rack on the balcony, where swimsuits can be dried and posted.
We ate breakfast and dinner at the hotel. The quality is very good, the fruit is fresh, and the lobster is all you can eat. I don't want to eat lobster anymore. There is also a children's restaurant if you are hungry at noon.
The conclusion is all kinds of good things. Children play well, and adults live happily!
Sanya will stay again next time.

msg:Avril, the Crown Experience Ambassador before check-in, took the initiative to contact him about any requirements for the room and others. When you arrive at the hotel door, you can feel the warm hospitality from the moment you enter the door. As soon as you enter the door, you will be sent a garland to lead you to check in. Then the housekeeper Avril will introduce the details of the entire hotel facilities and parent-child activities in detail, and you will receive two cups of Starbucks coffee. Redeem on the 15th floor of the hotel, and also gave a drink coupon for the lobby bar! There is also a fruit gift upon check-in. The hotel's parent-child activities are very rich, and the queue is full from morning to night, and the point is that there is no need to pay extra. There are a few items that can be reserved in advance. Very satisfied with this! The hotel's breakfast is from 7:00 to 11:00, which is suitable for taking children out, so you don't have to get up early to rush to have a late breakfast. My daughter likes to participate in activities in Qilin Illusion the most. The ladies and sisters are very enthusiastic. The activities are also very colorful and different every day. And the environment is very good! Let's talk about the hotel's swimming pool, the infinity heated swimming pool on the 15th floor is quite good. And you don't need to bring your own swimming ring, the hotel can borrow it. The next day, the housekeeper Avril also prepared snacks and fruit for her daughter to deliver to the room, and also took the initiative to ask when it was convenient to clean the room. Intimate [Hey Ha], next time I will choose Crown Yanlord and I will recommend it to friends!

msg:The Crowne Plaza Hotel has been planted with grass. This time, the last two days of the holiday are arranged here. The children are very happy. When they leave, they always ask to stay for a few more days...
When entering the store, we were received by the experience ambassador Kily, a super gentle and beautiful lady, who carefully introduced the activities and layout of the hotel children, and arranged for us to rest in the reception hall while the room was still being cleaned. It was our birthday and we didn't inform the hotel in advance. , also arranged birthday arrangements and cakes, and contacted us at any time to ask about the check-in situation and any help needed, and sent us a beautiful macaron meal the next day, which was very considerate!
It is worthy of being a must-stay hotel for parents and children. There are many activities for children. Although there are not many activities to play this time, the hotel's breakfast interaction, bubble pool activities, and even the 270¬∞ heated swimming pool all make children linger...
Will continue to stay next time!

Husband and son are very satisfied~ The Bvlgari washing sheath that I sent also smells so good. The balcony of the room is very big, and the sound insulation is also very good. There is a bubble party at 4 o'clock in the afternoon every day. The kids had so much fun! Thanks to every service staff of Yanlord Crown, and July's caring service! Compare your heart!

There are also hotel activities for children in the picture. The food is delicious. Children exercise themselves and have fun. There is also childcare service.

There are many children's programs, but many are not suitable for older children. But I especially liked the Ultraman game console, the eldest son was crazy.
The Bulgari gift box is very touching.
What needs to be improved: the toilet door can't be pulled, and the switch has no night vision function.
Generally speaking, it is comfortable to take the baby to live in Yanlord

msg:The well-deserved king of parent-child popularity, it can be said that he considers everything for children. But as many people have said, babies that are too small are not suitable. My family is over two years old, and many activities cannot be participated. If they are older, they may experience more happiness. One or two-year-old babies only need to be with their parents. Together, getting close to nature, digging sand, treading water and running on the lawn should also be very happy. I don‚Äôt think the baby is too young to need a parent-child hotel, just a family of three to enjoy the holiday quietly.
First of all, there are really many people in the lobby, all of them are children. Two-to-one is the easiest, and there are two-to-two or 3 or 4-to-two. It's nice to see the children smiling happily, but because their cubs are young, they still have to be careful everywhere. After all, children don't care as much as adults when they play.
It is understandable where Yanlord's high score comes from after moving in. It is really attentive. It may not make you feel like a fairyland as soon as you enter the door, but there is really no deduction for the experience, and the overall humanistic care All are in place, butler service is also serious and responsible. Our housekeeper Kelly began to introduce the facilities and services in the hotel seriously since we had not received the room card, and then also very thoughtfully asked us any special needs in advance. Say hello every day, ask when the room needs to be cleaned, and if there is anything missing or needing to be added. Because of her presence, I was able to fulfill all requests without having to contact anyone in the hotel. When we checked out, we carelessly left the baby's clothes in the room. The guest room notified me on the same day. After transferring it to Kelly the next day, she helped to send it home. During the busy work, she also helped us deal with the follow-up. Things, although a little sorry, but more thank you.
Speaking of the overall facilities of the hotel, there are two different theme children's parks, both indoor and outdoor to meet the needs of different babies. There will be children's cutlery and bibs on each table in the restaurant. The breakfast content is very rich, and adults and children can enjoy breakfast very well. The family set menu ordered by the children's restaurant is also very large. We just left more than half of the afternoon tea, and I feel a little heartache ‚ïØÔπè‚ï∞ There is also a children's bathroom in the restaurant, and I feel that everything is designed for children. You can set up a small tent in the room where you like. If I was a child, I would probably like to stay in the room and play. If you need a children's toilet seat and heightening pedals, you can also prepare them. They are all free items. The list of specific items that can be provided for children is shown in the figure. When I returned to the room in the afternoon, I found that there was a thoughtful good night milk for the baby at the head of the bed.
In general, the title of parent-child hotel ceiling is well-deserved, and it is more suitable for babies over four years old. There are many details that have not been written due to limited time. Parents, please bring your babies to find out.

Favorite points: the balcony is comfortable and the view is good. Bubble pool praise. Travel photography is worth a try for families who are not good at this, the photographer guy is very nice. The butler service is very good, it can do pre-thinking, meticulous and considerate, kelly cheers. This time the meal is also a classic, because there is no homework, so there are surprises. Chef + ingredients + foreman, all three are very rare. There are definitely regrets and deficiencies, but in China, it can be ranked first in my heart for the time being. It is a pity that the three major negative factors of Haitang Bay this Spring Festival: strong wind + cooling + poor duty-free shop experience still make the whole trip flawed.

The housekeeper Kiki has always been responsible for assisting with various needs during the hotel check-in process. Other staff have also been trained and managed very well. The whole feeling of the hotel is very generous, with many staff and sufficient equipment.

Here is a particularly touching detail. I took a 3-year-old child to swim in the rooftop pool alone at noon on the 31st. The water is hot and not cold for swimming, but the wind is relatively strong. It was a little cold when the water came out. The little girl from the staff found out and ran to us in a 100-meter sprint with two towels. It was incredible, it was really a 100-meter sprint! Such management and staff are really awesome, I sincerely respect and thank you for your service.

If there is anything I don‚Äôt understand, I will directly disturb her through WeChat. I am very patient and make me feel full of security throughout the process. Thank you again!

msg:The hotel is very good, suitable for family travel, and there are many activities throughout the day. Nancy at the front desk called and added WeChat the day before our check-in and asked us if we had any needs to talk about. Every day we checked in, he would send various reminders on WeChat. Service is very good.
The breakfast is very rich and delicious, richer than the Westin next door. There are also baby eating bibs. Friendly staff and very attentive service. It is worth its price, after all, it is three or four thousand a night near the Spring Festival.

There is a constant temperature infinity swimming pool on the 15th floor. It is very comfortable to swim in it in winter. Children are reluctant to get up. It is windy when they get up, so they need to wrap a bath towel immediately.

The hotel is very close to the seaside, not far from the lobby is the seaside beach. The hotel also has a large constant temperature children's slide, which is constant temperature. Children have a lot of fun here every day. From 4:00 to 4:30, there are bubbles queuing up, which is quite high.
Anyway, will stay again next time.

msg:Heard of his name for a long time, but has not yet entered, Crowne Plaza Resort Sanya Haitang Bay Yanlord
The address of the hotel is located in Haitang Bay, quiet and quiet, near the duty-free shop. It is suitable for buying and buying. It is far away from the airport, but you can reserve the hotel‚Äôs airport shuttle bus for free.
The main body of the hotel is the shape of a ship, and every room can see the sea! Our room is a supreme sea view room, the room is quite large, and also presented with red wine and Bulgari toiletry set; the balcony is super large, lying on the sea breeze Very pleasant.
The hotel has many swimming pools. The 15th floor is an infinity pool with a 270-degree ocean view. The scenery is great, but the wind is super strong and it can be a bit cold; there are several large and small swimming pools on the first floor, and the photos are also very beautiful.
The hotel has direct access to the beach. Haitang Bay has relatively big waves and cannot go to the sea, but the hotel provides tools for playing with sand. Big friends like me also like to play haha.
The lawns and coconut groves on the beach are particularly beautiful, especially when the sun is good, the shadows of the coconut trees are projected on the lawn, great!
The only minor disadvantage is that the hotel is mainly for parent-child hotels. Most of them are family N with children. It may be a bit noisy for two people to vacation.
This experience ambassador July's full service can be said to be meticulous and perfect. All your needs, what you want, she can appear and solve the problems in the first time, praise it seriously!

It is worthy of being ranked first among parent-child hotels. , All kinds of small details make parents feel relieved, such as bathtub covers, including the next door Yate also not ~ all kinds of intimate snacks, and welcome gift boxes, also very close to the duty-free shop, the whole scenery is very good ~ anyway, all kinds of satisfaction, Will come to live next time üòä
The only thing is that Haitang Bay has big waves, and you can only play in the sand on the beach~

msg:The hotel is generally very good. The duty-free shop directly rides a shared tram or taxi to the gate of the hotel. It's very convenient to walk. It is very friendly for children over 3 years old and under 7 years old. But under 3 years old. Older children may be bored. The hotel‚Äôs swimming pool children are very fond of it. Don't want to get up at all. The only regret is that there is no hotel‚Äôs own private beach. . . . There are too many businesses on the beach. Sometimes it affects mood. The overall service is really good. Our two little friends. All the service staff in the hotel are very patient. But I think the hotel facilities are average, and the exhaust air from the toilet and bathroom is too small to feel. Sometimes it can be embarrassing. And hope to add a night light of that kind. Every light in the room is turned on, which will affect the children. Turning off the light will affect the eyesight of adults watching the TV and the phone is too dark. . . The Chinese restaurant is delicious. But eating twice is enough. Children's restaurants are more suitable for children. Everyone knows something about adults. The buffet is very rich. Especially when the festival is dazzling. . I also beg everyone not to go to the aquarium in Yate. . I am not a childcare. . But it is really an IQ tax. . . It didn't take half an hour to read it all. The only Beluga whale who wants to touch is not in a good mood because of the maintenance of his pool. Haven't seen it yet. . The staff said that getting along with dolphins and seals can go to the water world. But you have to buy a ticket to enter the water world. Touch the small animals on the island and continue to give money. . It doesn't matter if you live in Yate. If you really want to go to the aquarium, please go to Changlong or your own provincial capital city aquarium is definitely better than his. . . There are many photos of the hotel. It's all about the same. So put some Chris**as Eve buffet.

The service has nothing to say, bad, this I didn‚Äôt want to kneel down with my family. I was really satisfied to try the crown. I went there and helped me upgrade to the "Supreme Seaview". I also got a birthday cake by the way. The cake is of high quality and not fooled. I saw it by the way. They disinfected the children‚Äôs play area after the completion of the work. The ancients said that working hard in places that cannot be seen or heard is the real effort. The buffet delivered is also good üëç
   Of course, there is no such a perfect hotel. Let‚Äôs talk about a small problem. Outside the lobby of this hotel and part of the amu*****t area outside, the wind is really very strong in this season. My analysis is still caused by the narrow air duct. This is not very Convenient, after all, the outdoor swimming pool (not too windy) does not know when there is a gust of wind, it is indeed a bit cold.
All in all, it's not bad. The service of the butler Ai Mi Li is very good. Sooner or later, I feel cold and warm. Sooner or later, it really feels like a family member!

Children‚Äôs activities here fall from morning to night‚Äôs bedtime stories
One after another, dizzying
There are rare projects that children over 9 years old can play
But most of them are more suitable for preschool children‚Äôs projects.
We chose paddle board, snorkeling experience and making dim sum
The children had a great time playing,
It‚Äôs dark before dragging into the room to change clothes for dinner [covering face][covering face]
Special thanks to the experience ambassador, Miss Kiki, who is beautiful and caring. She asks for warmth every day and sends us a little surprise.
I sent small snacks to the room at supper time last night, it‚Äôs so heart-warming [Áà±ÂøÉ][Áà±ÂøÉ]
The room is also equipped with infrequent facial cleanser, laundry detergent, sunscreen, etc. Although the hardware is not up to the high five-star standard, the software is definitely above five-star.
The only regret is that the whole hotel will have less holiday a**osphere due to the strong parent-child a**osphere
Because here are basically people who come to walk the baby [smile][smile]
Those who want to walk the baby can consider here

As for service, the vast majority of employees are warm, polite and responsive. I was very touched that the store allowed early check-in and upgraded the room type at my request. But individual employees are far from satisfactory. For example, the attitude of the front desk staff is indifferent, expressionless, basically coping with errands; the female lifeguard in the infinity pool on the top floor has a bad attitude, and even finds fault with provocative behavior, which makes people feel extremely unfriendly. Other aspects, such as the decoration and configuration of the room are generally good, but I don't know what brand the coffee is, and it's hard to drink. Another thing is that the landscape swimming pool is closed at 6 p.m. under the pretext of epidemic prevention. This is not as good as MGM Hotel and Fairmont Hotel. The latter is also in epidemic prevention, but the swimming pool is closed at 10 p.m. Finally, there are many children in the hotel, which is a bit noisy. It seems that non-parent-child travelers are not suitable for staying.

I went there for the first time during the epidemic last year and brought people from my unit. I liked the a**osphere and environment very much at that time. At the end of the year, I brought my family and found that I had an experience officer üòÑ. I took the initiative to add our WeChat and opened up three days of meticulous care and care. This time, it came again. Suzy helped us arrange the room. Although it was raining intermittently in the past two days, it did not affect our good mood at all. Yanlord Crown is a hotel that is definitely worthy of unlimited return. Perfect!

But during the National Day buffet dinner, 428 alone is really not worth it, after all, it can be understood during the festival.

The children's playground is the best I have seen in all hotels in Sanya. The playground has indoor and outdoor playgrounds. Two parts, can be fully discharged after dinner. During the day, there is an area full of green plants for participating in the children's project, which is very fun. The breakfast is rich and there are lollipops, and the dinner is also very casual. There are more than a dozen kinds of snacks, all of which are delicious. The most intimate thing is the welcome drink, and red wine can also be packed in the room. It is too friendly to the mother who can't get out of the child after sleeping. Our housekeeper, Sandra, is beautiful and welcoming, and gives us various arrangements. Also sent afternoon tea and travel shots. In short, this hotel is the Haidilao among Sanya hotels, and the service experience is not one of the best.

Ask whether we need all kinds of services, or whether the room facilities are complete, or help us with late check-in. Until we checked out, we still cared about us and asked if we got home safely. The concern during the stay is work, and the concern after check-out is character. I should choose again next time I go! It's a pity that the baby is less than two years old, and there are too few projects that can be participated in. I hope that we can add more, suitable for the baby. The little train did not arrive either, so I left some regrets for the next time.

Beach üèñÔ∏è: The hotel is super close to the sea, and there are super rich sand digging toys for children at the entrance of the beach, which is super worry-free.

There is also a special comfort, whether it is the swimming pool, beach, or room, lobby, there are bottled water everywhere, to add water to the children in time, not to get angry-staying for 4 nights is too satisfying, it is worthy of a high-scoring parent-child hotel with a baby Love to live.

We ate brunch together every day, and it was almost eleven o'clock after eating. There is a children's restaurant. The children ordered a pasta, but the taste was not very good. After only a few bites, they stopped eating and went to the room to order takeaway. By the way, the takeaway here is also very convenient. The basic taste is not bad.

msg:One person took the baby to Sanya and stayed in two IHG hotels, one is the big brother Kaaba Intercontinental in Haitang Bay, and the other is the upstart Yanlord Crown. They are all hotels under the IHG banner, and the comparability is relatively strong. In terms of service attitude, Yanlord Crown is really good. I used to think that the good comments on Xiaohongshu were all brushed up. I only felt the high score of 4.9 after staying for 4 days this time. It was earned by the hotel staff with a serious and responsible attitude. When I checked in, the housekeeper Nancy added WeChat to me. In the next few days, no matter what I have, I can respond quickly and propose solutions. Although Yanlord does not have many advantages in terms of hardware compared with other five-star Haitang Bay, it is better than the newer rooms. The compact layout is actually quite convenient for my old mother with a baby. No matter eating or playing, I don‚Äôt have to walk too much. Far. The slides and abundant activities in the children‚Äôs pool are really amazing. My son was two years old, and he found out the layout of the hotel at once. He called the room home every day. He cried for a long time on the day he left and said he didn't want to leave. I think the attitude of the child is the most representative of everything. If I bring my children to Sanya next time, Yanlord Crown will definitely be my first choice. Finally, thanks again to Nancy and the administrative corridor manager for their care and help these days.

She communicated with various depar**ents and basically met our requirements. Is so touched! When we arrived at the hotel, Ben and Paul, who received us, gave us a detailed introduction of various facilities, and we can consult them in time if we have anything to do. All the staff in the cafeteria are great! The dishes are brought to the table for us.
2) Facilities: The rooms are large and clean; all the toiletries are for adults and children, and they are also equipped with sunscreen, toilet water, etc., which is really sweet!
3) Food: The breakfast is very rich and the seafood soup is delicious; the quality of the buffet in the evening is also very good, the grouper soup is too delicious.
Love the service and food of this hotel. The wrong point is because it is a parent-child hotel, there are too many children, too noisy, like to come quietly and carefully.

Stop writing, it's all in the photo.
The hotel environment is tall, everything is good, and the service is particularly good. Ctrip's 5-star rating is really not imaginary. Special thanks to our experience ambassador Suzy, who is very caring, and sister Liang Guixia, who is responsible for the hygiene of our room, is also very serious and responsible. Perfect journey, happy memories. Bring the baby must live, good value for money, come next time!

The 2-year-old son directly soaked in the pool and refused to come out. I don't want to eat or sleep, I just want to swim. Hahaha. When the sun is big, you can go to the infinity pool on the top floor. If the sun is not too big, you can go to the open-air swimming pool or children's pool on the first floor, as well as travel shooting services. Breakfast is even better, only you can't think of it, you can't eat it without you. The only regret is that I didn't get to the little train that my son loved the most. Next time you visit Sanya with your parents and children, you will also choose Haitang Bay Yanlord! !

Once the child cried unhappy, the aunt cheered the baby, so heart-warming
One more thing, at first I thought that the public areas of the hotel were all open, without air conditioning, and it was not cool. Later, I found that this design is very caring for the babies who return to the room after playing in the water. You don‚Äôt have to worry about the air-conditioning letting them.

The baby is relatively small, and many of the amu*****t items in the hotel are not experienced. The sea and beach are indeed not as good as Yalong Bay. There are no deck chairs and the sand is not fine enough, but the baby is enough to play in the sand.
The breakfast is rich, and the utensils and bibs for the baby are also very complete.
Atlantis can be seen from the balcony of the room, 1 km to the Aquarium and Duty Free City.

msg:This trip was relatively temporary. The cub was 1 year old and 4 months old. I was thinking about visiting the sea for the first time. The child is too young and has limited mobility. The hotel is most suitable. Through multiple hotel selections, Yanlord is the best choice. It is basically a high-tech parent-child hotel recommended by Haitang Bay, and it is also relatively new, so I booked it for 2 nights. . When I arrived at the hotel, I was upgraded to the superior room type. I was happy~ After I arrived at the store, I waited for the room to be disinfected for almost 30 minutes. It was a very fast check-in. The room was large and the sea view on the 11th floor was very beautiful. The service has a special experience ambassador, Melody Chen, who can be contacted by WeChat during the entire stay. The reply is fast, the work efficiency is high, and the service is very considerate. Let‚Äôs make an overall summary of Yanlord during this stay: 1. The service is thoughtful and considerate. It is great to clean the room twice a day; 2. Children‚Äôs supplies are available, such as tents, building blocks, bathtubs, etc., and they are also included. Have snacks for children; 3. Long breakfast time, 7-11 o'clock, the meals are very rich; 4. Near the sea, there are tools for children to borrow on the beach. The conclusion is that Yanlord is really too friendly for children, especially the small cubs, the hotel is comfortable and suitable, adults are not tired, and children are happy.

‚òÜThe most praiseworthy thing is the service of the hotel, what a wife! The butler Lena received us from our check-in, and added WeChat to contact us at any time, answering all questions and requests, almost always reply immediately, too awesome! In addition, the other staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic.
‚òÜBreakfast: The variety is too rich! ! ! There are five types of boiled noodles and vermicelli, and they taste very good. The grilled pork chops are super fragrant... During the 7-11 meal time, friends who like to sleep late will have lunch directly!
‚òÜExecutive Lounge: We booked a suite with full sea view and enjoyed the courtesy of the hotel. The executive lounge is open for free from morning to evening, 7-11 breakfast, 14-17 afternoon tea, 1730-20 dinner, unlimited soft drinks , Starbucks (exactly the same as the ones sold outside), it's so comprehensive!
‚òÜChildren's activities: from morning to night, there are different styles every day, and the kids will have fun in the hotel! There are three swimming pools on the first floor, as well as a semi-indoor 270-degree ocean view infinity pool on the 15th floor. Both the children's pool and the infinity pool have a constant temperature of 32 degrees. You can also arrange swimming if you want to swim in the rain!
‚òÜLocation: Right next door to Atlantis. Fortunately, Atlantis was not selected. There was too much traffic. The noisy lobby made us turn around and left. The beach is very close, the sand is very fine, there are no broken shells and dead corals, and the beach shoes I brought are useless. It is also very close to the duty-free shop. The hotel has a shuttle bus, which takes only two or three minutes to drive. It is super convenient.
‚òÜSummary: It is a caring and thoughtful hotel very suitable for children. I give full marks to the experience of staying üíØ! It is a hotel that allows me to stay and want to stay again, and I want to stay every year after staying! I also hope to keep it going, it has been so great!

Stayed for two days, all details were taken care of very thoughtfully. What impressed me most about the hotel was the breakfast. The richness made you think it was a dinner buffet. It is not an exaggeration to say that one meal is enough in the morning and noon. The hotel has a standard swimming pool and a children's pool. The night water gun battle and bubble battle in the children's pool make adults and children very happy. The hotel has also thoughtfully set up many courses suitable for children to participate in, and parents who are happy with their children can also take a rest. I especially like the 5% discount at the hotel‚Äôs spa and duty-free shops, which is a plus! Finally, I would like to make some suggestions. The current entertainment facilities are more suitable for children under the age of 12, and older children may be able to participate relatively less. But service is indeed the business card of the hotel! In addition, the swimming pool and gym on the 15th floor have superb views, so don't miss it.

There are drinks and snacks in the room every day, and I can't finish it. There are mineral water and bath towels everywhere in the hotel, and the breakfast variety is also very rich. The bubble party is especially attractive to children. I hope that there will be more projects for older children next time. The housekeeper Nancy's meticulous care and service every day made us very satisfied. We would reply promptly to any questions at any time. She was very considerate and gave the children two hotel mascots before leaving. The hotel‚Äôs airport shuttle bus is also very convenient, I will choose here next time, thank you

msg:We stayed in three hotels for four nights in an InterContinental hotel and one night in Atlantis. I asked the children which one they liked the most. She said that she loves Yanlord Crown, the scenery is beautiful, the beach is close, and there are many pools. If you ask me the reason for choosing Yanlord, I like her outdoor bar the most. It is very comfortable with the evening breeze, drinking cocktails, lying down and listening to music and playing on the phone. In the night of July, I couldn't feel her heat at all, but some were just comfortable breeze, which I liked very much. There is also a drone shot by Yanlord, absolutely

msg:In addition to being a bit more expensive, the playability of items suitable for adults is not particularly high. Overall it is well received. Children love their bubble time so much. The infinity pool is a very good experience. The hotel‚Äôs sense of birthday ceremonies and cakes for children are very good. Climbing lifeguards are also very good. If they can be equipped with a person to stay there all the time, every time the child wants to climb, he has to wait for the lifeguard to come over, and there is no way to climb if the lifeguard is not there. The child is a little unhappy. There are plenty of fruits and drinks in the hotel, and the sunscreen and facial cleanser in the hotel are really great. The pool is also very clean. The customer service lady Bella is also very good.
There is a small suggestion, that is, the outside swimming pool hopes not to be filled with the best, because we are a little scared when we are short swimming inside. Then I hope that the opening time of the swimming pool can be advanced to 7 o'clock in the morning, because it is only open for swimming at 8 o'clock. At that time, the sun is really too big, and suntan can be directly tanned. But it‚Äôs good that the little brother of the lifeguard also swam for us in the end, haha. In short, I will go again if I have a chance~ I would recommend it to other friends

msg:Room facilities:
The room is very large, with two 1.2 beds and a double bed for children. The second-child family sleeps casually. The bed under the bunk bed is still 1.5. Four people can‚Äôt sleep. Hahaha. The room has a full range of children‚Äôs toys and a minibar. Drinks and snacks are free, and the waiter will refill it in time after eating
The bedding is very comfortable, a sink, a disposable bathtub cover for the bathtub, and alcohol sanitizers are provided on the toilet and the table. Under this epidemic environment, it suits my taste and makes people feel at ease. However, the sofa in the room is made of fabric. So the obvious stains are still visible to the naked eye
Children‚Äôs toiletries, toothbrushing cups, toilet water, facial cleansers, mouthwashes, and sunscreen lotions are all provided. It‚Äôs really complete.
breakfast:
The breakfast is very hard core. There are several restaurants, and there are also special children‚Äôs restaurants. The western restaurant has the most variety, which can only be described as awesome. Chocolate waterfall, ice cream, steak, and the quality are all very good. I have seen the world. Feel great
At the breakfast entrance, there are staff in the dining room who are distributing masks and always reminding everyone to wear masks when taking meals. Epidemic prevention is more than just talking.
The fruits are cut in small pieces and are suitable for children. All kinds of flour are available, and the key quality is not sloppy. This is really not easy.
There is an infinity pool on the 15th floor with a beautiful view
The room design should have sea views. The family room I booked is Atlantis and the sea from the window, and you can see the water world
The hotel staff are well-trained, and they will take the initiative to greet you when you meet, and ask if you need service. The children‚Äôs amu*****t facilities are disinfected at any time by the staff, which makes people feel relieved
There are free beach tools to borrow by the sea, and you can return after having fun. The coconut grove in the hotel is super suitable for taking pictures. It‚Äôs so beautiful
Both the downstairs swimming pool and the top floor swimming pool can rent bath towels, swimming ring armbands, and unlimited mineral water
Butler Ava is also responsive, saying that the air conditioner blows on the bed, and in the middle of the night, he asked me if I want a technician to adjust the room. I declined because the children had rested. The service was really lacking. It was more than five thousand one nights when I stayed. Bulgari has a good experience, and you must stay here next time you come to Hainan

Picture one picture two, the child slept in this suite all night. I have a rash on my body. The hotel did nothing. Because the suite could not be booked the next day, we changed the bunk bed room. A string of blood dripped on the room sheets. From the guest room to the manager, the hotel has been evading it by ourselves. Dare to ask which guest would have such a mental problem, sprinkle a few drops of blood and add a block to their vacation? ! If it wasn't for the children, they must live in the bunk bed of your hotel. I checked out today! I will never live in the crown anymore. An employee has not changed his sheets and made a mistake. The leader only knows to put aside his own responsibilities and obliterate the efforts of the entire group. Resolutely bad reviews! It's always good when there is no problem, but when there is a problem, the management is in a mess! That's it!

The distance between guest rooms, restaurants, swimming pools, and beaches is appropriate, which will neither influence each other nor travel far. The hotel‚Äôs facilities are complete, the Chinese food is good, and the breakfast is good, but the western food needs to be fueled. The best thing the hotel does is service. The butler, Melody, started to help arrange and coordinate before moving in, and even arranged birthdays for the children; he would take care of us every day and respond to requests. In short, it is a very suitable hotel for children, and I will stay in Sanya next time.

msg:Take a family trip with your baby, I highly recommend this hotel! During this trip to Sanya, I stayed at three parent-child hotels (Skyland, Atlantis, and Yanlord Crown). Regardless of the environment or parent-child entertainment, this one is the most satisfying! Let me talk about my personal feelings: First of all, Tianyu has been in business for a long time, the hotel facilities and environment are relatively old, and the rooms are a bit old. There are two swimming pools for children's amu*****t. There are a lot of people, and the water quality is average (my daughter said the water is smelly). There are also many amu*****t projects that require additional fees. The better aspect is that the hotel‚Äôs recreation area includes the beach, with a lot of large-leaf olives planted, and the sun is quite good, not too sun-dried. Atlantis, I really told everyone that it is more like a vegetable market, there are too many people, and the aquarium is relatively small. If you want to play aquarium in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, go to Haichang! The water park is not very big. I really want to buy tickets for it, I don‚Äôt need to stay in a hotel. Although there are unlimited times in and out of the aquarium, it is enough to visit this aquarium once. The hotel's breakfast is quite rich, the restaurant is very large, there are two restaurants for breakfast to choose from. There is no place to dry the clothes in the hotel...The last staying in Yanlord is the most satisfactory. The service is not to say, but the housekeeper Bella is very considerate. During the renewal, because the room type is different, I will be upgraded to the original room type for free. Always ask what you need and where you are dissatisfied. The room type selected this time has a very good sea view. The room is very large, clean and tidy. The snacks and drinks in the minibar are replenished every day. There are welcome fruits. The laundry detergent is also thoughtfully prepared. There is also a double-layer drying rack on the balcony of the room. thoughtful! The children‚Äôs activities in the hotel are also very rich, and they are free, so the children don‚Äôt want to leave. In addition, the hotel‚Äôs breakfast is also very good, and I will take my baby to the preferred hotel in Sanya in the future!

The bow faces the east and the stern faces the west. There is an infinity pool on the 15th floor. It is especially suitable for watching the sunrise in the morning. Unfortunately, the clouds on the second day of my stay were a bit thick and I didn't see it. The stern of each floor of the hotel is open, and you can see the sunset and sunset directly at the hotel. In particular, the infinity pool on the 15th floor is particularly comfortable, soaking in the water has an invincible view of the coastline of Haitang Bay, and the view is very open. You can watch the fireworks show of Atlantis Water World at 9 o'clock every night, super clear. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast buffet is from 7 am to 11 pm. At around 9 am there are very many people at the peak. It is recommended that there are a lot less people to go after 10 am. The food is also very rich and will be served until after 11 pm. Most of the guests staying in the hotel are with babies, and there are a lot of second babies, so there are a lot of parent-child activities and entertainment facilities. Parents can safely put their children here and play with their own children. We drove here by ourselves. The hotel has a free underground parking lot, which is very convenient. I highly recommend this hotel, it's great, I will choose again in the future.

Yanlord‚Äôs room is relatively large and very clean, and the balcony is also large. When you look out, you can see the blue sea and sky, which makes people feel happy instantly! There are 4 or 5 swimming pools in the hotel, and they are also very large. They are the favorite of children. The hotel has its own private beach, but the wind and waves are big, so you can only step on the water twice, not swimming. Go out of the hotel door and walk straight on the sidewalk on the right for about 10 to 15 minutes to reach the largest duty-free shop in Sanya. However, many cosmetics are out of stock. Sisters who are going to have to do their homework in advance and find someone to collect 3 of them! Another 15% off! ! ! Next time I have a chance, I will definitely come again!

Don‚Äôt worry about oversleeping and not having breakfast. After staying in so many 5-star hotels, Crowne Plaza may have room for improvement in hardware. , But the humanized service has increased the hotel score a lot. Sure enough, the impression of a hotel has a lot to do with the attitude of the hotel staff. I met a local driver on the road and said that he had carried several batches of guests. They all said that the Atlantis next door had a poor service attitude, and the staff inside quarreled with the guests. I'm so thankful that I didn't choose Atlantis! Next time I come to Sanya, I will still choose to live in Crowne Plaza!

In contrast, children prefer Yanlord Crown, and it is highly recommended for babies aged 3-6 to stay.

After comparing several hotels in the surrounding area, I chose Yanlord with distinctive personality. Because I decided to travel temporarily, the price of one night is more than 3K, but it is excellent value for money. The appearance of the entire hotel is full of personality. Outside the hotel, there is an exclusive beach. The blue, the sand is fine and clean, the children are all having fun, breakfast, lunch and dinner can be settled at the hotel. The Caifeng Building of the restaurant we selected tastes authentic and delicious. Because I only stayed for one night in a hurry, I really didn‚Äôt know what I wanted.

They like to go to the executive lounge quietly. The shape of the hotel is particularly beautiful, the location is in the central area of Haitang Bay, 5 minutes away from the duty-free shop, and the self-driving car is also very convenient! We stayed in a suite with full sea view. The customer service max is very good and the service is very good. It can help me think of a lot of points to note. I know that some children have added a fence to me. They are attentive and thoughtful. They also laugh very sweetly. The cleaning lady every day Everyone asks us what we need to add~ It's a very nice hotel, there are too many areas for children to play. Parent-child must choose, come back next time!

msg:Before the beginning of school always want to take the baby out to play, because the baby is too small, think for a long time before deciding to go south, bring the baby to the beach to play.
Hainan played for 10 days, the last stop to Haitang Bay, staying at the Crown Renheng.
It's really Haidilao in the parent-child hotel.
The service was really good
The private housekeeper Dios has a great service, and is well informed,
If you have something to do, wechat calls the housekeeper and feedback is very fast.
1. Every day, mini-bars are replenished with various drinks and snacks.
PS: After eating, my baby still wants to eat a box of chocolates cookies, told the housekeeper, immediately sent two boxes.
2. Send a large fruit plate every day. After we finished eating the bananas in the fruit plate, we asked the housekeeper for one and the housekeeper sent a new plate.
3. Room, pool, beach. They have everything baby needs.
Children's items can be borrowed in the room: stroller/children's dining chair/bed enclosure/incremental bench/children's toilet/bath, etc.
There's a bathing suit, armband, warm towels, mineral water.
There are various sand digging tools on the beach
So taking the baby to Renheng is really a relief
4. Room Service
Clean twice a day, the housekeeper will ask you the appropriate cleaning time, avoid our rest point, and will come to clean before bed. If the room is dirty, you can also call the housekeeper to clean.
I like it best: There are waiters on the pool and beach. They bring hot bath towels, mineral water, even sunscreen.
I almost wear a swimsuit and go there, but I don't need to bring the others.
5. Breakfast
Too rich, how can there be so many varieties, taste is also how good.
Stayed in a lot of hotels at the same price, breakfast was really as the other sisters said, very rich
	
Cons: Restaurant is relatively small and expensive. But it tastes very good. Chinese restaurant and children's restaurant are very good.
Indoor parent-child paradise is the children's club and the magical landscape of Qilin is too small.
Luckily close to Atlantis, you can go along the beach for a while.
The two beaches are connected, it's only 10 minutes walk from the beach

It will help you make a reservation for you. Explain what you don't understand. Help me upgrade the room for free. I will come to deliver my luggage personally. The mobile phone is in water because of Atlantis. Also help me find out where there is maintenance and where to buy a mobile phone. The details are very good, I will find her next time. I also sent a child's hand gift, the WeChat reply is very fast and has a question and answer, the hotel is very suitable for children, the children are very happy. Atlantis is cheaper and will choose the Renheng crown next time, the children play more.

You only need to bring personal items, clothing, and other things, laundry detergent, Mosquito repellent water, sunscreen, beach toys... all things in the room are free. I brought my children to Children‚Äôs Day this time. I had a lot of fun. There are many facilities and activities for children. There are mineral water in many places in the hotel. There is no water to drink, the room has enough water, fruits, and snacks. There are too many fruits to eat on Children‚Äôs Day. There is milk every night. I also want to thank the kiki beauty for the snacks. The children are very happy and your enthusiasm The service touched me. I have been contacting me during vacation. I have a good meal at the hotel, a comfortable stay, and the night is very quiet. There are many types of breakfast. There are ice cream buffets. The kids love it. I will come again next time. It‚Äôs a happy Children‚Äôs Day, great!

When checking in on the next day, I reconfirmed whether including dinner. The front desk said that the system was stuck. It will take a while to confirm. Check in first. Wait until 6pm, but it has not been resolved. The front desk will be pushed to the restaurant. ? The business processing ability is so bad? Finally I found the manager to solve it, it was too disappointing, bad review

msg:Under normal circumstances, I rarely comment. This experience is really bad. First of all, the airport pick up is at 14:00 and our plane will land at 13:00. Tell us to wait until we arrive at the airport parking lot at 13:45 and wait for us to arrive on time. The airport pick-up vehicle drove away and returned after half an hour of communication. At this time, we took our children and waited in the hot airport parking lot. Later, I called the hotel to say I was sorry and there was a need to tell them. Originally I thought the attitude was okay, even if I didn‚Äôt complain, we had to go to the airport from Haitang Bay two days after we left, hoping to take a ride at the hotel. As a result, The hotel informs that they can no longer take their car after they have left the store! Secondly, the so-called key services are far from the Renaissance Hotel. Besides, parent-child activities are basically simple activities involving water fights and handicrafts, and there is not much content. Some children's game consoles in the hotel are not only charged but also very expensive! In short, under normal circumstances, I will not make a negative review, but this time the experience is really not worth the price.

The rooms simply do not reach the five-star level, which is the Holiday Inn Express level. In a five-star hotel, there is no air-conditioning in the corridor public area, can you believe it? The service is very average. The so-called children‚Äôs swimming pool is even more pitiful. Generally speaking, the hotels that are hyped by the media are all IQ taxes that come to stay.

The waiter directly swipes his card to enter and put down the fruit. Can such a low-level mistake be made? The solution afterwards is to treat us to a meal? Imagine that you saw a male waiter in a hotel taking a shower to relieve your breath after a meal? ?
