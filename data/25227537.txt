msg:The Marriott hotel in Yantai is one of the best hotels in Yantai. It has an incredible view of the ocean, and sits on the ocean boardwalk, making it very easy to go for morning runs or evening strolls.

The hotel uses many light colors in its decorations so the hotel and the rooms feel open and bright. The atmosphere is calm and peaceful. 

The rooms are clean, and the beds are comfortable everything you would expect from a Marriott hotel .

Unfortunately, the room was a bit cold. I had to wear long sleeves and a jacket in the room. Also, except for the amazing omelettes, the breakfast is lacking.

But I have stayed at the Yantai Marriott in the past and will stay there again in the future.

msg:This place is a real gem. Yantai city is not the most interesting place to visit, but if you are looking for a private, relaxing, and pampering experience, this hotel will satisfy those needs while not costing a fortune. The queen room we originally booked was not suitable and I wouldn’t recommend it. The bathroom is not separated from the bedroom by a real wall, and instead uses a “privacy screen” to obscure a direct view of the toilet. This of course helps to make the room appear bigger in photos. We immediately upgraded to the suite which was a massive improvement for only a couple hundred RMB more, which was comped by daily access to the executive lounge where buffet dinner and alcoholic drinks were served. Location is amazing. The new economic zone is arguably prettier than either penglai or Yantai. The beach is pristine, and seemingly is only used by hotel guests. Several acres of scrub forest divide the hotel from the main roads, giving you a feeling of real isolation from the outside world, and in China that’s very rare. Staff were great. Room was always clean. Food and services were on point. Would book again!

However, the room was very tight, and it was Baoshuan who helped us communicate actively, so that we could stay in the original room and avoid the trouble of "moving". He was very considerate of us.

Baoshuan also gave us pear soup and biscuits for our children, which were already on the coffee table when we checked in. This was very warm.

The view of the sea view room is particularly good, and the endless sea is displayed in front of us without any obstruction.
The blue cheese for breakfast is quite authentic, and the coffee is also delicious.
Marriott prepared a bath bag for us, which is very thoughtful.
The mattress, pillow, quilt, and mattress pad are all very comfortable.

msg:I went to Yantai with my family and booked two sea view rooms on Ctrip. When we checked in, the front desk arranged us on the 11th and 15th floors respectively. We asked the front desk if we could be transferred to the same floor so that we could take care of each other. The front desk said that we could not be transferred because there were too many guests in the hotel, so we had to give up. When we opened the door and entered the guest room, it happened that the hotel room manager Shi Yaxing came to greet us and delivered snacks and drinks. At this time, we mentioned the room arrangement to Manager Shi Yaxing. Manager Shi immediately said that she would coordinate the matter. In a short time, Manager Shi arranged the room transfer properly and transferred the 11th floor room to the 15th floor, so that our family could take care of each other very conveniently. During the stay in the hotel, Manager Shi was also responsive to all requests and questions, and personally arranged for us to extend our stay. Manager Shi treated guests like family members, was full of enthusiasm and responsibility for work, and we were very moved by the arrangement of this small matter. Her work attitude is really hard to meet in the hotels we stayed in when we traveled around. Therefore, we specially wrote a letter of praise when we checked out, and praised Manager Shi again to express our deep gratitude! 
The hotel is in a great location, with an endless sea view, very vast, and excellent scenery!

msg:Traveling with a baby (the baby is only one year and eight months old), we were told that the room had no balcony when we checked in the executive twin room we booked, and then we paid the difference to upgrade to an executive room with a balcony. The balcony faces the sea and the view is pretty good, but the room area is not very large and the balcony is relatively small. We informed the check-in staff in advance that we needed to arrange a quieter room. It was inconvenient to bring a baby and we were afraid of affecting others, but we still arranged it next to the executive lounge, which was not very satisfactory. Later, the administrative lady said that we would arrange a change, but the baby had too much luggage and was too lazy to change. Fortunately, there were not many people in the executive lounge and the noise was not very loud. The babies slept well at night. There was no baby fence, and the staff helped to move the chairs to block it.
The room card took a long time to get on the first day of check-in. We took the baby to lunch and urged for a long time before it was delivered. The experience was not very good. (Lunch is Cantonese dim sum on the second floor, fortunately it is relatively light, rice noodle rolls, beef balls and wontons can be eaten together by the dolls, chicken feet and spare ribs are relatively hard and not soft)
The executive lounge has light meals and afternoon tea in the morning and evening, with quite a lot of varieties and they are all very light. Bring the dolls here to eat some fruit before going out after waking up. Three meals can basically be solved here. Clean and hygienic, it solves the most headache problem for mothers, and the children can eat with peace of mind. In addition, the ladies in the executive lounge are very enthusiastic, especially Miss Anna, who smiles and speaks very gently every day, and her mood will be better when she sees them. She will help the dolls to get up when they fall down, and give them snacks every time she sees the babies, and patiently prepare warm water for the dolls. The two children chase after them every day and call Aunt Meimei. They really like the aunts. After dinner, they rest on the sofa and let the dolls play by themselves, which is super worry-free.
It is a three-minute walk to the beach. There is a foot bath downstairs of the hotel. The front desk provides sand digging tools, which is very user-friendly. There is a small children's play area on the second floor of the hotel, which is a bit too small for us and suitable for younger babies.
The hotel is a six-minute taxi ride away from AEON, where food, drinks and entertainment are quite complete. It is a ten-minute taxi ride away from the lonely whale check-in point, and there is an outdoor children's play area on the left.
Overall, this trip was quite pleasant, and the most satisfying thing was the service staff in the executive lounge. All mothers with children must upgrade their room types.

Hygiene: There is no need to emphasize the hygiene of the old hotel. The hotel's self-inspection procedures are very good. Although it is an 18-year-old hotel, it is well maintained in the city with sea breeze.

Environment: Sea view rooms must have balconies! Getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning to watch the sunrise is completely different from running out! After watching, go back to sleep! When the sun is too strong, it is suitable to sit on the balcony and drink tea and coffee!

msg:1. The room is very nice. We upgraded to a balcony sea view king room for free. It faces the sea. We also told you that you can watch the sunrise over the sea if you get up early (but I slept too much because the curtains block out the light).
2. Very friendly to babies. They send a bottle of pear juice and a muffin every day. After knowing that there is a baby making milk powder, they directly sent a free bottle of mineral water.
3. It is very considerate to have a bathtub and a bathtub cover.
4. The restaurant has a good breakfast service and can help heat up the food in the evening.
5. The small garden downstairs leads directly to the sea. If you don't go to the city center to check in, the downstairs is enough to play. The hotel is a little remote, but it is convenient to take a taxi.
Disadvantages: There is no baby fence. Our baby fell under the bed🥲, and there are no rented sand digging toys

Going downstairs and passing through the garden is the seaside, and the clear coastline is very beautiful. Yantai's luxury list of beautiful scenery is not in vain. The hotel facilities are high-end and a**ospheric. There is a popular spiral staircase on the first floor, which is very photogenic. There are many landmark buildings worth checking in nearby, and the surrounding scenery is beautiful. I will choose here next time if I have the chance!

1. It is very close to the beach and can be reached on foot without cars. The Hilton Hotel next to it requires crossing a big road to get to the beach, which is not safe for children. 
2. The beach quality is relatively shallow and suitable for playing in the water 
3. Although it is not a hotel-exclusive beach, the beach is relatively sp****ly populated 
4. The buffet is five-star standard 
5 The sound insulation of the elevator room may be a bit poor 
6. The swimming pool is not big, enough for children to play

msg:Because I drove from Shanghai and arrived at the hotel late, I was assigned the last room. Strange things happened:
1. The room is slanted, and the bed is also slanted, which means that the whole person has to turn left 20 degrees. Yes, you read it right. It is hard to imagine that there are slanted rooms in the hotel, and the front desk did not inform me when checking in!
2. The room area is different from the Ctrip page, which is obviously smaller.
3. The lighting design is very unfriendly, the light is too dim, and it still looks like a bar when all the lights are turned on. The hotel explained that the expensive rooms are brighter. Well, brother only deserves to live in dim rooms.
4. The superior sea view room has only half a window. The legendary invincible sea view is just a prison design on the seaside?
After discussing with the hotel and Ctrip for nearly an hour, the attitude of handling is completely different.
Hotel: No refund, after reporting twice, only agreed to change the room, because it was close to midnight that day, we agreed;
Ctrip: repeatedly emphasized that it had brought a bad impact on our experience, made three calls to apologize to us, and also gave us cash compensation.
I can only say that attitude determines everything!
I will never stay at Yantai Marriott again. My impression of Marriott Hotels has been greatly reduced.

msg:I started choosing hotels in March and changed them three times. I gave up again because I didn't buy tickets. Finally, I chose Xinguang Marriott. The overall experience of staying during the May Day holiday was very good. I chose an executive double bed. The lounge food was good. I read the comments saying it was too simple, but my family thought it was good. I didn't want to dine on the second floor with my children. The executive lounge faced the sea, it was quiet and clean, and the variety was good.
The room size was also suitable, the cleaning was timely, the swimming pool and the gym also faced the sea, and the experience was 95 points. The only dissatisfaction was that the mini bar in the executive room was charged, and the sliding door and balcony door in the room could not be closed. I told the staff to repair it later, and it broke again the next day. I hope it can attract attention.
There is a beach and Tianma Bridge outside the hotel, and the children had a lot of fun.

The hotel has an exit directly to the beach behind. There are not many people, the sea water is clear, and the sand is comfortable to step on. You can dig live shellfish and crabs. It is a relatively popular attraction. You can walk and play on the beach. It is very suitable for vacation.

I ordered a bottle of signature🍶 Kikunoka sake and Lanqi Chufu🐋. I can eat as much as I want of Matsuba crab🦀, which is very delicious🦪. The overall cost-effectiveness is high.

Thank you Anna Yu for your enthusiastic service and immediate response. She quickly helped solve the pillow problem.
The crispy chicken and roast goose in the Chinese restaurant are good. I hope to come again in the future.

Thanks to the front desk for patiently introducing the room. The cleaning lady was full of energy and greeted me as soon as she met me. She truly interpreted the hospitality of Shandong.

msg:Because I value the hotel's unbeatable sea view, I booked here and stayed for two days. Overall, I was very satisfied and comfortable.
I booked a deluxe sea view double bed room with a balcony. When I opened the door, I could see the refreshing light blue sea and golden beach. The sound of the waves was so healing. I also felt it was worth it to have a single flush with the sea view.
The temperature, humidity, bedding, etc. in the room are all Marriott's usual standards. The sound insulation is also okay, and I had a good rest.
The service is also very heartwarming. The aunt who cleaned the room accidentally took away my glasses case, and the manager on duty specially bought a new one for me, which really made me feel at home.
If there are any shortcomings, there are some problems with the water pressure in the sink and bathroom. Once it is turned on, it is easy to spray everywhere. In addition, the toiletries and restaurant ingredients and varieties are still far behind those in first-tier cities, and there is still room for improvement.

There are abundant entertainment, shopping and dining options around it. Because it is relatively remote, you can enjoy the quiet and clean beach. Marriott's services and facilities are always online. This time we were upgraded to an executive suite for free and enjoyed very thoughtful and considerate services in the executive lounge, especially Anna Yu who followed up and paid attention to our needs throughout the stay, which was very good. In short, I will choose Marriott again when I come to Yantai again.

The room is also very clean, and the facilities and equipment are well maintained. It has not aged at all after being opened for several years. It can be seen that the maintenance master has really worked hard. I like it. When I was waiting for the elevator, I met an employee named Shi Yaxing who took the initiative. Ask us about our stay experience. Every detail in this hotel is evident. We will come here again next time.

I am also very grateful to Miss Demi at the front desk for her thoughtful arrangements. Thank you very much🙏I stayed here by chance before. My wife and I had a good stay and my wife recovered very well👍so I decided to come here again, probably with this place. The aura is harmonious. The luckiest thing is that I caught up with the snow. Although the snow was short-lived, it was the first time I saw the snow scene on the seaside. It is not a beautiful word that can be described (see video).

The key is that it is right next to the seaside and across the small garden is the golden beach. The old man and the old lady fed the seagulls all morning. When checking in, the service provided by Gerg Liu, the lobby manager, was super good. He clearly explained the buffet discounts for attraction services, and also gave small gifts with Yantai specialties to the elderly. Needless to say about the hardware, Marriott's "software" is still guaranteed to be better than other stars. . From now on, whether traveling for business or traveling in Yantai, this Marriott hotel will be your first choice.

Her enthusiasm and professionalism made me feel very considerate. When I checked in, Ms. Pumpkin noticed that I was tired from the long journey and took the initiative to upgrade me to a more superior room with a better view. This attentiveness and thoughtfulness made me feel warm and like I was being taken care of by family members.
Speaking of rooms, I must praise the room design of Yantai Xinguang Marriott Hotel. The room I was assigned to had a wide view and a direct view of the magnificent sea. When I wake up every day, the first thing I see is the sparkling sea. This beautiful scenery makes me happy and makes me full of expectations every day.
In addition, the hotel's breakfast is also a highlight. The rich breakfast varieties meet the needs of different guests. Whether it is traditional Chinese breakfast, Western bread, milk, or fresh fruits and vegetables, every taste is carefully prepared, fresh and delicious. It is undoubtedly a pleasure to start a new day with such a breakfast.
In general, Yantai Xinguang Marriott Hotel not only has a superior location, but also has meticulous service. Every employee has demonstrated extremely high professionalism and service enthusiasm, so that every guest can enjoy a distinguished and comfortable accommodation experience. Whether traveling for business or leisure, Yantai Xinguang Marriott Hotel is a recommended choice. Looking forward to coming back next time and continuing to enjoy the first-class service and beautiful sea views here.

msg:The busyness at work a few years ago made me nervous and exhausted. So I quickly "escaped" after paying New Year's greetings on the first day of the new year. I randomly chose a coastal city and a coastal hotel. When I got off the bus, I complained that I didn't look carefully at the location. Why was it so far away, but I stayed for one night? Later: "Extend my stay! I want to extend my stay!!"
Jim at the front desk was professional and enthusiastic. I booked the wrong room for personal reasons. I wanted to stay with a sea view but mistakenly booked a garden view. When he learned about it, he immediately comforted me and said he would try his best to satisfy me! It didn’t take long for me to get the good news: “I can change it to a sea view!”
There is also a Northeastern lady in the guest room. I don’t know her name, but she is also very enthusiastic and actively helps us debug the TV screen projection problem. She also folded our pajamas for us when tidying up the room~
The purpose of this trip is to relax, the living environment is important, and the service is still important even though it is an add-on. I sincerely thank every service staff at the hotel for making my trip relaxing and comfortable...
Happy New Year! Pay tribute to every staff member on duty!

msg:I took my parents-in-law and relatives to book a total of five sea view rooms. First of all, the room has a wide view and you can see the blue sea while lying down. The room is large and has a bathtub. The important thing is that each bed in the twin room is 1.4 meters. The big bed is super comfortable!
Hygiene: Cleaning is very timely and clean! We live on the 17th floor, and the service girl is super enthusiastic. Not only does she respond to requests, but she also trots there! Give her a thumbs up!
Facilities: Very complete, every detail is taken care of, there is also a gym and swimming pool with a view of the sea. The water temperature is so great, my little grandchildren went crazy!
Environment: I am very satisfied. The hotel lobby is quiet and clean. It is very comfortable to sit and chat with family and friends!
Service: Needless to say, every staff member is warm, thoughtful and responsive!
Thanks again to the staff member named Xiao Wu at the front desk in the lobby. I temporarily added a room that night. This gentleman patiently helped me search and booked a room with a satisfactory discount! This hotel is the most satisfying five-star hotel I have ever stayed in!
The hotel's breakfast buffet is also great, with a dazzling array of Chinese and Western food and beverages, making it difficult to choose!

msg:"Affordable" Marriott with ocean view~

When booking a room, I also looked at the Hilton and Westin near Golden Beach. They are all hotels under the same group, and I finally chose this one because I like the Marriott's ocean-view terrace.

This Marriott is located near the development zone, 30 minutes from the airport and about 40 minutes from the city. Please be careful when taking photos here.

The lady at the front desk who checked in was very enthusiastic and helped me change to the room type I liked. Special mention goes to Devie Liu~ she is kind and kind. She helped me carry my luggage and walked me to the elevator.

When we arrived at the room, it happened to be low tide, and we could see people rushing to the beach from the balcony... It was very lively, the sea water was clear, and the beach was very clean... It's very suitable for taking children to play ~

The room is quite satisfactory, the quality that Marriott should have. But the restaurant is very artistic... There are three small bubble-style outdoor private rooms on the square downstairs. At night, with the lights on the square, it is very artistic. The restaurant also has a seat overlooking the sea indoors. The dishes are very rich and are a combination of Chinese and Western. There are pizza, pasta, and Yantai special fried shrimp cakes...

I highly recommend this affordable Marriott hotel with a view of the sea. It is a good choice whether you are traveling for business or vacation!

Facilities: The hotel has complete facilities. I really like the decoration style of the hotel. The spiral staircase in the lobby is said to be the hotel’s internet celebrity check-in point. It is indeed very eye-catching.
Service: The service is impeccable. The staff at the front desk of the hotel were very enthusiastic when they arrived. When they saw the children coming, they took the initiative to give them a toy car. The children were very happy. The floor staff will take the initiative to say hello, which is very warm.
Hygiene: All locations in the hotel are clean. You still have to choose a five-star hotel to stay. The sea-view balcony is very comfortable.

Because there is an accompanying rental car with me, I registered at the hotel, and the parking is free. There is a large AEON shopping center 1.3 kilometers away, which is very convenient for shopping and eating. There are chain brand restaurants and coffee shops. I originally booked a double bed room, but the front desk saw that I had brought my eldest son with me, so they directly changed me to a twin bed room, very considerate. It is very close to the Tianma Trestle Bridge and the Golden Beach. I mainly have a rented car to accompany me. I think this location is very suitable. It's a pity that the hotel seems to have an amu*****t park, which was being upgraded when I went there, so I didn't experience it.

msg:I had been doing research for a long time, and the overall positioning was higher than Sheraton and Hilton. I came with the expectation that I would have a comfortable stay even if I spent a little more money. Unexpectedly, I came across the hotel with the best service and the most cost-effective hotel I have ever stayed in! ! ! !
Because we booked for 2 days through different channels, Pumkin Gao (Gao Yuan) at the front desk was very considerate and helped to upgrade the second day to the same room as the first day, which was great! And seeing that there were children, the staff specially sent several bottles of water, a sand digging set and a car toy. The items delivered by express delivery were in the express locker outside the hotel. After telling the concierge, they helped us get the express delivery to the hotel in 5 minutes. The entire service was really full of details, sincerity, and super great!
Let’s go back to the executive lounge. It’s just afternoon tea and dinner. What’s more, the hotel’s swimming pool and indoor environment are the best choices on the Golden Beach. Next time you come to Yantai, look for the Xinguang Marriott!

msg:This is the first time I came to Yantai. I mainly chose Yantai Marriott Hotel because I wanted to be closer to the beach. The hotel has a parking lot, so it is very convenient to come by car, and it is close to the beach. It is very suitable for catching the sea, playing in the water and watching the sunrise. When we arrived at the hotel, the hotel manager Cui upgraded us to a deluxe sea view room for free, and gave the child a set of Peppa Pig's sand digging tools, which the child loved very much! Entering the room, I was immediately amazed. There is a balcony in the room, and you can see the sea from the balcony. We watched the sunrise on the balcony the next morning. It was so convenient that we didn't have to go downstairs! Breakfast was a buffet and was a pleasure. The hotel has a disposable bath bag for taking a bath. It also provides small drinks and desserts. There is also plenty of mineral water! From the first floor of the hotel, you can go directly to the beach. The sand here is thin and soft, and it is very comfortable to step on. We caught several small crabs with the sand dredging tool provided! When catching the sea at night, they thoughtfully turned on the headlights! During the stay, I asked Manager Cui about recommended places to eat nearby. He was very enthusiastic and careful. He recommended many places to us, and he also thoughtfully marked that some restaurants do not eat spicy food. Do not go there, and the recommended places are places that locals often go to. , so you don’t have to worry about being ripped off! I went to the swimming pool and gym in the evening. The gym is open 24 hours. You can enter by swiping the room card. The swimming pool is open until 10 pm. The water temperature is very comfortable, and there is a shallow water area of ​​1 meter, which is very suitable for children! Overall, I feel like this stay was really great. I recommend staying there! Special thanks to Manager Cui for his warm and attentive service! And all the staff in the hotel!

msg:The hotel is very close to the sea. Most sea view hotels are actually across the road, but Xinguang Marriott does not have it. The real downstairs is the beach. The sea view executive room has a viewing balcony with a wide view. The slight disadvantage is that the balcony is relatively narrow, it would be better if it is wider.

The beach downstairs of the hotel is the best place to watch the sunrise on the sea (but not the sunset), it is very beautiful.

Special 👍 Barry Gao in the executive lounge, the service is courteous, enthusiastic and modest, adding a good memory to this trip.

From the greeting when we checked in, to knowing that we were going to the beach, we specially put children's bathrobes in the house for the children, and extra bath products, all of which reflect Xiaocong's care and thoughtfulness. After checking out, the child suddenly thought that he had lost his deciduous tooth in the hotel, so he quickly contacted Xiao Cong. Xiao Cong hurried to the room to search carefully, and finally helped us find it and wrapped it layer by layer carefully. The child said that he would stay at the Marriott in the future.

On the second day, the housekeeping depar**ent replaced the pillows with moderate hardness. Thanks to the housekeeping supervisor Shi Yaxing and cleaning Yu Zhiying for their thoughtful service, I set up a small tent for the children in the room and gave them some snacks. When I checked out today, the children were still in the tent and refused to leave.
       I eat in the executive lounge every night, and the quality is as good as ever. The staff in the executive lounge, Barry Gao, is very enthusiastic and thoughtful, thank you.
       There are many types of breakfast, but there are more people, it is best to stagger the peak meal time, there is an outdoor buffet every night, the fee is not expensive, and the price is high.
      Very satisfied with the staying experience, next time I come to Yantai for vacation, I will choose Marriott again!

The golden beach below has clear water, shoals, and golden sand. It is especially suitable for young children to play. We didn't catch up on the weekend, and there were very few people in the morning. The beach was chasing the seagulls all the way, and it was very happy.
Children like the electric four-person bicycle at the entrance of the hotel the most. It is super labor-saving, and the beautiful sea view with few people along the way is pleasing to the eye.

There is a lawn buffet in the evening. UU, the lady at the front desk, is really friendly and helpful. She upgraded our room for free and gave us a lot of gifts for the children. Thank you very much! If I have the opportunity to go to Yantai again, I will choose the Marriott Hotel again!

msg:After searching on the Internet for a long time, I found that this hotel has a balcony on the Golden Beach, but you can only choose a deluxe sea view room, and the deluxe sea view room does not have a balcony. Priority will be given to those with balconies only after booking and calling and requesting remarks from the hotel. After actually looking at it, there are only a few rooms without balconies, so it's not a big problem.

Environment: The balcony has an invincible sea view, overlooking Tianma Zhanqiao and Bajiao Harbor. There is also a private beach, not many people, quiet and comfortable.

Facilities: Chinese-style design, newer and more modern than Hilton and Sheraton.

Service: There is a takeaway cabinet for takeaway, which is very convenient. The coffee and slippers requested by the hotel were delivered to the room quickly. Parking is also very convenient, registered the number to the front desk, unimpeded.

Cost performance: high, the price is generally high in peak season, but compared with other ordinary hotels, next time I will stay at 5 stars

Suggestion: It would be nice to have a free breakfast (only one breakfast is included in the reservation); the swimming pool is disinfected and cannot be used, and some discounts or gifts should be given to customers to make up for it.

There is a qualitative difference between sea view rooms with or without balconies! The hotel is right next to the sea, and it takes only 3 minutes to get there. The sea water is also very clear, it is a magic weapon for vacation! The room is very comfortable to live in, and the hotel facilities are also good. I will choose to stay here again when I come to Yantai in the future!

🌳The service is impeccable, except for the food and beverage depar**ent. The brother Allen at the front desk is warm and generous, very efficient and professional enough. The bartender service in the lobby bar is also very good, but the wine is hard to describe. The breakfast was particularly chaotic...but the relevant person in charge responded and apologized. It's a pity that there is no forwarding phone number.
🌳The location is very good, the beach is just outside the door, and there are many things to do nearby.
🌳The sanitation is impeccable, the decoration of the room is quite new, even if it is better, it can be branded as a ritz.
Overall, I highly recommend this Marriott, if it is around Golden Beach.

It’s a blessing to be able to enjoy the sea breeze on the balcony of the room~ From living to eating, the price is very affordable. The a la carte restaurant tastes very good and the price is not expensive. Next time you don't need to go out to find a restaurant, just stay comfortably in the hotel. Thanks to Allen Zhang for his warm and thoughtful service, who took the initiative to give us a free upgrade. The fly in the oin**ent is that there are weddings in the downstairs garden, and they are still singing with loudspeakers at almost 10 o'clock in the evening.

One little regret is that the hotel does not have a children's playground, and the children have no place to play. We were unlucky to catch up with the cloudy and rainy day, and it was very cold and we couldn't play at the beach.

I went to multiple platforms to see the strategy and finally chose this one. It’s really great. The hotel is only about 27/28 minutes away from Yantai Airport. Secondly, the hotel is very high. The 16th floor we stayed at this time has a good view. If we can live on the side facing the sea, it should be more perfect. You can go out from the back door of the hotel to a platform with an excellent environment. After that, there are steps to the beach where you can play in the water. You can see the sea from the sand, and there is a foot washing facility at the back door of the hotel, which is really considerate. The hotel has a constant temperature 28° swimming pool. Male and female guests also have separate sauna rooms. Toiletries are readily available. The bathtub in the room provides disposable bathtub bags. The bath salt is also very thoughtful and I am really satisfied. You can check out the next day without touching the front desk and put the room card in a check-out box next to the lobby and you can go. It is very convenient and it will become the first choice for future travel.

msg:This room type faces the sea and listens to the sound of the waves. The hotel is luxurious and high-end, with the pattern that a five-star hotel should have. The service attitude is good. Turn left 100 meters from the hotel and there is a nucleic acid sampling point, which is very convenient! But the carpet in the hotel room is dirty, there is only one box paper in the room, and the quality of the paper products is relatively poor. The security of the hotel suggested that we put the car in the underground parking lot. The elevation of the entrance of the parking lot is 2.1 meters. After driving in, we almost reached the entrance of the hotel lobby on the negative floor. There are several rolling gates that cannot be opened. My Land Rover Defender has a high luggage rack. Can't get through at all! Fortunately, the brakes in time. The hotel is located in a new area, and there is no old Yantai city style. Find a place to eat and drive for ten minutes. There are no residential shops nearby.

msg:I was thinking of two nights in Long Island and two nights in Golden Beach, so I only booked a sea view room for two nights. Later, when I saw that a typhoon was coming, I booked a garden view for two days, but my sisters Zoey and Demi at the front desk said the two I was upgraded to sea view at night. I was so happy. I stayed in a sea view room for four nights to watch the typhoon passing:) The hotel does have its own beach, which may be a matter of season. It's quite big, and the configuration is satisfactory, but maybe it's a common problem in all hotels . It may be a little embarrassing 😳 The breakfast is good. The breakfast for a family of three is double that of being at home. The waiter and sister are also very friendly and help make coffee every day. The dishes made in the Chinese restaurant are also delicious. Stepping on thunder is slightly inferior to the seafood buffet. The shellfish are cold, but the small cakes are delicious. During the epidemic, the swimming pool and gym have not been opened. I have no experience. Oh yes, the security uncle at the door also looked at me enthusiastically. When I rent a car, I keep reminding me to record the car carefully so as not to be pitted. All in all, it is very good and in line with expectations. Recommended

Even if there are many people, the hotel's various services are very thoughtful ~ especially thanks to Miss Demi at the front desk ~ when we checked in, he helped us coordinate the room and also helped Notify roommates to send all kinds of necessary accessories.

Scan the health code, after scanning. When checking in at the front desk. Encountered a very disgusting thing, the thing is like this, the front desk asked our family to do a cigarette accounting, saying that we can do it by turning left 50 meters out of the door. I say why. Our family's nucleic acids are all valid within 48 hours. He didn't give any explanation. I went out to carry a small bag. Nucleic acid is off work. Fold back again. Ask a guy in the lobby with a red armband. Epidemic prevention written on the armband. He said he didn't know and let me ask the concierge. Ask the concierge. The concierge also said he didn't know, so he asked the front desk. We were ruthlessly tricked in this way, and the hotel wrote on Ctrip that it would hold for 48 hours. Medium and high risk areas will not be accepted. Ask the hotel if you have any questions. The hotel called me to ask what time I would arrive before I checked in. It was not clearly told that nucleic acid should be done after arriving in Yantai. The hotel's concierge. Check the epidemic prevention personnel, the front desk, basically all decorations. After complaining later. Here comes a man who calls himself a leader. By his own admission. No post-arrival nucleic acid is required. This hotel is completely playing with the people. A couple of young men who went upstairs with us. dragging suitcases. Nor did they do the nucleic acid after arriving in Yantai. The rest of the. All can. No one accepts except empty plates. The rest are ok.

After coming here, this mood is completely gone. From the moment the door is opened, you can feel the breath of the sea. Be sure to book a sea view room. You can overlook the sea and the sky when you lie on the bed. It's really beautiful. The cleaning aunt is very enthusiastic and responsive. Many scenic spots are very close, and the breakfast is very rich. Although there are a lot of people, it does not affect the dining experience. I do not pursue a few people in a deserted hall. In the lively a**osphere, everyone shared the feeling of this trip. I went to Long Island for three days, but to be honest, it is recommended that families with children do not have to toss. They are all by the sea. The sand of Golden Beach is the best, and there is no need to experience the so-called different seasides again and again. Next time I come back, I will definitely be at Marriott Permanent residence.

msg:I made a strategy in advance and said that this is the best hotel in all aspects of Yantai's seaside, and I booked it for three nights without hesitation.
In the golden period of summer, the hotel business is super good, there are no vacancies every day, and the price is also expensive.
The advantages first:
1. I booked a deluxe sea view king-size twin room. The two single beds are 1.4 meters each, which is considered large. Downstairs is the sea, the view is good. And compared to the nearby Hilton, it is quieter, you don't have to cross the road to go to the seaside, and there are fewer busy people.
2. The service attitude of the staff is good. For example: After we came back from playing outside the next day, we found that the two tea cups were not washed. After we reported it to the waiter, the waiter apologized repeatedly.
Areas that can be improved:
1. Stayed for three nights in total. On the first night, I was given a room at the end of corridor 7029 because I arrived late at the hotel. There are three super large air conditioner exhaust outlets downstairs. As long as the doors and windows are opened, a very loud exhaust sound can be heard. And the size of this room is so small that it can't fit anything except two beds. And we entered the room at 21:30 and found that the sliding door of the bathroom was broken. At 22:00, the master came to the door again to repair the sliding door. The next day I moved to 1709. The room is big enough to fit a sofa. The facilities are also good, and there is no rumbling noise.
2. The bathroom design is very unreasonable. Privacy and sound insulation are not good. If you only want to open a door to enter the bathroom, it is very easy to hit the bathtub and hit your thigh. This is a flaw, and it seems that the hotel cannot change it at present.

msg:When I arrived at the hotel, I found that the hotel I booked did not have a balcony. I booked the hotel after seeing the super invincible sea view balcony. The hotel staff told me that I booked this room type. Without balcony and without floor-to-ceiling windows, if you want to have a balcony or floor-to-ceiling windows, you need to book a deluxe sea view queen room. Either way, I must have been fooled or induced.

Please take a look at the glass window in Figure 1, it is full of mud and sand.
Please take a look at the height of the glass window in Figure 2. It is at least 1.2 meters high. Generally, small children can't see the outside. Excuse me, I have spent more than 1,000 yuan, and I still care about the superior sea view queen room and the deluxe sea view. Is the price difference for a double room?
Please see Figure 3, there is only one partition between the big bed and the toilet.

In addition, when I arrived at the hotel in the afternoon, in order to have a quick meal, I ordered the meal directly at the hotel, but it took more than an hour for it to be delivered to the room, which was not as fast as Meituan’s takeout. What's worse, we ate that seafood noodle, which made my wife and I diarrhoea. The seafood must be stale. Ask the hotel if there is any anti-diarrheal medicine, said no. As a result, I had to go out to buy medicine by myself. The gastroenteritis caused by seafood noodles made us unable to lift our spirits and aches all over the next two days of the journey. Fortunately, the two children did not eat seafood noodles, otherwise it would be troublesome.

The outdoor barbecue at night is also very watery. One hundred sixty seventy barbecues are estimated to be only sixty or seventy outside. There is nothing to eat, and there is still a queue. The key is the draft beer, which he said at the beginning was gone, and also said that he would not serve it again later. There is also a limited amount of dishes. There should be two kinds of dishes, but it turns out that there is only one kind of so-called steak that can be eaten unlimited in other buffets.

All in all, it was an unpleasant journey. Shouldn't book a hotel like this next time.

After arriving at the store, I found that the hotel is very new, and the sea view room is very quiet with the windows closed. It can be said that there is no problem with the hardware and software of the hotel, the most important thing can be seen that the service awareness is very strong. It should be because of the impact of the epidemic, the hotel has not received so many guests for a long time, and it is a bit in a hurry, especially for breakfast. There are no vacancies, but the service staff go out of their way to accommodate every guest's request. Besides the environment, the hotel is close to the sea, you can catch the sea when you go out, you don't need to go to any scenic spots, and the children have a great time.

When I wished the Marriott, I once doubted whether it was because of the north, so the service was not meticulous enough. After coming to Hilton, I found out that the real five-star hotel can meet a unified national standard. First of all, when I checked out of the Marriott Hotel, I negotiated with them, and replied at the reception desk 10 minutes later. I hope I can understand that there are many people now. I said that it is only 10 minutes and 10 minutes, which should not delay the normal operation of the hotel. In addition, the breakfast table in this hotel is quite messy and no one cleans it up. The afternoon tea at the executive level is some pears and oranges, and they are still uncut and some quick biscuits. The vegetables for dinner and breakfast are a little dark, but they are not refined enough. Anyway, there are still many details, and I don't think they can meet the five-star standard. But then again, the scenery and hardware facilities are still ok.

Yantai Marriott is in the development zone. It costs 140 yuan to take a taxi to Penglai, and 60 yuan to take a high-speed taxi from Yantai South Station. It is not very convenient, but the location of the hotel is excellent. It takes one minute to enter the beach from the back door and 10 minutes to walk to the trestle.

msg:It is the right choice to choose Marriott for this trip to Yantai!

Service: ZoeyChen and Demi at the front desk were great, they helped us solve our need for a high-rise room with a balcony and were upgraded to an executive sea view room! When I learned that it was my birthday, I also sent a very delicious cake! ps: This is the first time I take the initiative to ask the name of the service staff to write a good review.

Steven Li from the breakfast depar**ent was also very helpful and helped us solve the problem of drinks in the lobby bar in the morning. The girls in the Chinese restaurant were also very enthusiastic and helped me store the cakes that my husband ordered.

🚗 Transportation: The development area has spacious roads, which is very suitable for friends who come to Yantai by car; the above-ground parking lot is usually enough, but it will be a bit crowded when catching up with the wedding.

🧹Sanitation: The room is very clean, the hot water is sufficient, the air conditioner is cool, the spare parts are replenished in time, the house is tidy and the clothes are folded, thank you very much. In terms of hardware facilities, I hope to add mirror headlights. At present, the lights are too dim to make up at all. The little light on the small vanity mirror doesn't work at all.

🍃Environment: The sea view is invincible. It is highly recommended to have a balcony room on a high floor. It's so cool!

🔔Other suggestions: In other respects, the executive lounge and Chinese restaurant are also used. Due to the peak season, people are quite noisy.

Especially when it comes to Chinese restaurants - generally speaking, Chinese restaurants in five-star hotels should be quite different from cafeterias in terms of price, environment and service. However, at present, there is no reservation system for Marriott's cafeterias? So customers are often overcrowded. Therefore, guests will be arranged to sit in the Chinese restaurant, which is very noisy and chaotic, and there is no quiet and high-end feeling at all. The waiters are also very hard working. They have to constantly wait on and clean a large number of buffet guests, so they cannot guarantee the first-class service for normal ordering customers.

My suggestion is that as a five-star hotel chain, we must strictly distinguish between the two restaurants. Chinese restaurants can appropriately increase prices and charge service fees, but they must ensure the proper environment, service and quality of dishes.

I would like to thank the service staff of the Chinese restaurant. Although it was very hard, they still tried their best to help us save the cake and serve it. Hope the hotel management will improve the situation of the Chinese restaurant.

Others are very good, next time I will choose Marriott! Great experience!

msg:I have always admired Marriott, but this time I was slightly disappointed.
It was only after careful selection that Marriott was chosen among the three international five-star hotels in Jinshatan Development Zone, one because it is the latest, and the other because it has a balcony, which is convenient for roommates to smoke. But my roommate thought it was a listed Marriott, and I'm afraid the quality would be compromised, but I think there should be no problem with the management being Marriott.
In fact, he and I were both right.
Check in is late at night. The first question arises. I booked a double bed, because I wanted to be more spacious with children, so I called twice before check-in to ask if the double bed could be combined, and if not, I changed the double bed. The concierge lady inquired and told that they do not provide merging service, but the bedside table can be moved and I can merge it myself. After moving in, I needed a rest, and I operated the bed at the first time. As a result, there were a lot of wires behind the bedside table! The kind that can't be pulled out! Dumbfounded, I immediately asked for a big bed room and replied that the room was full.
Here's a compliment to the manager on duty that night. She took care of it immediately, and went to the room in person later, pulled the bed out of the bedside cushions with her colleagues, avoided the bedside table and merged them together, so that we could sleep that night, promising to change it for us the next day Room. Including her, the service of the entire hotel is no problem, and they are very enthusiastic and proactive, which confirms what I said about the management of Marriott.
But there are still pitfalls.
1. After moving the bed, the bedside switch must be squeezed into the gap to operate. Maybe no one has ever been there before. The fleas or some poisonous insects bit me, and they continued to bite for the next few days. I still get goosebumps when I think about it.
2. The owner should save the cost as much as possible when decorating. The stopper of the wash basin is crooked; the shower room is leaking, and the whole bathroom is full of water when I take a shower, and I almost slipped several times; the bathroom has no separate compar**ent. These problems were present in at least two rooms I stayed in.
3. After changing rooms, the balcony is gone. I am a little disappointed, but I don't want to worry anymore.
4. There is a beach in front of the hotel, but it is a little small and the sand is thicker. It takes seven or eight minutes to drive to the core area of Golden Beach.
The roommate said that the overall feeling is not Marriott. The nearby Sheraton and Hilton did not stay, but the Hilton is the best location from the geographical point of view. The trestle is in front of it, and the sand is relatively finer.

msg:Guest room: I am very satisfied with the hotel room, especially the eldest sister who cleans, although I have not met, but the next day we may need to make milk powder for the child when we bring the child, so I put two extra bottles of water. After going out to play, the eldest sister kept the hygiene very clean.
Food: Poor to the extreme. The 188 yuan/person outdoor buffet in the beer garden, the seafood is very stale, and I have never eaten such stale seafood in Tibet. A five-star hotel in a seaside city in Yantai serves such stale seafood. And the barbecue is all spicy, children can't eat it, and adults eat it too. It is said that if it is so spicy on purpose, everyone will eat less. The mixed cucumbers in the cold dish area turned out to be the kind of whitish old cucumbers, and they were all healthy. It is estimated that no one eats that kind of cucumber thrown on the street. The same goes for the fried cucumbers for breakfast. The restaurant also provides a breakfast buffet on the second floor. The dishes are also very few and of poor quality. The floor tiles of the restaurant are loose and damaged and have not been replaced and repaired. The stainless steel buckets for hot water and hot milk in the restaurant are WMF stainless steel buckets, which are super dirty. And there was no lid. The first morning the milk bucket was covered with a white porcelain bowl. Put a dirty lid on the next morning. I don't know if the catering is outsourced or not, but it's a complete mess.
Overall: Five-star guest room, the reception of the lady in the front hall is also good, the concierge has a bad review, no one. I brought a lot of luggage with my child and no one helped me. I asked someone to help me and said that there was no concierge, so I went to dinner. Catering, if you can give negative points, it must be negative. Poor service, poor food, poor environment, poor hygiene.

I asked her what the executive courtesy was, and she told me a plate of fruit! Only later did I find out that the welcome fruit is given away when I stay at the hotel! She told me that executive courtesy is fruit! I rely on! Absolutely! Stayed in an executive room and did not experience executive courtesy at all! Two room cards, one of which has not been done yet, the elevator needs to swipe the room card, I just happened to take the one that was not done! The elevator in the underground parking lot is different from the elevator to the room! The plug of the hair dryer is loose, and you have to press the plug to blow your hair! But downstairs is the seaside, the sea view is quite invincible! The photo is very nice! It can be regarded as a comfort to the stay experience! The breakfast is average in a hotel with the same price.

And upgraded us to an executive room. During the three days and two nights of the stay, I received her enthusiastic help. I would like to express my thanks to her 🌹 The hotel has a very good environment, facing the boundless sea, and there is a private beach under the hotel, which is very beautiful and a good place for vacation. The only downside is that the hotel breakfast is a bit simple. Shandong is a province that eats pasta, but the only variety for breakfast is noodles. The steamed buns, flatbreads, dumplings, etc. that represent Shandong's characteristics did not appear in the breakfast. It is a little regrettable. I hope the restaurant can improve.

Free upgrade to the sea view room, the sea view effect is very good. The water volume of the rain shower head is also very large, and the bathtub also has a disposable bath bag, which is clean and hygienic. Going to the bath center for a day is better than staying at the hotel for a day~😄 My girlfriend is also very satisfied with the hotel! The service of demi and Lisa at the front desk is warm and will come again next time! 🤗

Living on the 17th floor, the balcony has a 180-degree view of the sea, and the sea view is invincible. The staff I met were very friendly, Zoey at the front desk, and a Ms. Chen had a very good attitude. The room service was very timely, and everything was delivered quickly. The disadvantage is that it coincides with the peak period. There are too many people for breakfast, and the supplements are not timely enough. The freshly made egg rolls are ordered when they go, and they are not lined up until the breakfast is finished.

If you go late, you have to queue up, and the food replenishment is not timely. I didn't want to eat outside the hotel because of the rain, so I went to the Chinese restaurant on the second floor for dinner. When I went down, I was told that it was full and I couldn't dine. Fortunately, the room is on the executive floor, so I went to the executive lounge to deal with it briefly, otherwise I can only order takeaway.

Recommend executive floor sea view room, invincible sea view!
Thanks to the hotel manager AINE, the front desk Dandan, who helped us open the room in advance (the child fell asleep, call in advance to help us make the room card), and we checked in quickly after arriving at the store!
We also thank Miss Kang Sunmi (Korean) and Miss Jennifer on the administrative floor of the 19th floor for taking care of our family of three, taking the children to see the scenery and looking for snacks...

📍Location: No. 365, Huanghe Road, Yantai Economic Development Zone
This is the first time I came to Yantai for skiing. I drove forty minutes from the city to check in Yantai Marriott. I lived up to my expectations. This Marriott is really super kind! Super generous! Platinum card check-in, upgrade to the suite, after check-in, I found that it is really the service ceiling of Shandong Marriott Depar**ent, which is simply amazing‼ ️
🛏Environment: Stay in an executive suite with sea view. The guest room is generally elegant and elegant. The bathroom marble has a super texture, double basin design, and the room is super well maintained. The living room and bedroom face the sea, overlooking the snowy sea and sky of Yantai. The lounge is located on the same floor as the room you are staying in, which is super convenient.
🌟Service: Great praise‼ ️In addition to being amazing, it is no longer possible to use words to describe the service of this Marriott. The humanistic care for the guests is fully explained. From the beginning of CI, Aine Zhang had prepared the guest room before moving in, and then sent it to the elevator. The warm service made us feel very considerate. The greeting from my little brother who continued to stay at the front desk the next day also felt the enthusiasm of Shandong people again! When going out for skiing, the guest room aunt will replace all the linen in the room, and the main thing is that the aunt is very gentle! It is thoughtful to place extra spare parts, the weather is dry, and the whole water is placed on the coffee table, which is also very intimate!
🍲Meals: Experienced happy hour in the hotel’s lounge and breakfast on the second floor. The breakfast dishes are rich in variety and some local specialties. They are of high quality, but the happy hour dishes in the lounge are a little bit out of the standard of luxury brands, but the lounge service is still top-notch.

Going to the seaside at night is really comfortable and the night scenery is also beautiful! Due to the change of itinerary, I continued to stay for another night.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good, suitable for holiday with children. Although the weather is not hot, although it catches up with the fireworks, it has no major impact. Because of the epidemic, he returned to Beijing early, and the child explained that he would come here to live and see the sea in the next year. I gave a small gift when I checked out and the child played all the way. Stayed for 5 days, breakfast did not change every day, and the older kids ate it to the end... I hope that the variety can be changed every day to have freshly squeezed juices. In the evening, the semi-self-service Chinese food needs to book a table in advance. The first day I have no experience in eating a serving is like playing a house. The next day I went to have experience and a dish would cost 2 to 3 minutes. I heard complaints about the quantity of dishes at the neighboring table for two days. If there was a reminder or a quantity display, it would be great. The taste is good. This trip to Yantai was very pleasant.

Stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and went back and forth between the beach and the hotel every day. The children had a great time! There were some episodes during the period. Frank helped us solve it perfectly. He was impressed by the excellent management of the internationally established hotels and the high quality of the staff! Thank you very much for letting us spend a perfect vacation at Marriott!
By the way, the Chinese restaurant on the second floor has the opportunity to give it a try. The large quantity is delicious and the price-performance ratio is quite high!

Walk along the coastline and you can see the most beautiful Tianma Trestle. During the stay, the mother’s birthday, the hotel sent a birthday greeting. It is a full cream cake, suitable for the elderly and children. More intimately, the seafood is processed for us. The attentive staff even delivered the condiments. The mother is very satisfied. Besides children, you are going out to the Internet celebrity water park. There are 20 kinds of amu*****t facilities, everything is available. The children are not addicted from morning to night. Under the night, they will carry a small bucket and shovel to the beach. If you have enough fun, you will have a hotel ready to come out. Clean the pool, wash the sand, and go back to the hotel to sleep. What's more important to mention is that during the tourist season, there will inevitably be a lot of people, and there will be a little episode. I just helped alleviate the embarrassment. As the leader of the hotel, in order to thank me for my effort, I specially gave us the breakfast buffet. Work attitude and sense of service are worthy of my recommendation. This hotel is suitable for parents and children, couples, and business trips. Through this time, I decided to let the elderly and children stay on the 19th floor for a month next year, perfect enjoyment.

msg:Every parent-child outing, choose five-star hotels as much as possible. When you come to Yantai during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, you should first consider the surrounding environment. It is the Golden Beach. There are three 5-star hotels in Golden Beach, Hilton, Marriott, and Sheraton. Decisively choose Marriott. I used my spouse’s Marriott member to book a luxury double, plus a service fee of about 795. I accidentally found that Ctrip had booked 719. I booked it for 4 days and 3 nights with Ctrip. I arrived at the hotel at around 6:30 pm on the first day of the long vacation. The child was in the car. I fell asleep, and I couldn’t drive the door with my baby in my arms. My wife wanted to take a bag and a suitcase. The doorman standing next to us was standing there watching us. He didn’t mean to step forward and help. Instead, the special car driver came down to help. We, this point is really deducted. If it is left in the past, the child is awake, I will pull the child with the bag, and the husband pulls the luggage. It is completely ok!
When I checked in, I informed that there were children and breakfast was only two mornings. Whether it was possible to send breakfast for a child, the little brother at the front desk was very embarrassed to consider it for a while and agreed. When I arrived in the room, there was dust on the table in the room, hair on the bedding, and stains on the toilet cover. Wipe it off with the alcohol cotton pad I brought. For breakfast, due to the small holiday, it was a little more than 8 o'clock in the morning for two consecutive days, and we had to wait in line. The dishes are slightly less, and the fried stuff is the majority. The oil is too big and very greasy. The only vegetables in the stir-fry are broccoli, garlic moss, and baby vegetables. There are only lettuce, carrots, and onions in the vegetable salad. In a five-star hotel in a coastal city, there is no seafood for breakfast, not even a small shrimp. Well, I can only comfort myself, there are so many small long dummy, the restaurant is too busy.
The hotel tends to be business-oriented, and the parent-child travel experience is average, especially with younger children. It is inconvenient to go to the toilet and wash. In the past, five-star hotels in other cities will have children’s toilets, and there will be a non-slip stool under the washbasin, which is convenient for children to stand there to wash. These days, adults have to hold or hold their armpits when children go to the toilet. The toilet is small, and the toilet is large. If you don’t support it, you will fall into it. You have to hold your hands to wash your hands. One person helps the child wash. When showering, there are no bathroom slippers in the bathroom. Adults stand barefoot and slip inside. , I hope that the hotel can consider some children's factors in it. After all, there are not a few families with children on long vacations, winter and summer vacations.
In addition, the advantage of the hotel is that the decoration is relatively modern. Each room has a large balcony with good lighting and ventilation. The climate in Yantai is very good. Although it is close to the sea, it is not humid. The back door of the hotel is a beach with few people and quiet!
Next time I come to Yantai, I will choose Marriott. I hope that the details of the hotel will get better and better.

I feel that it is the level of Samsung. The breakfast room is very small and it feels crowded. In addition, the service is average, and no one cares about it after moving in. In addition, the beach at the entrance is not good, small and thick. The sand at the entrance of Baina Ruiding Garden Hotel is very fine, it is very recommended. It's just not booked, the room is full. But the all-you-can-eat lunch is not bad. The bed is quite comfortable, the bathroom is a sliding door design, and the door cannot be completely locked.

前台工作人員辦理入住手續非常迅速也很專業，禮賓部的小哥哥會幫忙拿行李送到房間，非常貼心，酒店環境超讚，在房間裏就可以眺望大海，房間寬敞明亮，設施也很新，視野寬闊，環境優美。
早餐比想象的有秩序，即使用餐客人再多也會給你帶領落座，根據你的喜好需求端來熱乎乎的咖啡，早餐品種選擇也很多，可以滿足中西兩個胃蕾需求，而且還有先做的山東煎餅果子，Sabrina服務非常專業，貼心，而且也非常熱情，幫我們本地特色美食和介紹周邊可以玩的地方，彰顯出一個國際酒店該有的品質。住在酒店裡可以選擇的美食也很多，二樓西餐的晚上自助餐衹要148元一位，價格也是十分美麗，而且有三種做法的小龍蝦無限供應，喜歡吃海鮮的還有大蝦🍤生蠔🦪螃蟹🦀蛤蜊很多品種，工作人員還會推着肉車當面現切供應，喜歡吃三文魚的也可以無限量去領取[色]
來煙台一定要選擇萬豪酒店很值得推薦的，星級的標準，平民的消費！

msg:酒店服務很好，中規中矩，少了點驚喜的服務，讓人感覺很舒服 ，當天辦入住，可能是由於我在接打電話，感覺入住的流程衹是按照流程辦理，少了一些和顧客的溝通交流，也沒有詢問車牌號做登記，酒店的酒店的健身 游泳都沒有介紹，儘管我不一定去，第二天續住時，前台小於服務很好，微笑服務，態度都很好，算是感覺到了星級酒店服務該有的樣子，酒店服務不錯，但缺乏服務的主動性 ，個性化服務，比較內斂吧，不太喜歡和客人溝通。入住當晚去了二樓自助晚餐，酒店菜品不多很精緻，但是好多菜和海鮮區 菜量太少  ，毛肚  三文魚  海鮮基本都是空的，也沒有及時補充，有一些都沒有了，每人一份的主菜，牛排或者大蝦確實不太好，一個大蝦，很小的一份牛排，餐飲的體驗真心有點差。

再説早餐，人也是真多，做煎餅那在排隊，應該能好吃的樣子，排了一個味道還闊以，廚房小哥哥推薦了蓬萊小麪，味道不錯，不用去外面單獨品嚐蓬萊小麪了，衹顧得吃，照片是真沒拍幾張，還是跟朋友聊天記錄裏找了幾張，在2樓用餐時遇到了廚師長的推薦與幫助，還是很舒心的，廚房上班的人看着也不是很多啊，不同的檔口看到了同一個人在忙活，現在的工作，有誰又是那麼容易的呢，總之住了一天去，還是很愉快的，希望夏天再來的時候會更好，有個更愉快的旅行

msg:🌊【位置與景觀】🌊 首先，不得不提的是酒店的位置，面朝大海，那種一覺醒來就能看到大海的壯麗景色，真的讓人心曠神怡。酒店開業時間不長，所以設施都非常新，給人一種耳目一新的感覺。

🛍【酒店升級】🛍 春節期間入住，酒店非常大方地為我們升級到了21層的行政樓層，還贈送了行政酒廊的使用權。這個升級真的讓我們的住宿體驗提升了一個檔次，行政酒廊的環境也非常舒適，適合放鬆和休息。

🏞【房間景觀 房間的海景真的是無敵了！早上起來，拉開窗簾，就能看到一片蔚藍的大海，那種感覺真的很浪漫。房間的佈局簡約而温馨，現代化的設施一應俱全，開放式洗手間設計讓整個房間顯得更加開闊。雖然開放式洗手間讓我感覺有點沒有安全感，但整體來説，房間的設計我還是非常喜歡的。房間裏提供的速溶咖啡對我來説有點小遺憾，如果能有膠囊咖啡機的話，那就更加完美了。不過沒關係，如果想喝咖啡，可以去行政酒廊接一杯，雖然行政酒廊的咖啡豆也很一般，但總體來説，還是能滿足我的咖啡需求。

🌟【服務體驗】🌟 作為老牌的五星酒店，萬豪的服務設施非常標準化，即使在春節期間，人流量很大，服務也沒有擺爛，反而都還挺好的。特別值得一提的是，我們的小相機遺失了，酒店的工作人員非常積極地幫助我們尋找，最終順利找回了相機。這種貼心的服務讓我們感到非常安心。

總結一下，煙台鑫廣萬豪酒店無論是從位置、景觀、房間設施還是服務來説，都是一個值得推薦的住宿選擇。如果你想在春節期間找一個安靜舒適的地方度假，這裏絕對是一個不錯的選擇。

給水從不吝嗇這點真的非常好。但是。。。。咖啡是速溶這是幾個意思啊😂隔壁喜來登的房間裏都有法壓壺和咖啡粉好嗎🤦♀️
Lounge的早餐種類不多，但勝在人少。不過假期裏窗邊的桌子一直是滿的，服務員也有點忙不過來，在節假日就稍稍降低一下期望值吧。

msg:第二次入住鑫廣萬豪，理由跟簡單，大品牌、交通方便、有地庫、面海、價格適中。
到達前，前台就打電話詢問到達時間、入住偏好等；辦理入住時，前台的Oumpkin非常禮貌而又熱情的介紹了各種事項，包括早餐時間、行政酒廊的時間、是否開車、是否需要延遲退房等。同時添加了微信，入住的幾天，都在關注入住感受，對提出的要求，比如增加一床被子、增加幾支身體乳等，都做出了及時處理。退房後，又做了回訪。誠意滿滿👍實事求是的講，萬豪的硬件設施已經有一些老舊的跡象，必經已經開業六年。隔壁的希爾頓酒店差不多時間，感覺更舊，而且房間的味道有些令人不舒服（這一點因人而異）。但是，人性化的管理和服務可以彌補硬件上的不足。必經還是五星級的標準。早餐還算豐富，在應對春節這種客流高峯的情況下，餐食補充的很快，衹有現做的檔口，比如麪檔、煎餅果子，會排隊等候。當然避開高峯是最好的選擇。行政酒廊同樣需要避開高峯。帶陽台的行政房非常推薦，打開陽台門就是新鮮的空氣和不遠處的海！去年春節趕上下大雪，陽台上都是雪，遠處是海，非常美！

這個酒店給人感覺就是他們做政府相關的團隊生意已經夠用了，所以根本不在乎散客的滿意度，前台的態度都是那種表面客氣，實際敷衍的風格。
因為這家店，對煙台的第一印象都很差。
同一海岸線有其他酒店，不要來踩坑。

設施：酒店設施就是五星中規中矩，但是我非常想吐槽的是房間的水，亞朵全季都用的是農夫山泉了，萬豪竟然是純水樂；早餐中規中矩，一般
衞生：衞生不錯的，收拾房間很及時
服務：服務人員都不錯，收房的大叔每次都打招呼，大早上很晚讓人開心，餐廳的服務員阿姨也很熱情！就是煮麪條的阿姨比較敷衍；總體還是算得上五星服務啦。
總結：總體很滿意，帶孩子來，就不要去其他景點了，酒店連住，出去趕海就很不錯；養馬島不太適合寶寶；適合網紅打卡拍照。其餘的也是；孩子提不起任何興趣。總之，帶孩子選這個酒店沒問題的❤️

msg:來之前對比了金沙灘的3家五星酒店，萬豪勝出的原因是距離海灘較近，設施相對較新，房間帶陽台，泳池健身房齊全，到店以後感覺符合預期，裝修風格很有藝術感，服務人員熱情，門口有電動和人力四輪車，向西可以騎到天馬棧橋，向東可以騎到距離孤獨的鯨1公里左右，可能是因為修路，目前被攔着，將來如果開通了就完美了。房間各項設施齊全，陽台180°海景無敵，建議行政酒廊全天提供酒精類飲料😁另外金沙灘真心贊，沙子特別細而且乾淨，且沙灘特別平緩，可以往海里走好遠，海水也很清，感覺完爆三亞的各個灣，帶娃度假的話可以無腦沖，絕不會失望😎

👶前台男生很好，贈送了早餐🍳，第二天因為想去鯨落之地，順利辦理了延遲退房。
🥤入住是中秋節，酒店格外贈送了兩塊月餅，房間贈送的一支筆萊陽梨汁真真是我的童年，味道沒有改變，大大點贊😘

次日Carrie小姐又幫我裝飾了小帳篷和美人魚玩偶搖搖馬，孩子興奮之情溢於言表。我選擇續住我有一部分原因就是源於美麗的Carrie小姐。
最後一日我們從博物館回來晚了，這位可愛的小姐立刻幫我延遲退房到14:00。
酒店樓下就是海灘，很乾凈很安靜，花園有洗腳池，硬件沒有什麼問題，跟大多數五星酒店差不多水準，但Carrie小姐絕對是這家酒店的寶貝員工，請好好愛護她。

msg:設施：比較全
衞生：尚可
環境：還可以
服務：非常差
單人自助早餐:人擠人，東西難吃
特別禮遇:無

住店期間幾件事情讓我印象非常深刻，簡單分享一下：1/有半坡停車場，但是不讓停，非要停很遠的指定停車場，讓人非常難以理解；2/第一天到達後發現無法看到海，遂與服務枱通電話，告知需要換房，服務枱明確告知可以，已經幫忙登記，第二天有人退房就立馬安排，上午再打電話過去，説是還要等一等，中午打過去説是正在辦，下午打過去説是換不了，因為沒跟他們説，離大譜！3/自助早餐一間房衹有一個成人可以進，第二個人要付80，付錢進去後當時就後悔，吃的東西非常少，味道奇差無比，位置很難等，找了二十分鐘好不容易在角落裡擠了個位置，服務員收拾也不積極，催了三次，早知道我點外賣不好嗎，80塊錢吃早飯能吃出花來，省的在這裏受氣；4/入住期間，酒店好像有個什麼會議，不讓出門，説要等會議結束之後才可以出門，***當時就怒了，我來花錢住店是受你這個氣的？不讓我出酒店門什麼意思？後來在我強勢交涉下，讓我從偏門出去了，結果回來的時候不讓我進，説是正在開會，又吵一架，讓我走了會議的安檢才勉強放行。我就想不通了，你們這樣做有沒有動過腦子，有沒有考慮過旅客的想法，實在是重大會議活動，我們講道理，不是不能理解，你提前説一聲，我們好安排行程和時間，這沒毛病吧，你們做了嗎？5/還是説回停車的問題，我們自駕前往，結果車子停在酒店的停車場，打電話過來叫開走，説是領導要停，***人都傻了，啥意思，旅客不是人，衹有領導是人？人生地不熟不想惹麻煩，那就下去挪車吧（我停在邊角落裡完全不礙事），結果周圍**全是車位，不下於20個，我尋思着你們領導是看中我停的這塊風水寶地了？還是看我車不順眼就針對我？6/酒店地毯有異味；7/酒店移門嘎吱聲太大；8/酒店隔音很差勁；9/酒店開關設計不合理，衹能全開全關，不能精確到某一盞燈開和關，想不通，可能咱沒住過高檔酒店？（手動滑稽）10/保安很吊，非常吊，鼻子朝天，之前説不讓我進出，以及挪車的，都是這批保安，且無法溝通，且脾氣非常大（劃重點），筒子們儘量不要和保安起沖突，防止人懟你（手動狗頭）。總結一下：位置沒的説，環境還可以，服務太差，人員素質有待提高，離店後酒店打電話回訪，以上十點全部跟回訪員反映過，説是很抱歉第二天上午領導回覆我電話，結果快一個月了沒有任何人聯繫我，**真的呵呵，下次再也不來了，吃虧上當就一回，親們自己把握吧！（手打不易，可累死我了，請認真看完，栓Q鐵子們）

這個房型跟豪華陽台大的裝修一樣，僅多了陽台及軟服務（香皂、搓澡巾、歡迎禮），淡季出遊能在這個價格享受萬豪的海景房，性價比倒是很高。
早餐馬馬虎虎，人很多，品種太少了，建議增加中餐品種，幾乎都是冷餐，導致僅有的現煮麪餐排起大長龍，在排餐過程中廚子還把一個小姐姐的餐給了別人，導致人家白等了7.8分鐘最後一氣之下不吃走了，也沒有道歉，跟沒事人一樣，再有就是麪條鹵真的好難吃。

酒店鬧中取靜，距離沙灘、永旺都很近，吃喝方便；房間很大，完全寬敞夠用，樓層高視野非常好，小朋友看了好久夜景；提前預約了嬰兒床，晚間睡覺比較解放，不用擔心小朋友翻滾受傷；早餐非常豐富，大人和孩子的口味都能滿足，可能是知道我們帶了小寶寶，房間裏的礦泉水也很足，不用再要了很貼心方便；行政酒廊的點心不錯，也有我愛的乾薑水，飯就一般啦，但是其實和百納瑞汀同等的價格，酒廊的簡餐就相當於是送的，我們不方便出門的家長用來填飽肚子也是很夠啦。
全程帶娃實在沒怎麼拍照，文字描述下吧，和住過的其他萬豪差不多，完全在線，還多了無敵海景，放心沖啦

衞生：可能是離沙灘比較近，房間被褥上有細沙。
特別禮遇:白金卡給升了房，但是沒有行政禮遇。還有就是在萬豪旅享家上面訂不到房，我是在攜程上訂的，好在辦入住的帥哥給幫了很大的忙，把積分都累積了，遺憾是第一天沒辦法算。也能按第三方價格算。不太理解是旅享家上面的都比第三方貴。

環境：整體環境還好，臨近海邊，景觀不錯。
服務：感覺酒店工作人員有點慢待，對待攜程散客不夠友好，訂的是海景房，安排的房間是最偏僻的且最矮的，還是被平台遮擋！再強烈要求下更換了其他高樓層房間。

退房退按金，也是無法按前台説的時間退，衹能反饋到攜程，退的倒是快了……呵呵；
我説的是否屬實都有聊天記錄的哈
總的來説，對萬豪這家酒店我衹想給差評！對攜程我想給好評！

酒店環境很好，出酒店到海邊也很近，非常適合放鬆度假，帶兩個小朋友，我們不喜歡太累的走景點，小朋友的快樂也是海水沙灘，所以入住這種度假試酒店大人放鬆，孩子玩的開心
早餐自助餐窗邊就能看到海邊，食物品種豐富，補充及時，當地水果蘋果和桃子都很甜，咖啡還有外帶紙杯，貼心又周到
晚餐自助餐價位合理，在室外草坪用餐，用餐心情愉快
每個房間都有很大的露台，適合觀海
房間服務也很及時，有需要馬上就能夠解決，有摺疊晾衣架，有寶寶需要清洗的衣服多，很方便
房間隔音很好，我們住在電梯出來第一間，沒有客人路過的吵鬧聲
非常愉快的一次入住體驗，下次還會選着這個酒店度假

服務：服務真不錯，特別表揚行政酒廊的工作人員拾金不昧的精神，丟在酒廊一個包能主動交到前台，不知道是哪一位工作人員，在此給你點贊。

前台的Tina在我們入住前主動電聯詢問行程安排，升級了房型，為酒店的熱情好客打了前站！
行政酒廊基本解決了晚飯問題，兩位帥哥孫先生，高先生又是幫孩子盛南瓜粥、倒牛奶，又是幫家裡長輩推薦酒水，工作積極認真，懂禮貌有涵養！
我們住在1703的海景套房，景觀特別好！17層的客房服務劉阿姨，也是事無鉅細，知道我們住的久，主動拿了一大提礦泉水，幫忙安置晾衣架和行李，出門還提醒我們帶好雨具，真是給人賓至如歸的感覺，很暖心！
真切感受到每個工作人員都在努力工作，把服務工作做到盡善盡美，萬豪品牌沒有讓人失望！期待下次相聚…

msg:酒店地理位置不錯，小花園出去就是沙灘，踩踩水很不錯。房間的話因為正對大海，景觀很不錯。服務確實不錯，所有的工作人員態度都很好，也非常熱心。

兩個吐槽點吧
第一個就是check in的時候跟前台再三説了要安靜一點的房間，選了半天，結果進去一看，好嘛，房間就在操作平台上，陽台門根本不能開，一打開就是轟隆隆的聲音。由於當天淋雨了，急着洗澡換衣服，就沒有換房間，真的很不爽。
第二個就是早飯吧，品種真的很少，拿着盤子走一圈沒有一個是想吃的，兩天都是一碗餛飩解決

下次來煙台可能還會選擇這家，喜歡一眼望出去都是海的感覺，就是希望早飯可以改善一下

msg:可以説是住過的最差的萬豪了。去之前還在想為什麼這麼便宜，去了之後就一點也不意外了。
撇開房間不説，服務甚至還不如亞朵。入住兩天來回進出酒店沒有聽到過一次問候；入住時前廳比較冷漠；想要錄入車牌時，禮賓部沒有人在崗位上；房間裏的歡迎信皺皺巴巴，一看就是循環利用了很多次還沒有妥善保存。
尤其想要投訴的是早餐。
第一，領位員形同虛設。到達餐廳確實有領位員幫忙安排位置，但問題是領位員並不清楚哪裡是空位。她一開始帶我們去的桌子時空的，但被旁邊的服務員提醒已經有人了，第二張桌子被提醒被預訂了，第三張桌子明顯上面有一碗粥，我們直到被帶到第四張桌子才坐下。
第二，自助補餐非常不及時。我們是九點二十左右去的，轉第一圈的時候，基本上什麼都沒有了，衹能點了一碗麪，拿了一個茶葉蛋。後面再去倒是陸陸續續上了，但有些小料要靠客人提醒已經沒了才意識到要補。冷盤區我去了三次都是空盤，不知道是不是我運氣不好。
第三，食品安全問題。早餐的味道確實一般，但最令人生氣的還是食品安全。我們在炒燜餅中吃到了一根短頭髮。另外，我們其中一位在吃完早飯後出現了嚴重的嘔吐和不適，猜測是因為豆漿或者酸奶。

之前在國內僅在成都住過一次萬豪，結果失望透頂，當時還以為是國內外酒店服務的整體差異，結果這次煙台萬豪就徹底翻盤，讓我們知道國內五星級酒店也是可以很給力的。
1. 首先感謝每次都很到位的客房服務人員們：打掃得又快又乾淨，住宿期間每次麻煩他們幫忙送東西來都很體貼迅速，一位小姐姐看到我是孕婦還主動送來長毛地墊，以防摔倒；
2. 2F全日餐廳的工作人員也很給力：這裏貌似是酒店唯一一處全天開放的餐廳，早餐時從進門帶路鋪桌到菜品調劑都很熱情周到，下午去吃加餐時，經理姐姐還囑咐我們適當吃點，晚上還有夏日BBQ自助（就在海邊歐）！結果晚上我們被熱情的工作人員們填個了肚兒圓，回去去健身房各種加運動量消耗（笑）。P.S. 甜點部的小蛋糕超級好吃！
3. 前台小姐姐得知我家人發燒要去醫院，立刻又送了我們兩瓶水，並囑咐我們打車去醫院哪個門更近，太體貼了。
4. 泳池和健身房都很乾凈，且都可以看海景。

如果可以在陽台坐着喝咖啡聽海浪聲音就更完美了。
屋裡的温度被子都很舒服，睡的很好。
有個大浴缸，小朋友美慘了，不出門就想在酒店泡澡。
微微有點不方便就是廁所應該有個門。

msg:第一次如此認真寫評價，是希望帶孩子的朋友避坑。第一次來煙台，很喜歡這個城市，但這家萬豪令我大跌眼鏡。之前看了評論很多人説服務不行我是有心理準備的，依然選了這裡是因為雙床房的床是1.4米寬，想着我倆帶個七歲小童會住的舒適些。定好房之後致電酒店詢問是否有小童浴袍，得到肯定的答覆，工作人員查到我的訂單後説讓我辦理入住的時候和前台説一下會送到房間，我問能否現在備註，工作人員才説好的。其實這個時候我就隱約覺得不妙，因為經常旅行，之前酒店人員都會很熱情的直接説幫我備註好。
我們在煙台待了五天，在這裏住了四晚，入住當天在房間看到了小童浴袍和一套小童的洗漱洗浴，孩子很開心。可惜裏面的牙刷應該是針對很小的那種孩子的，娃用不慣。隊友洗手洗臉洗澡都習慣用香皂，房間沒有。入住後的第二天：早晨臨出去玩兒時我給前台打電話説打掃房間之後請別忘了再放一件小童浴袍，到了大堂不放心又跑到前台囑咐了一下，晚上九點半回房間依然沒有，衹好打電話問前台要。這次倒是主動放了香皂。十點多我才發現房間打掃完之後沒有放瓶裝水，孩子已經睡下，怕打擾孩子，隊友去我們車裡拿的自己帶的水（我們自駕）。入住後第三天：早上又打電話問前台要水。晚上隊友説怎麼一直沒給孩子放乾淨的小童拖鞋啊？孩子的小童拖鞋已經穿了三天了，又打電話要。晚上洗澡我也很疑惑為什麼沒有女士的刮毛刀，想想也許這家店本來就沒有，再湊活一天該走了，也就沒有問。第四天，下午（非週末而且是非午餐時間）點了一份漢堡，孩子對洋葱過敏，特意備註了“不要洋葱，免辣”，等了五十分鐘終於到了，我得到的是一份夾着洋葱漢堡和撒了辛辣調料的沙拉，而且還沒有叉子，我都被氣笑了，衹能又打電話要。至於為什麼不按照訂單備註準備餐食，我不想生氣影響心情，隊友出門給娃買了麥當勞回來。
第五天一早我們走的時候在樓道里碰到了打掃衞生的大姐熱情的問我們在這裏住的怎麼樣，出於禮貌我笑着説很好，這幾天辛苦您了。大姐熱情的給孩子了一個小童牙刷和一雙一次性的小童拖鞋。至此，我才知道原來是有這種小童牙刷的，我們住的這五天四晚，臨走給了一個小童牙刷。這幾天我在萬豪聽到了太多的“不好意思”。出入大堂也沒有任何一位工作人員主動向我們問好。我遇到的這些情況絕對不是五星級應該出現的。作為一對經常帶娃出門遊玩兒的父母，我很負責的説這個酒店管理是肯定有問題的。帶娃出門旅行其實很耗心力，選擇五星級酒店就是想舒心一些，這次真的太令人失望。照片我都附上了，訂單可以看到我的房間號和漢堡備註。最後那張小童牙刷是臨走時送給孩子的。
煙台我們很喜歡，還會再來，但這家萬豪我絕對不會再入住。

優點：1.酒店周邊環境空曠、安靜、衞生。東面是海景，西面是樹林公園。2.停車方便。
缺點：1.客房衞生打掃一般，地板不乾淨，有許多死角。2.衞生紙、紙抽品質極差，還不如舒適型（如全季）快捷酒店的用紙品質。3.浴巾、毛巾等洗滌品質極差（注意用詞是極差，硬撅撅的、黑糊糊的）。3.早餐真的很難吃，用料差、製作更差、口味還不如舒適型快捷酒店的早餐。4.自助晚餐更差，品種少，沒有一個品種是精緻的，更像大食堂，地面黏糊糊的粘鞋。管理者太不用心了，二樓自助餐廳的衞生極差，根本不像五星萬豪酒店應該有的品質。

其次，酒店的設施設備十分完善。房間內的佈置典雅大方，床鋪非常舒適，讓人一躺下就能進入夢鄉。房間內的空調、WiFi和智能電視等設備一應俱全，讓我們在入住期間享受到了便捷的生活體驗。
再者，萬豪酒店的服務人員非常熱情周到。他們總是面帶微笑，耐心地解答我們的問題，併為我們提供貼心的幫助。無論是在辦理入住手續還是在用餐過程中，我們都能感受到萬豪酒店對客人的尊重和關愛。
最後，萬豪酒店的餐廳給我們留下了深刻的印象。餐廳內的環境優雅，菜品豐富多樣，味道美味可口。我們嘗試了酒店的早餐，無論是中式還是西式，都讓人讚不絕口。此外，餐廳還提供了各種酒水和飲料，讓我們在用餐過程中盡享美食與美酒的完美融合。
總之，這次入住萬豪酒店的五星級體驗讓我感受到了酒店的優質服務和舒適環境。在此，我要對萬豪酒店表示由衷的感謝，並期待下次再度光臨！

msg:在煙台的最後一天選擇了萬豪，總體體驗下來，中等偏上吧。
環境：無敵海景，床上就能看到大海。就是這個地方稍微有點偏旁邊沒啥店，也沒有共享單車…衹能打車出去。
設施：房間內的設施很新，但是有三個小問題，一是隔音不是很好，二是智能窗簾不是很靈光，三是浴室和客房是開放式設計用可移動木門隔開這個設計見仁見智了。
服務和衞生：沒問題，標準五星級。
但是我要吐槽的是，酒店的早餐太差了，種類少檔次低，是我住過的萬豪裏最差的…甚至感覺不如前幾天住的亞朵，希望以後能夠提升一下！

房間升級了個套房，帶着陽台，小朋友很開心很喜歡。酒店衞生ok，前台告訴了電梯旁邊就是推門出去的海灘，小朋友還去趕海了挖到了蛤。
小朋友説下次還想來，還會選擇這裏的！

行政樓層的下午茶，太簡單了，衹有水果-桔子-曲奇餅。應該是我見過的，品種最少，最不走心的行政樓下午茶了。

平日去的，愜意，人不多，散散心度假的心情很不錯。晚上可以在沙灘散步，沙灘比較平，碰到很多人打着燈在海里撈啥。有機會會再去。

環境可以，雖然在開發區，但是酒店也在水上樂園內部，可惜這幾天天氣不好，不然閑暇逛逛應該不錯
服務可以，但是人員嚴重不足，餐廳上菜速度賊慢，車輛離場，訊息沒錄入，打電話四五個才有人接，説是忙不過來
設施可以，三樓有配備泳池和健身房，面朝大海，心情愉悦
提供的嬰兒床太深，不方便放孩子，也不方便抱孩子
餐廳嬰兒座椅太臟，建議定期擦拭
早餐種類不多，好在質量還行
離店的時候孩子的泳圈忘拿了，到下午也沒人提醒，還是我們自己發現打電話給酒店才知道的

msg:煙台旅遊住過好幾家酒店，萬豪是唯一敗筆。而且可以很負責任地説，入住萬豪的體驗為本人平生住店之最差，沒有之一！
第一，酒店大堂門口一條路兩頭都被攔住了，不讓車開到門口，入住和離店需要自己拖着行李從停車場走過去。入住當天煙台八九級大風，下着大雨，我拖着兩個大行李箱，風大得完全沒法撐傘，就這麼淋着雨頂着狂風，帶着長者小孩自己從坡下停車場走到酒店大堂，狼狽至極，酒店也完全沒有人幫忙。
第二，好不容易走進大堂，迎來的就是跟機場一樣的安檢，不但行李過安檢，身上還要正着反着來回照。不知這是住店還是進監獄？！
第三，本來住這個酒店的一部分原因是去沙灘方便，結果入住時酒店正對着沙灘的門還被封了，需要從停車場下方繞行去沙灘，沒有引路牌，沒有任何標誌，全靠自己兩條腿去探路。
這空前絕後的入住體驗希望對其他人有幫助！
撇開這糟糕的體驗，單純從遊玩角度來説，也完全沒必要住這個角落。沙灘綿延約十公里，住哪裡都可以做到出門就是沙灘。

1.週五1540左右到的酒店，三個窗口辦理入住，2兩窗口在處理用户投訴（等待了很久房間還沒收拾出來），我在另一個窗口等待了10分鐘左右前面的人辦理完我看是辦理入住，很快房間也是已經收拾了；
2.週日入住的人開始多了，有個低碳的大會很多人在這裏住，為了配合這個大會酒店裝了安檢，外賣不讓進，直通沙灘的出口不讓走了（要繞行三四百米）等等很多不便的事情發生了，這一切都沒有事前告知；
3週一退房走人，當時6級大風+大雨，大堂我看見的最少有3個家庭都是帶着孩子和行李的，酒店正門不讓網約車進來，衹能是那些大會的擺渡車才能進，網約車衹能到隔壁的會議中心的正門，會議中心和酒店內部是聯通的，但是就是不讓我們走，我們幾個家庭多次溝通都不行，最後還是讓我們從酒店外面帶着孩子頂着大風大雨去繞過去大概50-100米的距離（大堂有個經理打車雨傘幫我們抱着一個孩子走過去），一問行李車連防雨罩都沒有。

msg:是怕酒店不行，所以衹在攜程上訂了一晚。體驗感非常不好，首先一到酒店就看到臉上打霜的前台，（開始以為是個別人員，後來換班了碰到的也是一樣）到了房間讓送雙小童拖鞋催了兩次一個多小時才送來，因為酒店比較偏，我們選擇晚上在酒店吃自助餐，海邊城市居然海鮮都是mini版的，並且也不新鮮。第二天吃早餐人山人海，東西居然要靠搶，簡直歎為觀止。

msg:作為在煙台這樣一個城市2000+的酒店，各方面衹能説是普通。我們入住的房間沒放拖鞋、沒有衣架，還一股煙味。去年給我留下不錯印象的酒店的沙灘，今年是臟得一塌糊塗，海苔、各種塑料垃圾、大塊的陶粒、石頭，讓人完全沒有去玩的慾望。唯一可圈可點的是房間床品比較對我的胃口，休息得很好。在高處眺望大海，還算心曠神怡。總之，這裏沒有什麼性價比，如果沙灘能弄得好點，度假也還算舒服，如果沙灘繼續這麼臟下去，那就沒必要來了。
