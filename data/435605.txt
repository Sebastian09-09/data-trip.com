msg:Usually I’d have something good to say but this time when my fiancé and I went for a lovely getaway, SIG’s amenities were horrible and they fail to mention that on their booking information. There was construction within the hot springs and the the spa was closed. There was no special massage for us. We would usually get the Jade massage but that was not possible this trip. Furthermore, being the only foreigners that had the Vanilla Villa, no one knew what we wanted when it came to driver coming to retrieve us—we spoke mandarin on the phone; they still did not understand us. Lastly, the “western” dinner and breakfast buffet was missing the western food. Needless to say, SIG is not what it use to be. We’ll try again in 2023; this when the place should be done with construction and offer all its great amenities again.

After soaking in the hot spring, I went to the steam room to sweat. It was very comfortable. And I could go there again before checking out the next day after sleeping. There was no limit on the number of times before checking out, which was very humane.

The hot spring area is very stingy when asking for bath towels. The buffet breakfast is really bad, with too few varieties. My husband said it is worse than a three-star hotel. Fortunately, we did not have a buffet dinner there. The only good thing is that the water quality in the hot spring area is OK, and the children have a lot of fun. It is recommended to go to the hot spring alone and do not stay overnight. The accommodation experience is not good.

Also, the hot springs are all outdoors, and it takes a long way to walk back to the hotel. I caught a cold after taking a hot spring bath. Finally, the hotel service is also average. There is no need to go. If you want to take a hot spring bath, you might as well go directly to the hot spring bathing place. This place is really neither fish nor fowl.

This is really the first time I have encountered a hotel with such a low management level and such a mess. The above real experience is simply a nigh**are night. Everyone, open your eyes!

It was the first time I arranged a shuttle with the hotel to go to the hot spring spot, but it was actually very close. The weather was good and it didn’t rain. We walked on our own on the way back. Back to the guest room. Whether it is an outdoor hot spring or an indoor cave hot spring, it is very comfortable. Some of the dishes in the hotel's breakfast have changed over the two days, and there are many types to choose from, which is quite filling. The cleaning staff are very attentive, polite and provide good service. The hotel also arranges robots to deliver takeaway food to the door of the room, which is very interesting!

msg:1. The facilities in the villa are too old. It feels like a hotel in the 1990s. The TVs are all small-screen old models. The beds are still hard beds, and the quilts are very thin. The whole family caught a cold after sleeping for a night. The stairs are narrow and steep, which may be a safety hazard if there are elderly people or children. One of the four legs of the balcony table is crooked.
2. The 200 buffet is more than the price. There is nothing else in the hot pot except beef. The seafood is only shells and mussels that can't fill the bottom of the tank.
Even dinner for 2 people cost nearly 2,000, but the actual experience is not worth the price. It is recommended that the hotel should be upgraded.

You can enjoy a discounted price when you check in. Salmon is fine, seafood is fresh, and live shrimp are all available in hot pot. Almost jumped out of the pot, personally, it is not inferior to the buffet of a few star hotels.
On the day of check-in, I soaked in the hot spring. The next day, the children played in the children's playground on the second floor of the hotel, and refused to go home.
The overall experience is a good itinerary!

msg:Try not to go to other places during the epidemic, so this time I chose a local tour. Shengzhixiang Hot Spring Resort is also quite famous in Xiamen. This time, the Xiamen Municipal Government will subsidize the hotel by 100 yuan per day during the May 1st period, which can be received after check-out, and it is still given in cash, which is given on the spot. It may be the reason that there are more than five people. This time I stayed in the hot spring villa, and there was no butler service as mentioned in the comments. Don’t even think about delivering fruits and desserts. When checking in, pay more attention to epidemic prevention and control, health code, and itinerary. The code was checked very carefully. After the transaction was successful, the front desk gave a room card. After that, I didn't care about anything. If I had something to do, I pressed 0 to find them in my room. At that time, I asked for 2 room cards, but I didn’t give them. They said that if I wanted to get the electricity card, take the business card on the counter and insert the card. I reminded everyone not to be fooled. I took the business card on the counter and inserted the card as the front desk said. , it can't be used, and I also tried several other chip cards of my own, but they can't be used, only the hotel room card can be used. Let’s talk about the villa. The one I live in is relatively old, but there are several buildings in the villa area being renovated. The room only has one big bed, but an extra bed can be added. The extra bed is a small bed with a width of 90 cm. Perfect for a family of 2 adults and 2 children. An extra bed is 200 yuan per day, if a single extra bed quilt is 50 yuan. If you pay 200 yuan for an extra bed, you will also get a free breakfast. The breakfast bill is 88 yuan for adults and 48 yuan for children. In addition to a free breakfast, you will also get an adult hot spring park ticket on the day. If you buy a ticket for the hot spring park, it is 100 yuan for 2 people, so 200 yuan for an extra bed is quite cost-effective. but! but! but! No one will tell you about the discounts of these breakfasts and hot spring park tickets after the extra bed. I also took the initiative to call and ask if the extra bed had breakfast before I found out that there are still these rights. If you ask the waiter to come to the room and arrange the bed, no one will tell you that you still have these rights, and the hotel is too boring in this regard. Also, the air conditioner in the room is too loud and is more sensitive to noise, so be careful. Although the bubble pool in the room is a few years old, it is still quite OK, very large, and the flow of hot spring water is also large, which can quickly fill a large pool. The surrounding environment of the villa is also very good. The waiters can also solve the problems raised by the customers in a timely manner. There are many amu*****t facilities for children to play on the 2nd floor of the hotel lobby, which is very good. In short, although there are some unsatisfactory places, the hotel is still very good, and there are still many places in the hotel that are still being renovated and upgraded, and it will definitely be better in the future.

The three sets of utensils in the room are all adults. There are only two bathrobes and they are adults. Said to send fruit, no. There are no children's supplies in the room. As soon as the child enters, there are no slippers, and there is no bathrobe when going to the hot spring. Say a piece of 10 yuan? I said that there would have been 3 adults and 1 child, and you didn't even give me the money and told me to pay? All came after calling and asking. When I came back at night, I was afraid that the child would be cold, so I asked about adding 20 quilts. The breakfast is not bad, the ingredients are very fresh. There are some simple equipments for children to play in the lobby on the 1.2 floor of the hotel. Young children can be very happy.
Because it is a special management, you must stay in a hotel to take a hot spring. It is very convenient to take a hot spring only. It is next door and only two steps away. We went in at night and it was a bit cold, but the waiter was pretty good. Seeing that our children are young, I kept asking Do we want to change the towels?

1. It is far away from the island, and the taxi is about 130 yuan, and it is already in the suburbs of Tong'an. (After seeing the map, you can accept far.)
2. The vanilla villa that has not been renovated is really poorly maintained! Wall repairs, aging wires, and spider webs are just a rough villa! (Later, the lobby manager helped us to upgrade the newly renovated Pinnacle Villa, which is still possible. Seeking truth from facts, the service attitude is good)
As a local veteran hot spring, it is indeed good, with many pools, very private, and genuine hot spring water. If you are not far away, you can choose to go to the bath alone, the weather is not hot at night, there are hot and cold pools!
Put down the newly renovated Pinnacle Villa, if it hasn't been renovated, don't put it away, alas!

msg:作為廈門老牌温泉度假酒店，温泉可圈可點，也有新的裝修區域，也可以有私密的家庭泡池供家庭選擇，整體度假風格，環境很好，可以選擇別墅有單獨泡池，也有親子房等供選擇，酒店二樓有獨立的小朋友玩樂空間，滑滑梯，海洋球等，還有可以打電動的地方，度假還是很棒的
