msg:When we arrived at the quarry it started to rain. The luggage pickup service was done by a middle aged man who seemed like a really nice guy, however he was ill-equipped for rainy weather. We walked through the rain and the luggage was completely soaked. (No buggy except for government related service, so the man used a trolley)  the hotel room seemed sparse for its price, we booked the suite with panorama view. The night view is fantastic, but the toilet is easily choked, the staff came up to unclog the toilet explained that the piping was since time ancient and therefore cannot take any tissue. Luckily we only booked one night. Also the trip booking system seemed to hold the $$ for ‘preauthtorisation’ and the hotel requires you to pay again for the actual payment. Quite a number of guests were also buffled by this arrangement. Do take note of you are paying a guarantee to trip.com or the actual hotel. Only one young male staff was very enthusiastic and helpful, the rest did not seem like they want to work here. The atmosphere at front desk was generally quite gloomy.

msg:From service to location, from scenery to facilities, to hygiene, this hotel has shown impeccable quality. The service of the hotel is impressive. From check-in to check-out, every detail is full of humanized care. The staff was smiling and friendly. Not only did they check in quickly, but they also took the initiative to introduce us to the attractions and food around the hotel. During our stay, they also provided 24-hour room service to ensure that our needs were met in a timely manner. This meticulous service made me feel very warm and comfortable. The location of the hotel is excellent. It is located in the core area of ​​Gulangyu Island, with beautiful surroundings and convenient transportation. Whether you want to explore the historical sites on the island or taste the local food, it is very convenient to start from the hotel. In addition, the hotel is close to the seaside, and you can enjoy the magnificent sea view in just a few minutes' walk. In terms of facilities, the hotel has also done an excellent job. The room is spacious and bright, the decoration is luxurious and elegant, and it is equipped with various modern facilities. The bed is soft and comfortable, which makes people sleep well all night. In short, it is a perfect experience. I will stay here again. Thank you for the hospitality.

msg:I came to Gulangyu on a rainy day this time, thinking that my enthusiasm for traveling would be dampened. I didn't expect that the hotel I accidentally saw on Ctrip would give me a huge surprise. The hotel is located just under the Sunlight Rock, and it is only a few steps away from the core attractions. At the same time, the hotel provides luggage pick-up service at the pier. After arriving at the pier, I can easily go around Gulangyu first, and my luggage has been delivered to the hotel. There is no need to worry about bringing too many things to affect the trip. Secondly, the hotel's afternoon tea is excellent from quality to service. It is delicious and beautiful. Sitting in the glass restaurant to eat afternoon tea is so comfortable that I don't want to leave the hotel at all. The breakfast on the second day was more exquisite and tasted better. It is a hotel that I will always come back to.

msg:Accommodation on Gulangyu Island. I read other users' comments and chose this one blindly. After booking, I called and the housekeeper added WeChat to tell me about travel arrangements... The pier can send luggage once... This is good. The location of the hotel is very good. It is indeed very convenient to go to Sunlight Rock and Shuzhuang Garden. There are also many places to eat around. On the first day of the island, I chose to take the electric bus to Shuzhuang Garden and then walk up the stairs (but I will definitely not know the direction for the first time, so I suggest waiting at a convenience store) and let the B&B staff pick me up... This way I won't go wrong! The hotel is not big, but the layout is also thoughtful. The room has a balcony, which is good and suitable for relaxation! Breakfast and afternoon tea are very thoughtful! The taste is delicious! I will choose this hotel next time I go to Gulangyu!

msg:Very good hotel, very good housekeepers Zehua and Fuan, very good environment!!!
From booking, picking up luggage, check-in, to check-out, they are all very professional, kind and gentle. They will send out precautions in advance, remind you to book the boat ticket, and make an appoin**ent for picking up luggage. The uncle who picked up the luggage was very talkative. When checking in, there were very delicious winter melon tea and sour plum soup, as well as candy. I checked in late that day and there was no afternoon tea, but the housekeeper made up for it for me the next day.
Breakfast and afternoon tea are very good and delicious, and I like the benefits such as welcome snacks that come with them.
After a day of shopping, I sneaked back to the hotel to take a bath, and then followed the forest path in front of the hotel. It took three minutes to reach the beach. It was very beautiful. There was no one on the beach at 11 o'clock in the evening, which was especially suitable for listening to the waves and being in a daze.
The room is also very good, very quiet, very large and very clean! ! Very design-conscious, I really like this old-style house style, and it still retains the original floor tiles, which gives it a sense of age. I really like it. I liked it so much that I stayed there the next day. They also helped me upgrade the room type because there was a vacancy. They also helped me send the courier after I checked out. Thank you very much!

msg:This stay at Linghai Hotel was the most amazing stay experience during the trip. The meticulous service of the store, the charm of the old building, as well as the exquisite breakfast, afternoon tea and laundry service all left a deep impression on us. The housekeeper will contact us in advance to send the information about landing on the island before check-in, which saves us time to make a guide. This is very considerate for outsiders who are unfamiliar with the place. By the way, the hotel also provides a free luggage pick-up service at the pier, which is very suitable, otherwise it is really difficult to walk with a large suitcase. The housekeeper service is very considerate. When we sit in the yard at night, they will take the initiative to provide us with mosquito repellent. When we check in at the store, the special tea we drink is very delicious. I drank 3 cups in one breath, hahahaha, the hotel environment and hygiene should also be very good, and the facilities are very charming in an old building, very close to the sea and Sunlight Rock. The overall stay can feel the attentiveness and thoughtfulness, which makes people enjoy the vacation very comfortably. I will come again next time.

It is very romantic and literary, and it is also "backed by mountains and in front of the sea". This should be what travel should be like. The sun is slanting down, and you can enjoy afternoon tea comfortably and feel the nature and slow pace.
The waiter is very enthusiastic and kind. He will contact in advance and arrange to pick up the luggage at the hotel. Afternoon tea and breakfast are freshly made. (And it is free) This is rare in the hotels I have stayed in. If you pursue quality life, if you also want to experience a villa with a history of more than 100 years, if you want to have a modern interior decoration style, then you can consider staying, "even if it is other hotels under Linggan on the island", this is my favorite hotel among all the hotels I have traveled to, and the location is also very good. Anyway, Gulangyu is not big, and it takes a few minutes to walk around.
I will come to Gulangyu again next time, and I will come to Linggan again!

Let me talk about the hotel environment. We booked a sea view room so the room was very damp, really very damp!! The quilt felt like it could be wrung out of water. People from the north really can't stand it.
In addition, my expectations were a bit high and I felt that the room was not worth it. There was no desk in the huge room, and I could only stand in front of the dressing mirror to put on makeup. There was also a strange smell in the room, accompanied by moisture, which made people feel very bad.
Although the hotel service staff had a good attitude and arranged free luggage delivery, I still felt that the price and living experience did not match, and I would not choose it again in the future.

The villa is a three-story building, and the linked arched porches freeze the century-old Xiamen Bay seascape one by one. On the first floor, you can enjoy the courtyard, and the layers of courtyards are like a small maze. On the second floor, you can enjoy the light, lean on the railing and gather, as high as the trees, and the sea in the distance is looming. On the third floor, you can enjoy the sea from sunrise to sunset, and never miss it.
The staff is warm and thoughtful, and the breakfast is exquisite, nutritious and delicious! They also considerately upgraded me to a sea view room, haha!

msg:Due to the off-season, we were given a free room upgrade! The view is very good. You can see the port and the sea from the balcony at night, and the breeze is very comfortable. The room card is also very unique and made of wood. Unfortunately, it is custom-made and cannot be kept as a souvenir. The overall style is southern-style, and the color combination is very eye-catching. The breakfast the next day was also quite rich, including grains, fruits, etc., I was very full hahahaha! I am very satisfied with the 680 package I purchased and enjoyed this service, which also includes but is not limited to introducing attractions and carrying luggage, etc. Highly recommended!

msg:The entire hotel is a very charming and contemporary villa located higher up on Gulangyu Island. We booked a top-floor loft with a large balcony outside. The view is wide and the scenery is pleasant. The vegetation is dense and the air is fresh. You can sit on the balcony and watch. It is so healing to have a clear sky for a while. The hotel service staff are warm and friendly, helping to carry luggage trolleys, and proactively greeting guests and asking for their needs. It was a good experience during my stay at the hotel. It's just a few minutes' walk from the hotel to the beach. The hotel provides sand digging tools. The children like it very much. If I have the opportunity to visit Gulangyu in the future, I will choose Linghai!

msg:Linghai Hotel is a chain hotel in Gulangyu Island. The hotel we stayed in is located near Sunlight Rock and Shuzhuang Garden. It is a single-family villa and is very quiet. I booked a sea view room, which can directly face the sea and enjoy the blooming flowers in spring. The room is clean and tidy, and the bathroom and balcony are spacious. It is very pleasant to listen to the sound of the waves and taste the aroma of black tea on the balcony.
The hotel also has many hidden benefits, such as you can borrow sand digging tools for free, and the beach is a 5-minute walk away. Children can just spend the whole afternoon digging. Afternoon tea is provided every day, including 2 small cakes and a pot of tea. There is also free laundry service, both dry cleaning and drying, which is very convenient.
On the day you first arrive at the hotel, the hotel provides free luggage transportation to the hotel. However, you will have to pay extra to transport your luggage on the return trip.

When you get to the pier, there will be a trolley driver to transport your luggage to the hotel, which is very convenient.
Whether it is the afternoon tea or travel photography, it is very solid. The butler is very enthusiastic in reminding and making flexible arrangements to prevent guests from missing out on the benefits.
From booking a room to leaving the island, the housekeeper is extremely enthusiastic and responsive to all requests.

It's just a little far away from the pier, but very close to Sunlight Rock and the beach.

In the early morning, you can walk to the beach to watch the sunrise and come back just in time to have breakfast. The time is just right. Although it is a 10-minute walk from Sanqiutian Pier, the hotel provided a thoughtful luggage pick-up service, which allowed us to easily stroll around the island after disembarking and see the statue of Zheng Chenggong under the sunset. The most noteworthy thing is the attentive service of several young staff, which made us feel at ease. . I will definitely stay here again if I have the chance to visit Gulangyu Island again.

Guests will be contacted one day in advance if they have any luggage that needs to be picked up. When you get off Sanqiutian Pier, there will be an uncle waiting to pick up your luggage. You can walk to it. You can also take a shuttle bus from the hotel to Shuzhuang Garden and walk for a few minutes, which is very convenient. We chose a room with a large terrace. The hotel's environment is so beautiful. There are big banyan trees and a star fruit tree in the courtyard. The only inconvenient thing may be that there is no elevator, but it is inevitable in old villas. The guy at the front desk was very nice to help us carry our luggage. Every girl and guy in the hotel was very nice and responsive to our requests. There is a dryer that can help wash clothes, and they are neatly folded when they are returned. The afternoon tea is also very exquisite, and the breakfast is also very rich. Sitting on the terrace in the evening and enjoying the sea breeze and listening to the sound of the waves and the wind blowing the leaves is simply beautiful~

Special praise 👍The front desk guy at Linghai Hotel is attentive and considerate and makes you feel at home. Not only did he upgrade our family of three to a double room for free, he also took the initiative to help wash, dry, fold and deliver the clothes to the room, and gave us afternoon tea and souvenirs. Haha, so many surprises, it is really a model among B&Bs👍

Since I have the habit of getting up early every day for morning exercise, I exercise on the second floor platform in the morning, overlooking the beautiful coastline, which makes people feel relaxed and happy😄😄😄

The next morning, I unexpectedly discovered that the most beautiful beach on the island is right below the Linghai Hotel🏖️. It’s close to the sea and quiet. I’m really good at choosing hotels✌️✌️✌️

On the day of check-in, the lady enthusiastically led us to the room and gave an introduction, letting us know that this building was built in 1919 and was the former residence of King Sugar. The hotel is located under Sunlight Rock, and the environment is quiet in the bustle. The room is very clean. I especially like the floor and wall tiles in the room, which has a sense of age. What I feel most deeply is that every staff member of the B&B is kind and courteous, and the responses are timely and clear. , especially a young man wearing black-rimmed glasses. When we were out looking for food and leaving the B&B last night, he specially came to spray us with mosquito repellent. He said that there were many mosquitoes on the island at night, which was really surprising and touching. This time gave us a very good experience, and we hope to come again if we have the opportunity!

The hotel has a free service of checking luggage to the hotel (just pick up, there seems to be a fee for delivery. It is strongly recommended to use it. It is too tiring to carry luggage to the hotel by yourself. , you can pull it by yourself when walking down the mountain). When you arrive at the hotel, the waiter is very enthusiastic. There are ice-cold drinks at the front desk to quench your thirst. It is very comfortable to have a drink at the hotel. The waiter will help carry the luggage to the room.

Facilities: The hotel was renovated from an old building, and the overall style of the ancient building is retained. The facilities in the hotel rooms are relatively new, because it is on an island, and the water pipes are laid. If there are many people using hot water, you may have to wait. meeting.


Hygiene: Hygiene is very good, but because of the lush vegetation nearby, there are many mosquitoes. The hotel provides mosquito repellent water, so remember to spray it.


Environment: The hotel itself has a very good environment. It is very close to Sunlight Rock, Zheng Chenggong Memorial Hall, Shuzhuang Garden, International Lettering Art Museum (the address on the hand-drawn map is wrong), Aberdeen Back Beach, and Longtou Road Snack Street.

Transportation: It is strongly recommended to steal from Sanqiutian Pier. The road over to Neicuoao Pier is too difficult.


Breakfast: Breakfast is in the form of a set meal. There are not too many types. It is quite exquisite and tastes okay. There is also milk, soy milk, coffee, fruit and bread.

Afternoon tea: Before 16 o'clock, the taste is quite good, and the photos are not bad. You can still try it if it comes with a set meal, but I don't recommend buying it yourself.

Taking photos: If you are given photos, I think 5 photos are enough. If you have the skills, you can actually take photos yourself.

To sum up, the hotel is very good overall and I recommend everyone to give it a try.

If you’re tired from walking, you can go back to the hotel and sit in the yard to enjoy afternoon tea. It’s also very quiet and beautiful. Walking down from the hotel is the beach, which is super convenient. It is next to all the attractions. The breakfast is simple, but there are both Chinese and Western products that warm the heart and stomach. One 😂 The most important thing is that the little brother Gaga at the front desk is handsome and has a very good attitude. The main reason is that he is handsome...

msg:Taking the opportunity of a business trip to stay for two nights can be regarded as a dream trip. I came to Gulangyu Island for the first time in 19 years. I stayed in Mofan for one night. I liked it very much. I also learned about other hotels on the island. There was Linghai during the semester. I went to see it the next day and booked a room, but suddenly The itinerary changed and I couldn't stay. I just watched it from a distance. Today, more than three years later, I finally got my wish. Although it is only the most basic room (101), the service I get is the same. How good it is can only be experienced by myself. Anyway, as a hotel practitioner, I especially want to learn. The next day, I wandered around the island casually, and went to see four other houses, 1930, 1931 and Linggan, and I forgot the name of another one, and chatted a lot with the young lady of Linggan, and was laughed at saying that we came to inspect it specially. His hotel, in all fairness, is really doing a good job and worth learning from.

msg:The entire hotel is a private old house with a century-old history and not many rooms. I chose it based on my feeling after looking at the pictures and rankings, and experienced the penthouse, sea view, terrace, and the large Thai-style bathroom that I have never lived in. The room is nearly 100 square meters. After staying, I found that I could see the starry sky lying on the bed. It is unexpected that the hotel provides tea sets and tea leaves. After all, the room rate is not very expensive. In addition to free drinks, fruits, and afternoon tea, it also provides laundry detergent, which is not available in other hotels. Because the clothes are wet when you go out in hot weather, use laundry detergent Washing clothes is much more convenient than soap. This company is completely standing on the customer's point of view to feel the customer's needs and meet them. The beach in front of the hotel is also very beautiful. Standing on the terrace and looking up is the highest point of Sunlight Rock, a famous scenic spot in Gulangyu Island. I guess the scenery above is similar to what you can see from the terrace, that is, you don’t need to go to the highest point of the scenic spot to see it from the room. Yes, and save on tickets. After leaving the hotel, I ordered the same hair dryer, and it feels good after using it. When I go back, I will probably recall the experience in Linghai when I use the same hair dryer. "Inspiration from a Piece of Sea" is so beautiful!

msg:Service: The service is really top-notch. From the initiative to contact you the night before, you can go to the pier to pick up your luggage, to set foot on the island, and then to the outlying island with meticulous five-star service. For a change of clothes, you can wash and dry them for the waiter at any time and take them back; help you put hot water in the bathtub; do your best in the travel photography service; pack meals and drinking water for me who needs to catch a cruise. The high temperature of 38 degrees and the peak of summer tourists come to Gulangyu Island. If you don't choose the right hotel, you should not be able to experience a satisfactory trip.

Environment: Quiet amidst the hustle and bustle, the location is wonderful. This is something I didn't expect, although it's a long way from Sanqiutian Wharf. But the location of the hotel is absolutely perfect. Go down the stone steps opposite the hotel, three minutes to the most golden location on the beach. Next to the beach is Shuzhuang Garden, the Suzhou garden by the sea. Less than 50 meters below the hotel is the entrance of Sunlight Rock. 200 meters above the hotel is the Zheng Chenggong Memorial Hall. My one-night stay and check-in tour can all be satisfied. The above are the essence of the history and natural scenery of Gulangyu Island. I'm not interested in attractions like Corner Meets Love.

Hygiene: The hotel yard is not big but there are people sweeping the floor all the time, and the rooms are also cleaned very well.

Facilities: The TV is not easy to use, but the service is good. The guy on duty uses his mobile phone to cast the screen, and also helps put the hot water. Satisfy my wish of listening to the movie music evening in the Greater Bay Area while soaking in the bath. Enjoy both body and mind to sweep away the fatigue of travel.

Meals: The afternoon tea dessert is very good, and the tea and coffee are also of good quality. I drank a little too much, and I didn't sleep all night, both ways. Breakfast is average and needs to be improved.

Finally, I would like to thank Xiao Chen for his butler service from the beginning to the end. His thoughtful and detailed care made my rush schedule orderly and at home. Thanks to the glasses brother who helped to cast the screen and borrowed the phone for one night, and thanks to the kitchen brother who has been helping to take pictures. There are also bluestone roads and luggage masters who hurriedly drag luggage around the island under the high temperature.

Although the price is not cheap, I have seen people asking if there is room available. There are only 14 rooms in the hotel, luckily I booked a week in advance. Next time in off-season, come again to experience the sea view room with super large balcony.

The sea view room can overlook the sea and the opposite Haicang District. Looking down, there is only one road at the entrance, and there is a banyan forest beside the road , except the green is orange walls and gray tiles, there is a road leading directly to the beach at the door, and you can reach the beach in 5 minutes. The big bed in the sea view room is 2 meters. I was a little worried that we two and two would not be able to take a nap, but I didn't expect to sleep quite well. Comfortable. There is nothing to say about the service. You can pick up your luggage at the pier if you make an appoin**ent in advance. Although it is a bit far away, it is worth it. You will hand everyone a bottle of water when you enter the door, and then someone will send it to the room. The room is exactly the same as the photo, clean and spacious. There are two children Two sets of special toiletry sets are provided, the breakfast is also exquisite, and the drinks in the refrigerator are complete and can be refilled. It is completely five-star hardware and service!

msg:#How to please yourself by taking a walk-and-go trip during the May 1st holiday of people following the crowd# There is no other strategy, only one, that is to find a quiet hotel in the middle of the noise and stay for a few days, and don’t go anywhere to join in the fun.

For example, this time we chose this one by mistake.

This is the old residence of Mr. Guo Chunyang, the legendary sugar king in modern history. It faces the sea on the half-mountain of Sunlight Rock in Gulangyu Island. It has been nearly a hundred years.

Now a local company bought it and renovated it to become an Internet celebrity homestay.

The location of the hotel is excellent. Although it is not close to the pier, the uphill is the Sunshine Rock, and the downhill is the seaside beach. It takes two steps to go to Longtou Road for shopping and eating. When I think of these things, I feel full of happiness in an instant.

The hardware is comfortable, though not luxurious. For example, the balcony is really super big, the scenery is very pleasant, the gauze curtain is white enough, hanging and floating, the dappled sunlight shines in, and soft music is played, whether it is outdoors or indoors, a cup of tea is fragrant with a book, It's the happiest time. At night, the bathroom is spacious, and singing can echo, as if returning to ancient Rome. After taking a shower, I jumped onto the bed. The warmth wrapped in the softness of the bed made foreigners feel a sense of security.
​
​The service is considerate. There is free pick-up and drop-off for luggage to the pier, and there are daily free fruit drinks in the refrigerator. Tea sets and tea are also available at will. The free breakfast and afternoon tea are also well matched, and the arrangement is also beautiful because of the care.
​
​Well, in short, it is strongly recommended to all old mothers who take their babies for a walk.

msg:This hotel is the best choice for tourists to stay, and it has an excellent location in a quiet place. The front desk of the hotel is full of handsome and cheerful young people, the aunts in the rooms are friendly, and the service is warm and thoughtful. There are many scenic spots around the hotel, and the service brother will give you a detailed introduction to the map, which is convenient for planning routes when visiting. When going out for fun, go down the small steps and walk up the road on the left for five or six minutes, and you will arrive at the bustling Longtou Road Food Street, where the two restaurants of the hotel are located. There are food deliveries for guests when they arrive at the store. I feel very happy after tasting it myself. Well, I hope to come again next time. The hotel is one minute away from the beach and you can go to the beach behind Aberdeen. It is a good place to take children to dig sand and play. Five or six minutes to the left along the coast is the Piano Museum in Shuzhuang Garden. I highly recommend you to visit it. It is magnificent and grand. . To the right is the Meihua Bathing Beach. When the weather is fine, you can watch a nice sunset. In short, it is a word, value for money, worth having.
The only downside is that I haven't lived here for a long time, so I will stay here for a few more days when I have time next time. 😁😁😁

First of all, the luggage after landing on the island can help us take it to the hotel, which really reduces a lot of trouble for me. The staff has been really considerate from check-in to check-out! Because I take care of my children, there are so many things to do! ! But also very patient to help me solve the problem! Do you dare to think about making a copy of fried rice for you alone after ten o'clock! I was really touched! With a little bit of focus, next time I come to Xiamen, I will still choose Linghai! !

Many travel bloggers do not recommend living on the island, but I think it is necessary to live on the island. You can stagger the flow of people. If we start shopping early in the morning, we can contract the entire beach!
The breakfast and afternoon tea were very good, and the travel photography service was also very enthusiastic. At the end, they gave us mineral water and snacks, and warmly showed us the way to see if we arrived at the next stop safely. Very very considerate, I like it so much!

It's just that there is no previous review that you can hear the waves crashing on the shore. The hotel is actually far away from the coast, and you can only overlook the sea view. In addition, the facilities are a bit rudimentary, which does not match the price of one or two thousand yuan a night. In addition, the room does not have a screen door, and there are too many mosquitoes, so it is impossible to enjoy the sea breeze.

Service: The staff have several roles, most of them are young men, but they are very polite and sincere. One thing was very touching. On the day of check-out, I saw my parents carrying luggage. The young man climbed up the stairs step by step to carry the luggage for my parents. The young man saw sincerity in his eyes. The staff here don't talk much, but they can respond to any questions you ask them. They don't talk much, definitely not the indifference of some big hotel staff, they are all doing things seriously.
Afternoon tea: fruits, cakes, tea, beautifully prepared and delicious.
Room: The decoration is very stylish, I like it~
Luggage: 2-3 days before departure to Gulangyu Island, the hotel will contact you and tell you that there will be a master to help you with the luggage. By the way, the master is very nice and polite.
When you leave the hotel, the hotel will bring you 2 bottles of water, which is very thoughtful and has been considered for you. On such a hot day, it takes 15-20 minutes to walk to Sanqiutian Wharf, and you will definitely be thirsty. The hotel will also prepare souvenirs, which are delicious and taste better than the time-honored brands outside.

The service is very good and the location of the hotel is also very good. It is an old house with years, exquisite Stylish, just under Sunlight Rock, you can listen to the sound of the piano and watch the waves. The room has a big bed and a huge terrace. It is very comfortable to live in.

It’s like returning to the beautiful courtyard a hundred years ago. The room is clean, the afternoon tea and breakfast are very good.

msg:The attitude was reversed before and after, and the behavior was extremely bad! The worst review for the first time. At the beginning of the booking, the overall docking was okay. We also arranged for personnel to pick up the hotel from the dock and asked about the arrival time. But I didn't expect that the experience after checking out would turn around. Because I booked 3 rooms for my family, I later paid for an upgrade at the front desk and asked for an invoice to be issued after check-out. It took 3 days, so forget it. I was also on a business trip out of town at the time, so I didn't check it immediately. Later, I found out a week later that the amount was wrong, so I provided both the order and payment records to the front desk for changes. Promised to verify, but after 10 hours, told the accountant to take a break, verified the next day, and waited for another 4 days, still no reply. I don’t know what problems the accountant encountered. This kind of reversal has stopped the "falling out" approach. How can I make another order!

Before arriving at the store, the staff will contact you to inform you of precautions, ask about pick-up and drop-off services, etc. The hotel is located in a relatively high position on Gulangyu Island. There are many old trees above it, forming a good location for enjoying the shade. Sitting in the yard every day is the most pleasant time. Listening to the sea is really great.

The hotel turns left ⬅️ 100 meters to Sunshine Rock, and the beach is 2 minutes away from the steps. On the left hand side of the beach is Shuzhuang Garden, which is very convenient! The service of the hotel is nothing to say, the hotel started to contact me the day before I went to the island, and arranged for the master who picked up the luggage. When I arrived at the hotel, I introduced the itinerary in detail. We missed the afternoon tea when we went out to play. I also managed to find a way to send us a copy, thank you very much for their thoughtful service! Let’s talk about the follow-up photo provided by the hotel. We made an appoin**ent to take pictures one day in advance. The photographer Xiao Li arrived at the store in advance and waited for us to complete the check-in procedures. He helped us carry our belongings when taking pictures, and accompanied us to take a lot of beautiful photos at the hotel and the beach. ! All in all, a worthwhile trip 👍

msg:After experiencing Linghai Hotel, I couldn't help but write down my inner feelings. Linghai Hotel is the best resort hotel on the island, and I will definitely come back next time! First, the location is excellent. At the foot of Sunlight Rock, classical buildings are surrounded by shady old trees, as if living in a forest. It is very close to go to Sunlight Rock to climb a height and look far away. It is also very close to walk to Shuzhuang Garden, Piano Museum, and walk to the sea. Second, the view is wide. You can see the sea from the balcony or even lie on the bed in the room, blowing the sea breeze It feels good to sleep! Third, the service quality is good. Whether it is the quality of the waiters at the front desk or in the restaurant, they are all good. Especially it feels so good to dine outdoors with the sea breeze blowing!

The hotel provides breakfast. There are not many guests but the speed is very slow. The coffee, milk and fruit are basically unavailable and need to be improved.
Going to the island provides a luggage delivery service, but going out of the island requires you to push your luggage or spend money. The experience is not very good.

First of all, the location on Gulangyu Island is very good, close to the food street, and also very close to Sunlight Rock. The external environment of the hotel is very good, there is a big yard, and the hotel is considerate Afternoon tea was delivered; the decoration style matches the original building, the room size is relatively large, the mattress is just right, and the bed size is also very large; the toiletries are of good quality, the same as the Golden Eagle Summit Hotel where I stayed
There are two things I hope the hotel can refresh. One is to prepare a larger trash can, and the second hot water system is an electric water heater. I feel that after one person uses too much, the second person needs to wait for about 15 minutes. I hope these two points can be improved one time

Walk around and go back to the hotel. The accommodation experience was great. There were noisy children, and the front desk quickly stopped it. The seaside room is very quiet at night, a quiet place amidst the noise. The room is very large. You can drink tea and enjoy the sea breeze on the private balcony to relax and relax. Some suggestions, it is best to put a shelf in the room that can hold suitcases, otherwise it can only be placed on the floor. The bathroom is so big that it is a waste. You can put a small dressing table and a stool next to the sink. All in all, it adds a lot of points to our trip to Gulangyu Island, and I wish you a better and better New Year!

msg:This hotel is considered to be very expensive on Gulangyu Island, but the price/performance ratio is very low, so it is not recommended.
Let me talk about the advantages first. The sea view room has a good view and the room is tidy. Although it is old, it is clean. The beds are also relatively comfortable.
Breakfast is a meal, very simple, anyway, there are too many delicious foods on the island, it doesn't matter if you eat breakfast in the hotel or not.
Then I have to complain about the service, which surprised me. Before I came, the hotel added me on WeChat and told me how to get to the hotel after going to the island. It is said that the shuttle bus on the island is only open until 4 pm, but I got a ticket at 5 pm, so the hotel told me that I could only drag my luggage from the pier to the hotel, or call an errand (even provided errand phone number) took my luggage to the hotel and I found it myself. If I didn't stay in the hotel for comparison, I thought this is the rule on the island. If you don't have a car, you can drag your luggage by yourself. But it wasn't until I checked into the later hotel that I knew that the welcome and delivery service was still provided. With such a high price, I don't have any sense of service for the sake of customers, so I'm quite convinced... Maybe it's because of my reputation? I don't know, and I would definitely not recommend it anyway. The room service can't be called, and the front desk is unbelievably cold when checking in... It's rare to step on Ctrip, but this time it's firm, everyone be careful.

I came back from Xiamen yesterday
Listening is the first night of my stay in Gulangyu after ten years
From the phone call not long after placing the order, to adding WeChat later
Tell me the precautions for landing on the island How to buy ferry tickets and island landscape tickets Listening is the only one that provides the most detailed information
Follow-up also always pay attention to the customer's feelings

Abu listening to the sense staff, a Fujian girl
Thank you for the perfect impression of my trip to Gulangyu with my family
I would like to call the service you provide "Gulangyu Ceiling"
Very shrewd and considerate
It doesn't feel unnatural at all
The moment you want to help, she has appeared in front of you before you even open your mouth, you can see your love for this job
Only work you really love can give without reservation and continue to do it every day
Wish you can realize your dream soon
Thank you for giving us a wonderful first day of vacation
Also because this starting point is too high, there is a huge gap in the feelings of other homestays later.
Fortunately, I stayed at the brother's house "Lijiazhuang" on the last night.
That gave our vacation a perfect ending

thank you
Looking forward to the next meeting

The hotel is just below Sunlight Rock, follow the sightseeing car and tell the driver to get off at the Sanatorium of the Military Region, and then walk up the steps to arrive. The afternoon tea provided by the homestay is also good. The freshly ground coffee in the breakfast shop is delicious, but I am a little uncomfortable eating cold potato shreds in the morning 😂 I hope to add steamed buns or something in the future.

msg:1. The plug in the room is loose and charging is inconvenient.
2. The toilet in the room has no ventilation
*3. There are dirty towels in the toilet cupboard that were used by previous guests!
How can a hotel that costs nearly 900 a night allow guests to check in with peace of mind when the most basic room cleaning is not done well. I discovered it when I was about to take a shower at 23:00 after checking in. After that, I called the front desk to deal with it. I was also very worried about the hygiene of the room, but it was too late and I was too tired, so I thought of solving it the next day.
*4. Before we checked out at 11:30 in the morning, a staff member (female) swiped her card to enter our room. Before we checked out, she just swiped her card and came in. After asking, she said she had a wrong room number. Yes, I retreated to the next room. This is a very outrageous thing. Entering the room without confirming the room information before entering has a great impact on the privacy of the guests. Hope to have good training

When I reported these issues to the staff afterwards, my attitude was very sincere and I hope to properly handle the above issues. However, hotel hygiene is really the foundation of a hotel. Even the most basic things are not done well so that guests can stay with peace of mind.

In the end, we would like to thank him for sending our luggage to the pier very considerately.

The design of this room is like that of a 50-yuan small hotel, but the price is more expensive than a five-star hotel. Such a good location and scenery are in vain.

We understand that it may not be so convenient for Gulangyu to send to the same city. At any rate, you can send a SF Express to arrive the next day? As a result, it was sent to Jingdong. The new brother who was on the phone at 6.18 on Saturday said that he was sorry. He communicated at 1:00 and sent it to the hotel at 5:00 to help pay the shipping fee as compensation. As a result, the Jingdong Express you sent was sent on Saturday on 6.18. , 6.21 Monday at 1:00 noon? ? ? ? Also sent to pay? ? ? ? ? ? I want to say, it's really well done.

🔔Service: The front desk is very enthusiastic. If you don’t understand what to do by boat, sightseeing or eating, you can consult the front desk. The hotel also sends a map -> Although the map is reversed from north to south
🍃Environment: It is very exclusive, there is no noise in the downtown area, and the surrounding are also converted from luxury houses, so there will be no noise; you can get up in the morning with the sound of birds; the room decoration is naturally not comparable to high-end hotels, but everything is available
🚗 Transportation: Between the exit and entrance of Sunlight Rock, go to the beach and walk down the stairs for 5 minutes, to the snack street for 10 minutes, just go to eat rice rolls after running in the morning; choose to walk on the flat road without going over the mountain and take the stairs, dragging Luggage takes about 25 minutes; I read the comments before I stayed and I was dissatisfied with this, but after thinking about it, if I can't walk on Gulangyu Island... I can't do it when I roam on Gulangyu Island, so I don't mind.
🧹Hygiene: The bathtub is big enough, but unfortunately the water heater is for domestic use, so you have to boil two pots of hot water and add it to it
The store owner has improved my opinion that homestays are unreliable 😂 Gulangyu is suitable for slowing down and walking around aimlessly. I am glad to change the itinerary and stay for one more night, thank you for your hospitality!

The hotel is surrounded by mountains and faces the sea. The environment is not to be said. It is a bit troublesome to reach the hotel. You have to take a sightseeing bus (there is no time for the sightseeing bus to check out the next day), then go up a long flight of steps, carry your luggage in the sun It's really painful to climb so many stairs, but it is very convenient for children to play on the beach near the beach. When I checked in, I called the front desk in advance and told the front desk that we had three luggage, and only one person came to pick it up. Fi password, I asked aloud where the afternoon tea was before I ate it. Afternoon tea is not bad, breakfast is really rough, sorry for the price. To be honest, the decoration of the hotel is a bit rough and simple. It is not as good as the 800 Xujiayuan (closed) where I lived when I first came. Except for the sea view is acceptable and the bed is very comfortable, there is no other impression that makes people feel special. Anyway, I was very familiar with the road to the island when I was leaving, so I just walked to the pier with my luggage while eating. In short, in general.

msg:The hotel is under Sunlight Rock, very close to Sunlight Rock, surrounded by trees, very quiet ~ suitable for leisure vacation. The room is big, the bathroom is big, the bed is big, the bed linen is clean and comfortable, the front desk service is very thoughtful and warm, suitable for parent-child and couple vacation travel. This time, because I brought an elderly person, I booked a courtyard twin room, which is completely enough for sleep. There is a big fan window next to the bed. The courtyard outside is quiet and very comfortable. It only takes ten minutes from the hotel to walk to the bustling Longtou Road Snack Street, which is very convenient~ Going down from the hotel entrance is the beach, and Shuzhuang Garden is nearby to play. After children dig sand and play, they go back to the hotel to wash and wash. The elderly and children feel good.

msg:Transportation 🦶 After arriving at Sanqiutian Wharf, take a sightseeing bus to the military sanatorium station. There will be people from the hotel who will pick us up. It is important to mention that the person who came to pick us up is very nice, because the island is very sultry these two days. I brought three small bottles of sour plum juice and helped with the luggage along the way. Thank you very much! Next, the transportation on the island can only rely on two legs. To be honest, the hotel is located in a high position, so climbing up and down every day is very tiring for me, who usually does not exercise.
Hotel environment 🏡 A total of 16 rooms, 6 of which are sea-view rooms. We stayed in a sea-view room, which is very beautiful. The overall environment of the hotel is also pretty good, quite distinctive.
Meals🥣 As a person who eats lying down, I am quite satisfied with the breakfast. Two kinds of fruits, milk, coffee, and tea are all taken by themselves. Other foods are served by the hotel for one person, including shrimp, beef, mung bean porridge, cucumber, Fried eggs and peanuts are more nutritious and comfortable.
There is afternoon tea in the afternoon, the cakes are delicious, the fruit tea is sweet and sour, and there are some fruits.
Parent-child travel comments 👧 Five minutes down from the hotel is the largest beach on the island, so taking your baby is definitely the best choice. Remember to bring sand digging tools. We go at 5:30 in the morning, or 5:00-6 in the afternoon: Go at 30, children dig sand, adults tread water, it feels super good!
Hotel service 💁‍♂️ Overall satisfaction, smooth communication, patiently explained the walking route around when I first arrived, and sent snacks when I left.
Outlying islands ⛱️ Outlying islands are more painful, you have to drag your luggage and walk to the pier to take a boat. Cooler weather shouldn’t be a problem, July and August are a bit choking.

1. The hardware is great. The room is large and the facilities are new, the bed is big and comfortable, the balcony is large and you can watch the sea, it is very pleasant!
2. The location is great. On Huangyan Road, it takes a few minutes to go to the beach after the port, and to the bustling sections such as Longtou Road in minutes. You can reach the gate of Riguangyan within a hundred meters away, so watching the sunrise can't be more convenient!
3. The service is great. The afternoon tea and minibar are very considerate, and the service staff always respond to the needs of the guests in a timely manner and take the initiative to guide the travel route.

Must stay here again next time!

msg:The service brother of the hotel went to pick us up at the military sanatorium station. The service was very good. He climbed the stairs and helped us with our luggage. We booked a sea-view room. The room was very clean and the balcony was super large. The only drawback was that the room did not have a full-length mirror. Only the bathroom and a mirror were installed a bit high. For those who are not tall, I can only get half of my face. The hotel also offers mini fruit afternoon tea (I want to say why the fruit in Xiamen is so expensive, watermelon costs 8 yuan 250kg) breakfast is one per person, the egg yolk wraps are delicious, unfortunately, the porridge is not accompanied by pickles. The location of the hotel is very good, you can see the sea from the room, and it is very close to Sunlight Rock. Overall is still very good, worth recommending

🍃Environment: It is a comfortable homestay, and the USB charging port in the room is broken and cannot be used.

🔔Service: I booked a Ctrip package, including two breakfasts and one afternoon tea. After booking, the customer service added WeChat to inform the specific address and transportation method, which is not bad. When I wanted to exchange for afternoon tea after arriving at the store, I was told that afternoon tea time had passed, and it was only available until 16:00. We did not pay attention to this reservation. It is recommended that the customer service add a reminder to confirm the check-in information with the guest. The items that the children were looking forward to are gone. In fact, we arrived at the store around 16:06.

After getting off the car at the military sanatorium, the hotel was very considerate and attentive, and asked the housekeeper to come over and pick up the luggage. It takes about 2 minutes from the pick-up station to the hotel.
When they arrived at the hotel, their homemade sour plum soup was very delicious, and the ice-cold sour and sweetness was very thirst quenching and refreshing.
The hotel is near Sunlight Rock, with blue sky, white clouds, red tiles, and green trees forming shades, as well as cicadas and sea breeze lingering in the ears.
The room is clean and hygienic, with umbrellas, electronic scales, drying racks, cold drinks, fruits, and daily necessities complete, all reflecting the store's intentions and thoughtfulness.
The bathroom and toilet are separated from wet and dry, and there is also a disposable toilet cover.

msg:This one is very good, I really want to praise it. The room is very clean and comfortable. The most important thing is that everyone inside is very nice, especially the two little brothers who received us on the first day, which troubled them a lot.
The hotel is located on the mountainside and it is very quiet inside. Walk down for a few minutes to reach the Yellow House Beach, and walk to the left for a few minutes to Sunlight Rock. Note that a few minutes is no more than 5 minutes.
It’s no more than 10 minutes' walk away from Longtou Road, Snack Street. Longtou Road is also widely distributed. How long it takes you to go depends on where you go.
We booked a courtyard room, but unfortunately it was too hot outside and there were so many mosquitoes, so there was no chance to stay in the courtyard. It should be nice in cooler weather.
I am very satisfied with the hotel, that is, Gulangyu Island is currently being renovated, so the experience is not good, and rubbish can be seen everywhere on the beach. It is a pity that the original coastline is very clean.
I hope people who see the scenery don’t pollute the scenery

I hadn't been very accurate when I booked a hotel, and it was more casual, but it was a very unexpected surprise. I booked the room as soon as possible. You will contact me to book a ferry ticket and add contact information. The hotel is located far away. If you take a sightseeing bus to the designated location, someone will come to pick up your checked luggage. It goes well. The reservation will also give you afternoon tea and a hand-painted map of Gulangyu~ Breakfast is also good, Chinese style Yes, I will also recommend sightseeing routes and lightning-proof restaurants. The service is really nothing to say. If you are afraid of too much luggage, you can find their recommended luggage steward. In general, 100 are satisfied! ! !

Special thanks to the waiter, because the three of us stayed in and gave breakfast to the children! The young master was very interested and proposed to circle the island for a week at night.

環境優美：步行5分鐘就能到海邊，晚上靜靜走在街上能聽到海浪聲。早上還能聽到嘰嘰喳喳的鳥叫，心情好不舒暢～ 
服務周到：入住前一天會收到酒店的聯繫電話根據坐船抵港時間安排行李配送。老師傅一個人carry了時間心裏，徒步20多分鐘的上坡路到酒店，減輕了旅客的負擔，真的很感激。酒店員工小哥哥們人帥心善，全程提供周到的服務。早餐很好吃，清清爽爽的，分量正好，光盤行動！
辦理入住時會贈送鼓浪嶼手繪地圖，比船上花5塊錢買的要實用的多，漂亮的多，牛皮紙的地圖，耐得住時間的考驗，也很有紀念意義。

酒店距離有名的日光巖非常近 地理位置沒的説 
再次誇讚酒店服務 體貼入微

入住期間還提供免費洗衣服務，這點讓我更滿意。
除了酒店服務好，地理位置也很棒。離沙灘和日光巖都很近。

環境：酒店整體環境幽靜，離日光巖、菽莊花園等景點都很近，酒店還會贈送手繪地圖。

服務：酒店的小哥哥小姐姐們服務都很周到，而且酒店提供的幫拿行李的服務真是太棒了，一定提前一天和酒店聯繫好，會來人在碼頭接待的。

另提一句酒店贈送的下午茶，兩種小蛋糕各有特點（紅茶/抹茶），奶油很細膩並且不太甜，一定要嘗一下。

酒店衞生一般般，很潮濕，蚊子特別多，用了電蚊香+盤香都不管用，在房間裏打死好多衹蚊子🦟，一晚上咬了十幾個包！酒店的驅蚊水沒味道，噴再多都不管用啊！！！蚊子這個問題超級崩潰！

旺季遇到沒有地方吃早餐，早餐廳非常小，人多了就沒有位置坐，擠在角落裡。

最奇怪的事，退房之後酒店問我有沒有東西忘記拿，然後發了一張碎掉的杯子照片給我，弄的我莫名其妙。。。這是什麼意思？更讓人無語的是，我在碼頭等酒店送行李給我，結果搬運工問我要搬運費？酒店卻從來沒有告知搬運行李去碼頭需要我付費。。。跟酒店溝通後，又説不需要我付費了，這到底是怎麼回事兒？

服務：超級棒，1.有師傅幫忙從碼頭運送行李，特別是我們預訂了到內厝澳碼頭的船票，從內厝澳走過來要途徑一個大坡，真不敢想象拿着行李頂着太陽找酒店到底會怎樣！
2.到酒店的時候錯過了下午茶，但是廚師加班還是提供了，感激！
3.酒店是免費幫忙洗衣服，無論拿取還是送回都會有短訊詢問適合的時間，特別貼心！
環境：老別墅，但沒有破敗感，乾淨整潔！陽台可以穿過樹葉看到海，視野還是很不錯的！離日光巖超級近，可以一早爬山去感受清涼的風和絕佳的體驗感！爬完回來吃個早餐開啟完美一天！
退房時的伴手禮，主動詢問需不需要帶兩瓶水路上喝，特別暖心！
一定會推薦給朋友，下次上島還會選擇這裏！

2.前台小哥哥、小姐姐服務態度巨好，會幫忙提行李，快速辦理入住，走的時候怕我們路上口渴，還送了很多水和廈門小零食，謝謝!
3.酒店房間很乾凈，水吧可以免費喝，特別要誇下吹風機，實現速幹不遠了。
4.酒店離沙灘走幾步就到了，還有音樂節，贊!

호텔은 사진에 나와있는 데로 모든 시설이 훌륭했습니다. 특히 모든 직원들이 밝게 응대해줘서 기분이 참 좋았습니다.
오후에 나오는 애프터눈티 세트도 아쉽게 한번만 이용했지만 차와 케이크 모두 훌륭했어요.
호텔에서 쿠폰을 제공하는 식당 두 곳을 모두 이용했는데 정말 좋았습니다. 친절하고 음식도 맛있었습니다.
여기서도 위쳇으로 친구 추가를 통해서 문의도 하고 많은 정보를 받을 수 있었습니다.
방에서 보이는 전망도 얘기를 안할 수 없네요. 저희가 묵었던 방은 바다가 보이는 꼭대기 방이었는데요. 바다와 일광암이 모두 잘 보여서 만족스러웠어요.
샤먼 쌍둥이 빌딩도 너무 잘 보여서 저녁에 조명쇼도 감상할 수 있어요.
조식을 선택해서 매일 이용했는데요. 맛있고 신선해서 정말 좋았습니다.

很失望2019年在鼓浪屿只住了一晚，所以这次旅行住了四晚。
酒店和照片上一样好，所有的设施都很棒。 我特别高兴，因为所有的工作人员都热情地回应。
不幸的是，我只用过一次下午茶套餐，但茶和蛋糕都很棒。
我去了两家酒店提供优惠券的餐厅，非常棒。 他们很友好而且食物很美味。
在这里，我也可以通过微信加好友来查询并收到很多信息。
我忍不住要说一下房间里的景色。 我们住的房间是顶层的房间，可以看到海景。 我对大海和日光岩的清晰视野感到满意。
厦门双子塔也非常醒目，晚上可以欣赏灯光秀。
我选择了早餐并且每天都用它。 它又美味又新鲜，所以我真的很喜欢它。
다음 구랑위 여행 때도 이용할 계획입니다.

msg:房間很乾凈，地板擦的噌噌發亮，有點小潔癖的我非常滿意😄
雖然在半山腰，被綠意環繞，房間裏沒有黴味，被褥也是乾淨且乾燥；
洗手間也是一樣，沒有水漬那些，哪兒都很新很乾凈；
有一些簡約又優雅的佈置；

服務堪稱完美，被大太陽曬得要暈了，到店辦完入住被告知空調已經開好，被狠狠幸福到🥰無論什麼時候回酒店，前台都有温度剛剛的酸梅湯

下午茶也是超乎意料的好吃（尤其是小白熊）

整個酒店在半山腰，走過來確實有點累人，但是離鼓浪嶼的熱門景點菽莊花園和日光巖都很近，遊玩各個景點之間甚至可以回來吹下空調喘口氣（實在是太熱啦！！）

周邊環繞着黃角蘭樹，正值花季，空氣中浮着的香味實在是太迷人，坐在庭院裏，一直有人來打卡拍照📷

很滿意的一次住店體驗❤️還會再來

msg:環境：酒店環境很好，幽靜雅緻

設施：酒店衞生間設施很不好，先是噴頭水上不去，後來整個衞生間下水都堵了，水滿到外面馬桶區域，很臟，讓服務員臨時過來清理，後來發現別的房間也有投訴下水問題。衞生間的掛鈎很少，沒法掛換洗衣服，房間桌子也沒有，衹有一個茶几，東西沒地方放，連坐下來休息寫點東西的地方都沒有。這個價格跟五星級酒店差不多，但是服務完全趕不上五星級酒店。
服務：水災後店長臨時過來清理，服務還是挺好的，希望以後儘量多在一些軟性的服務體驗上下功夫。

msg:縱然不捨離開鼓浪嶼，但還是要啟程回滬了。給小姑娘説了明年再來，仍入住我最喜歡的這個房間。綜合比較，這個酒店大可放心：1. 四層樓均未設定30平以下小户型，所以房間數很少，入住人員自然少。2. 賓館門牆很高，而且賓館門前路面開發的寬而平坦。3. 必須刷房卡才能進出大門。4.0選擇這個酒店的客人追求靜謐，所以也不會打擾別人。住了三晚，雖然滿房，我就沒聽到其他房客説話聲。房間隔音效果也特別好，沒在房間聽到過外面腳步聲。6.賓館一樓院子和二樓大堂的燈晚上一直開着，但拉上房間窗簾完全不透光。

工作人員的服務是該酒店的亮點了 因為山裡複雜 店員會出來迎接 幫助提行李到房間（無電梯）下午茶派送到房間 房間內有免費的歡迎水果飲料啤酒，但和我付出的代價相比 總感覺差那麼一點點

下午2點到4點有下午茶，蛋糕🎂很好吃，冰涼中帶着甜甜的味道。
管家很貼心，提前到觀光車站點接待我們，幫忙拿行李，鼓浪嶼是步行島，島上除了觀光車可以通行，衹許步行，所以有管家幫拿行李真的是很感動。
超級推薦他們家哦，房間內提供免費飲品還有水果，放在冰箱內。
