msg:Location is not close any major public transportation. So it can be difficult to reach unless you plan to use taxi. But on the upside, it's located in a quiet residential neighborhood. So. It's perfect if you're looking for a staycation or rest.

The hotel is very new, modern and well-decorated. Rooms are exactly as shown in the pictures. We found buffet dinner and breakfast are decent, great in quality especially the seafood but not mind-blowing.

Overall, extremely happy with our stay.

msg:I have stayed in many hotels in Shenzhen. After comprehensive comparison, I still think that the most enjoyable thing is to focus on "new". Le Méridien in Shenzhen is a very new hotel with a full sense of design, especially the public area on the 6th floor, which makes people feel comfortable at first sight. Our family checked in late, and the little sister at the front desk saw that we brought a baby and helped us upgrade the room type. The facilities in the room are also very complete, the body feeling of the shower, and the wrapping degree of the mattress, pillow and quilt are all very good. The breakfast on the second day is also what I look forward to most. I can't say too much about the variety, but the product is very good, and the taste is also very popular with my family. The freshly squeezed juice is especially well received. Overall, it is a good stay experience. If I have the opportunity in the future, I will come back for vacation again.

The hotel has a special children's swimming pool with clean water. The afternoon tea is delicious and the dishes are also exquisite. My favorite is the small garden on the 6th floor, where every plant and tree is unique.

We ordered supper and ate together at night, but found that there was no suitable seat. There was only a small stool next to the dining table. Although there was a sofa, the sofa and the bed were very close and the table could not be moved over. We could only use the laundry basket temporarily. There was a circle of metal under the table. We both bumped into it when we were eating. It was quite painful. Everything else was ok.

The takeaway we ordered at 13:06 was not delivered at 13:40. Finally, we called them through Ctrip and asked us to pick it up ourselves. We originally planned to go out at 14:00. We have to catch a flight today. We chose this hotel because it is close to the airport. I don't recommend you to stay here. It's really bad. My suitcase is 29 inches and very heavy. It can't be put in the trunk. The porter is just watching next to me. He doesn't want to help. The online taxi driver couldn't find the hotel location many times! ! ! ! ! In the end, their service is worse than that of a 3-star hotel. It's the worst I've ever seen. If possible, I just want to give it a zero! With such a service attitude, I hope everyone will choose carefully when booking and don't step on the pit.

The breakfast is rich in variety and fresh in ingredients. Whether you like Western or Chinese breakfast, this place can meet your needs.

I highly recommend this hotel to travelers who are looking for a high-quality accommodation experience. Whether you are traveling for business or leisure, this will be your ideal choice. Looking forward to staying again in the near future!

1. I called the switchboard and the front desk, but no one answered until the mechanical sound started ringing. I called three times, and then I called the mobile phone three times before I answered. The reason given was: shortage of manpower! ! ! If staff shortage is your hotel's problem, what does it have to do with your guests?
2. There are mosquitoes in the room. I told them that the mosquito coils purchased have not arrived, but the implication is that they are standing still! A five-star hotel is not as good as a hotel like Jiji, and then lies without thinking? It will open on February 1st. Are you telling me that the mosquito coil purchase has not arrived? There is no business to start, and if the procurement is not done, how can it be possible that the procurement is not done?
3. I complained and asked the front office manager to give me an explanation. He called me very late to show that he understood my feelings and was sorry. Then I asked him to contact me later, and there was no further news.
4. I checked in, and then the guest room came to check the room! ! ! The room is not ready, so what are you selling? ?

msg:The night before, I checked in with my three-year-old son and went to bed at around 12 o'clock. The next morning at 9 o'clock, the smoke alarm in the room rang for three minutes. On the one hand, it disturbed my rest, and on the other hand, it scared the child. I also thought there was a fire.
I first called the front desk, and no one answered after more than ten rings.
Then I called the concierge, and the staff said they were checking and didn't know the reason for the time being. They said they would call us back after finding the reason.
Out of caution, it took about 20 minutes to pack up and check out. No one called me back during this period.
When checking out, I repeated the situation just now. The front desk staff seemed to have no idea about it.
Regarding the fact that the front desk didn't answer the phone, they said that someone was on duty, but there were three phones or something (I couldn't understand it at all, which gave me a sense of quibbling) But anyway, the front desk didn't answer the phone, which was a problem, especially this kind of emergency.
Regarding the reason, they still said that they were checking and looking for the reason, and would reply to me as soon as possible. I asked, is there any emergency, they said no, but the reason was not found. They apologized to me several times.
As a five-star hotel, the overall emergency service was poorly handled. First, there was no timely comfort and calming measures for the guests who thought there was an emergency, and secondly, there was no compensation.
I was about to check out, what's the point of calling me to tell me the reason? It has seriously disturbed my rest and schedule.
At 2:30 pm, the hotel called me again to explain the reason: the dust from the engineering department on the 22nd floor triggered the smoke detector (I later thought about whether it was triggered by the whole hotel or only my room? Because I saw that no other guests had any questions at the scene. My room was 1605 at the time). I questioned the result of the handling, and the service staff said that they would hold the engineering department responsible. I said that this was your hotel's business, and I had left the hotel and it had nothing to do with me. Then he asked me when I would come again next time and gave me the executive lounge privileges. I said that I might not choose your hotel next time.

Summary: The service staff's emergency service ability and ability to think about problems and make solutions from the customer's perspective are very weak. The hotel's service awareness and training are also insufficient.

The holiday breakfast ended at 10:30 instead of 11:00. As soon as it reached 10:30, the meal was immediately collected, and it was very stressful to eat breakfast. There was no one to guide the breakfast, and the seat had to be found by yourself. Overall, I was satisfied

msg:住的最差的五星酒店，空調不製冷，到半夜還在維修，聯繫前台和客服中心長時間沒人接電話，直到轉攜程電話才聯繫到女服務員，報了幾次説10多分鐘能修好，後來送來個電扇吹風，問送的服務員説不知道情況，要去了解，結果和前台一樣沒任何回饋，一直等到晚上11:30再致電前台，男服務生説不知道還要記錄，我説明天直接索賠終於有值班經理回覆，換了個房間結果一樣，房間不製冷，因第二天還有事，沒精力再致電了，到了第二天找前台換鑰匙和詢問為何沒人接電話，最可笑的是服務員説可能電話線路有問題，互相推諉，找理由，不專業，沒有服務意識的酒店，巧合的是週末住了惠州小徑灣艾美，完全不在一個服務水準上，另外車庫到房間需要換三個電梯也非常不方便，這樣的酒店虛有其表，沒有內在走不了多遠！
