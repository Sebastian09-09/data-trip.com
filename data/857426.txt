msg:Avoid this place! Never go there again!
The hotel facilities are very old, very old, and the rooms are even older. Broken and old.
There is no normal washing machine and dryer. I was shocked when I entered the so-called laundry room. It was an old double-drum washing machine that I couldn't even use.
Is it too much for a hotel of this price to have a normal laundry room?
The waiters' service is very poor. They are indifferent and don't care about the hotel. Do they really not need to train their employees?
For a hotel of more than 600 yuan, there is only one set of shampoo and shower gel in a family room for 3 people. I asked for it to be delivered to the room, but it didn't arrive after a long wait. The waiter who delivered it had a very poor service attitude and said that it was very difficult for them to have two sets. What? Is a disposable item worth 1 yuan? ? ? ?
Also, I have never had such a bad buffet breakfast.
