msg:TLDR: Had really high expectations when I booked this 5 diamond hotel, however the stay experience fell short from the expectations.

The Good:
+ Was offered room upgrade to sea view room during checked in.
+ Interior and exterior design of the hotel is really sets a relaxing tone to the entire stay. 
+ It was a nice touch having Bellboys to help us with luggage and open doors whenever we arrive at the hotel lobby
+ Staffs and cleaners greeted us was also a nice touch 
+ Breakfast options are extensive (including fresh juice bar and daily special juice concoction)
+ Free hotel activities to do daily 
+ Gym is well maintained and a good number of machines 

The Bad
- (Presales) Didn’t appreciate the fact that the booking page didn’t state the hotel deposit amount (which is slightly more than 1 time the hotel room price) and was only mentioned during check-in. Prior the trip, I tried to ask about whether there’s any hotel deposit via Trip.com message to hotel function and there’s no reply at all. (I mean a 3 diamond star hotel I stayed previous replied… but a 5 diamond star hotel didn’t).
- (Not controllable) Sadly, there’s construction going on and can see cranes and construction machinery hindering the view of the sea, as well as the noises.
- There’s supposedly a butler assigned to each guest, but my butler only added me on WeChat several hours after checkin. Also, was asking the butler about one of the afternoon hotel was still going on as we reached the venue and there’s no one around. He said he will check and then no reply for 20mins before I messaged him to inform that we won’t be waiting anymore. Didn’t appreciate that there’s no follow up. 
- The shower control knob will suddenly fall off at certain angle which can be rather dangerous given that it has quite a weight to it. 
- The bathtub’s shower head keeps leaking when we turned the other tap on to fill the bathtub, and we had to put the shower head into the bathtub to prevent flooding. 

All in all, it fell short on expectations in terms of the service compared to the service my partner and I had experienced in a 3 diamond star hotel at a fraction of this hotel’s price. 

Nonetheless, it is really a gorgeous place to stay in. Tastefully decorated and smell really great. Most of the staffs are friendly.

The hotel is not on the beach which wasn't being told explicitly.

Trip.com charged me full amount as security bond not hotel fees, and only refund after a few days after checkout. I'm very unhappy about this. So be careful to read their conditions.

I think it’s wise when booking to select the breakfast option, which is in buffet style, for several reasons.

I really enjoyed my stay and I highly recommend.

Without exception, all employees of the hotel are courteous, open and happy to respond to individual wishes. In addition to the staff that make this hotel special, the rooms/restaurants/pools and other amenities are very appealing and never overcrowded. You can tell that a lot of effort has gone into this hotel from the initial design to the daily upkeep. 

The location of the hotel is good for people looking for relaxation. However, if needed, it is also only 10 min (by cab) to the nearest town.

The beach across from the hotel is a hidden gem: we went there 3 times and very few people were there compared to the more popular beach locations. Really good breakfast. Great pools (although one was closed when we were there) and the kids play areas is great.

One area to improve: there are a few areas on the hotel grounds that are hard to navigate with a stroller (or a wheelchair I would think) and I think the hotel can do better to be more inclusive in this respect).

And there was some group teams&events. noisy at evening, hotel has no enough staff, they didn't clean my room. when I asked to clean they said, too busy so just can change towels. I paid more than 2k per day and never expected this service. too busy so cannot help to carry our bags from room. I like 1hotel chain a lot due to their style but I'll never visit Sanya 1hotel again.

The only problem for me was the location. Its a bit far from the city. And the staff said the beach opposite the hotel isn't suitable for swimming and that we have to go to  other beaches to swim which wasn't close to the hotel.
Perfact location if you are looking for peace and tranquility though.

We stayed a total of 9 nights and we are so so happy to have chosen 1 Hotel Haitang Bay.
The hotel itself is just stunning, beautiful grounds , and the design and concept are amazing. Great pools , the unique sky pool is not to be missed. The food was great , especially the breakfast, we always found something new to try and never got bored, the quality of the ingredients is excellent and always fresh. 
The rooms are very comfy, especially the mattresses, we had a room with pool access , our daughter loved it.
What make this hotel exceptional is the WHOLE team everyone is so so nice , and welcoming.  They genuinely care about their guests. 
The GM of the hotel is always talking with the guests and make sure everyone is happy , he always played with our young daughter and offered to prepare special meal for her if needed. Peal the culinary Director was very attentive to our needs and super friendly. Connie, Anna and Emily for 1 Dining are angels, they are so kind and friendly, they always go beyond to help their guests. 
The whole team from the kids playground are amazing , they are very patient with the kids , and genuinely love playing with them. 
And finally we had the best housekeeper , 浦克琼 was so efficient and always knew what we needed, she anticipated our needs and took good care of us. Thank you so much.

We were so sad to leave the hotel , but will definitely come back when we are in sanya.
This hotel is incredible of all aspects !! The Whole team made our stay memorable!
Thank you so much

msg:One of the most beautiful hotel I ever stayed in China! 
The atmosphere in the resort was relaxing and calm. The design and the materials used in the structure are the most interesting things about it. 
The staff was super nice and helpful in every situation. 
The room was very clean and nice. 
The pools, you have plenty of choice, from the family ones to the bigger ones. 
The restaurants give you a lot of choices, from western to local chinese food. 
The surroundings are the only part we didn't like. The resort was in the middle of a huge site in construction, so the arrival and the view around wasn't very nice. 
But, neither 100 m and you can still reach the beach from the resort, haitang bay has many water activities you can do, such as surf. 
If you like surfing, you can go as well in the surf village 6 km south of the resort. You can take an e-bike along the road or call a taxi.

-Pool area is a bit strange- doesn't seem to be a flow between pools

Food at the hotel is wonderful and Pearl Woo (director of culinary) was super friendly and passionate about the food. The hotel smell was beautiful and the environment much better than other hotels in Sanya. I stayed at the Intercontinental Resort Sanya after this trip and was extremely disappointed that it didn’t live up to 1 hotel. My top hotel in SANYA 💚

We already want there before but this time I have to underline a big disadvantage: among all the pool, only one is open to families with kids that makes it too crowded and not pleasant while the other two are reserved for adults and 16 yo kids and older. Really unfair and this made our experience much worst that the previous one. I recommended this to all my friends in the past but I will not do it again in the future if they travel with kids. What a pity. Definitely one of the best hotel in Sanya with one of the worst facilities  management.

The sea view is C position, the room type is reasonable, the facilities are relatively new, the glass swimming pool and the surrounding scenery are fresh and beautiful, which makes people feel happy. The buffet breakfast is exquisite and rich, and it is served until 10:30, with ample time. The aunt who cleans the room is polite and efficient, and has high quality. There was a little episode in the first night during the good check-in experience. The duty manager, customer relations depar**ent, and engineering depar**ent all attached great importance to it. After several communications, they sent fruit plates, red wine, and upgraded to a suite. The service was attentive. The design style of the hotel gives people a sense of comfort, and emphasizes the concept of harmonious coexistence between man and nature everywhere, which coincides with the environmental protection spirit advocated by WWF. Every morning when you go out or come back in the evening, you can hear the melodious chirping of birds. If you come during a more pleasant temperature period, it would be a good experience to open the door and blow the sea breeze to catch up with the manuscript. Pet-friendly, it seems that I have heard the sound of a puppy whining and acting coquettishly from the door of a guest room. I turned on the TV and saw the familiar "Traveler" section. It was a coincidence. Overall, I would consider coming here again for a relaxing vacation. It has both cost-effectiveness and quality.

The housekeeper Anne was very considerate and helped arrange activities in the hotel. The hotel's philosophy is environmental protection and sustainability. It does not pursue superficial luxury. A large number of recycled materials are used for hand-made products. In fact, it is labor-intensive and costly. The details show the care. The values ​​and aesthetics are very much in my point. The overall atmosphere of the hotel is relaxed and not deliberate. It is very relaxing to be surrounded by plants everywhere, and the service is also kind and polite. The hotel has rich activities and supporting facilities. It will be very worry-free if you bring children. It is worth mentioning that the Green House Restaurant has its own farm ingredients, which are very delicious. A good restaurant will really double the hotel experience! The hotel introduction of the guest room is worth reading. It is a very aspiring brand. I hope it can be understood by more people.

msg:One of the top choice hotels for holiday in Sanya, it is the best value for money in Haitang Bay. The hotel is full of sustainable development concepts. The whole hotel can feel the concept of sustainable development and growth. There are a lot of boat wood and volcanic stones on the wall. The hollow design and irregular boat wood design are so beautiful. The hotel also provides fresh fruits and drinks every day, as well as Hainan's specialties, partridge check and old salt lemonade. The hotel's service staff are very enthusiastic. Special praise for Winni and Amber in the front office. They are in good spirits. Emma is very good. There are also many special activities launched by the hotel, which are suitable for everyone to participate. The layout and hygiene of the room are great. I highly recommend this hotel. It is very cost-effective! Breakfast is the best bread I have ever eaten. The ordinary croissants are eaten with butter. I am still remembering the taste. I am full of food. The hotel's various services are also in place. You can drink a little wine and eat something in the sky bar on the ninth floor at night. It is very comfortable. The hotel has a super large transparent swimming pool. It may be the environmental protection theme that blesses the favorability upupup. But what I regret most is that I can't stay for a few more days. I will definitely stay for a few more days next time! ! ! !

Morven, the guest relations, responded promptly, and responded promptly. Except for the fact that there were not many types of breakfast, everything else was quite good, especially the various types of noodles. Except for beef tendon balls, I didn't even see lean meat slices, but there were quite a lot of juices, breads, and fruits and vegetables. The breakfast seemed to be varied, but there were not many choices for Chinese stomachs. The price of 268 per person was a bit high. If you want to eat breakfast, you can have it when booking. The Green House restaurant is delicious, and the afternoon tea bar is also very exquisite. Overall, it is 7-8 points. It is very suitable to stay in the off-season. I will come again next time and hope to improve the choice of breakfast.

The hotel is fragrant everywhere, and the wooden aroma is very pleasant. The hotel is divided into indoor and outdoor areas. The outdoor area is very large. The original wooden style architecture is combined with the natural stone texture. It is pure and fashionable. The original ecological scenery of the island is used as the design inspiration.

About the beach and swimming pool
We are on our honeymoon, and the hotel environment is quite in line with our needs. The hotel is across a road from the beach. You can ask the hotel to take an electric car to the beach. The electric car will take you to the back door, and the sea is across the road.
ps: The sea tonight is very beautiful! I also saw the sunset~ So happy
The swimming pool only opened the sky pool, and there are relatively few children's facilities. There are relatively few children in this hotel, but it may also be because of the off-season. Families with children may want to consider it.
The trip to Haitang Bay is relatively short. We will leave tomorrow. There are still many places in the hotel that we have not explored, and we have not signed up for adult activities. We will continue to explore when we have the opportunity~

msg:Sanya is dotted with major brand-name high-end hotel chains, but almost all of them have not been renovated for more than ten years. I never like to stay in hotels that are too old. Haitang Bay Sunshine One was our decision to choose again and again. The housekeeper Rose added WeChat to me a day in advance to facilitate communication. After arriving on the first day, the room was upgraded to a full sea view. The view was excellent. I immediately placed an order and extended my stay for two nights. , the entire trip to Sanya was spent at Sunshine One😄.
The room is clean and tidy, with sufficient floor height, spacious and comfortable, the bed and pillows are very comfortable, the floor-to-ceiling balcony door is well sealed and soundproofed, open the door, embrace the open view of the swimming pool and sea view, facing the sea due east, if you can get up and cloud The amount is small, and you should be able to see a great sunrise view over the sea. Unfortunately, it was cloudy in the mornings for the few days we stayed. Hainan is really comfortable in March. It’s not too sunny or too hot. It’s around 22-30 degrees every day.
When I took photos of the room, I did not turn on the bright mode lights. In fact, the light design is very scientific and user-friendly, and it is easy to use. The rest of the facilities in the room should be sufficient. From the housekeeper Rose, to the front desk Ms. Huang, Mr. Peng, and all the waiters are very good, smiling and patient. They provided us with many practical and effective suggestions about our trip to Sanya. Rose was worried about the mosquito problem when I went to the beach and Coconut Dream Promenade, so she thoughtfully sent me mosquito repellent. It was very effective and I was not attacked by mosquitoes even when I was wearing a skirt. We wanted to connect the computer to watch TV, and the engineer sent us a connecting cable that worked very well.
There is a free snack and drink in the room, you can get fruit downstairs, and there is plenty of free drinking water every day. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, so you are full every day, and you don't need to eat lunch. The swimming pool is also great, but unfortunately I can't swim, so I just went to play in the water.
There are few people on the nearby beach, and the beach and sea water are very beautiful. It is suitable for taking pictures easily. The hotel attendant can use a battery cart to deliver it to the back door of our hotel. We can just cross the road and get there. There are no bustling crowds. The beach is almost occupied, so you can be free and casual. shoot.
The travel photography provided with the hotel room rate (within the hotel) is also good. I am responsible for my own makeup and selected a few more photos in addition to the five free photos. Adding in the price of photo editing, it is quite reasonable in general. If you do it yourself I know how to edit pictures, and the price is more suitable, but my skills are limited, haha, I just made up a nine-square grid, posted it on Moments, and received a lot of likes.
The public area of ​​the hotel is comfortable, quiet, clean and tidy. I took photos indoors and outdoors for more than 40 minutes without being bitten by mosquitoes, which is really great for me (I am extremely attracted to mosquitoes).
The hotel has ample parking spaces and is not far from CDF Duty Free City Phase 1 and 2, Atlantis Water World, and Haichang Evernight City, just a short drive away.
Thank you very much for the care of housekeeper Rose. I had a pleasant trip to Sanya. I will recommend the hotel to friends who want to come to Sanya. If I come to Sanya again for vacation, I will also choose Sunshine One.

Environment: There are many plants in the hotel, and there is a nice smell, which is very relaxing. The privacy is very good. It takes only ten minutes to walk to the beach. The sand is very clean, but it is a pity that the wind and waves are too big to go into the sea.
Swimming pool: One side is acrylic transparent, and the other side is brick and stone opaque. When I went there, it was off-season and there were not many people. It was not deep, and the water was quite clean. Because it was open-air, there would be one or two mosquitoes occasionally.
Surroundings: To be honest, except for being close to the beach, there is really nothing around, there are no convenience stores, and eating basically depends on takeout or going to the street of Linwang Night Market.

The butler is called Billy, who helped answer various questions and book various activities for me from the day before check-in. During the stay, he helped to deliver many things and answered all my questions. The service was really considerate. Before, the Ritz-Raffles stayed at more than 2,000 a night, and there was no butler service. The service of Sunshine① really surprised me. The hotel breakfast is good, I like it very much, especially the freshly squeezed juice and yogurt, and the almond croissant is very delicious, but my husband doesn't like it, he has a Chinese stomach. The hotel's Internet celebrity swimming pool is beautiful, I went to swim for two days, it's beautiful? The hotel sky bar is also very good. We went to experience it once, but there was almost no one. It's a pity that the scenery is so beautiful, and the cocktail tastes good. Thanks to Brother Billy for taking care of it these two days.

The Sunshine One Hotel, which I chose blindly, greatly exceeded my expectations. The hotel was newly opened in recent years. The design is modern and simple, with environmental protection as the theme, and the creativity is novel, which fits the theme of harmonious coexistence between people and nature in Sanya. I came during the May Day holiday. There were more young people and relatively few people traveling with children. On the contrary, I liked this kind of quietness. I almost booked the swimming pool at night. The international chain parent-child hotel I went to later was for children to travel with children. Children like it, but I still like new hotels. During the period, I tasted the lawn barbecue in the evening, which tasted quite good, and I was also given a cocktail from the rooftop bar, which was nice! I especially want to thank the private butler Rose for helping me upgrade to a sea view room, facing the sea, and really opening my eyes to see the sea. During the period, I also served patiently. Before leaving, I also gave the children the hotel mascot, a lamb doll Yiyi. I will choose here next time I travel!

I chose a panoramic king-size bed room, facing the sea and admiring the sea. Although the weather was not so good these days, it was really great to get up from the bed and see the sea and then the sunrise. The hotel's breakfast also changes every morning. I don't know why some people say it's so bad. I called and said I wanted a swimming ring, and it was delivered in about 5 minutes. It was also very good to get out of the car, open the car door and take the luggage. The only problem is that in the first few days of staying, I still think the hotel's wood fragrance is quite nice, with the feeling of sandalwood and agarwood, but later I felt that the smoke was a bit on my head.

msg:I booked Sunshine One on the recommendation of a friend. I landed at 3am on Day 1. The first person to greet me was the hotel security staff. After the driver put down my luggage, the security guard pointed me in the direction of the front desk and looked at me coldly as I took so many luggage to check in. To be honest, the experience was not very good. Later, there were some small episodes when I went to the room. The duty manager Xiao Jiang and Manager Wang also went to help me deal with it later.
The real feeling of staying in the room for so many days is that the room is very comfortable and the space is also large. The breakfast is not bad. There are freshly squeezed juices. Bread is recommended. There are 2 chocolate flavors that are quite delicious. The variety is also complete. Maybe I went there late. Some breakfasts, such as fried dumplings, are very old.
This hotel is especially suitable for vacation and recuperation. It is also very quiet. Friends who are afraid of noise can come here. Friends who want to take pictures can come here for travel shooting. The hotel is still quite good.
The room lady will also help me fold my clothes and store my cosmetics. The service is quite good. The waiters on each floor will also take the initiative to greet me on the floor.

The hotel is in Haitang Bay, a little far away, but the hotel facilities are complete and there are many activities. Anne helped us sign up for lawn archery, which was a super pleasant experience! I like the carrot juice for breakfast very much. Two cups of it are not enough! It's not far from the beach. The hotel has a shuttle bus, which is a great choice for watching the sunrise!

The hotel design is full of surprises. It is best to bring a friend who can take pictures. The service staff is well trained. Everyone is warm and polite, especially Rose, who coordinated the entire hotel itinerary, making the people who stay in the hotel very comfortable.

The hotel focuses on the concept of environmental protection, and is filled with a faint woody fragrance everywhere

Breakfast: very delicious, rich in variety, and the taste is very online. I love Hainan pickled noodles the most!

The wooden aromatherapy in the room and the environmentally friendly packaging of toiletries were all very good. The sanitation was very clean, and the service staff would take the initiative to greet us when they met.
Facilities: Complete facilities, makeup mirrors, wooden blocks, two large 360-degree rotating mirrors on two washbasins are very convenient
Sanitation: The sanitation was cleaned very thoroughly. After breakfast, I came back and encountered the room cleaning. The cleaning lady cleaned quickly and thoroughly, and took the initiative to bow and greet. No dead corner problems were found.
Environment: Actively upgrade to a full sea view room for free. Each room has a terrace and the room is very high. Breakfast is really a treasure. For a bread-head like me, the dozen or so kinds of freshly made bread are really delicious~ We caught up with the infinity pool and experienced it in the last ten minutes before it closed. The lifeguards were very enthusiastic, the water quality was good, and the experience was very good
Service: The housekeeper Anna provided very good service. She took the initiative to introduce various places in detail when checking in at 10 o'clock in the evening, explained the relevant matters, and responded to inquiries actively and quickly. The restaurant staff are also very active and dedicated. By the way, the bathroom in the hotel lobby is very clean, and the hand dryers are all Dyson. The pick-up service outside the lobby is very good, and the guy actively looks for parking spaces to pick up the suitcases. This price is sunny, go for it!

Fresh vegetables and a variety of bakeries are available, and the noodles and vegetable juice are truly unforgettable.

From the time I arrived at the hotel, I checked in, the housekeeper I met in my room, the lifeguard at the swimming pool, and the restaurant, all the staff I encountered at the hotel were very considerate and friendly.
Every moment from checking out to getting in the car was touching, and I would like to thank the staff at Hotel 1 for giving me great memories by leaving a review.

I would like to recommend it to my friends, and I definitely want to come back.
I hope that my review will help many people choose this hotel.

msg:Overall evaluation:
The hotel's hardware and style are relatively young, and it is a relatively rare category in the Sanya hotel series, with a B&B style. The whole hotel is filled with a woody fragrance, and the breakfast is also good.

Hotel environment:

The hotel environment is very good, and the whole hotel is filled with a woody fragrance, which makes people feel very comfortable. The room is also very clean and tidy, with complete facilities, and the bed is very comfortable, which makes people feel very relaxed. The location is across the road and a green area overlooking the sea view. It would be better if the floor is higher.

Service experience:

None of the value-added experience projects can be booked, a paddle board, a singing bowl, the rule is one day in advance, which is considered very early within the stipulated time, and the others will not be booked again. The reception of the concierge depar**ent is good, but the check-in at the front desk is so-so. There is no staff guidance, no one introduces the room facilities, and there is no sign of the mini bar charge, which will be assumed to be free. But later, the butler's WeChat communication language was particularly unpleasant, including calling the guest room at 12:30 in the middle of the night, which is unacceptable. The duty manager came to explain the communication attitude the next day.

Dining experience:

The hotel's breakfast is very rich, with many choices and tastes very good. The hotel's restaurant environment is also very good and the service is very thoughtful.

Others:

In general, the hardware facilities are good, and I hope the service and communication methods with guests will be improved.

msg:A very satisfying living experience: the hotel design is very beautiful, the light sandalwood fragrance in the hotel is very nice, the housekeeper kitty's service is very considerate, five-star praise, I will stay here again next time I come to Sanya!

Advantages:
1. The scenery of the hotel is super beautiful, the hotel's garden design and infinity pool are very beautiful, very photogenic.
2. You can see the hotel's garden design + infinity pool + 180° full sea view on the balcony, and you can see the sunrise over the sea while lying on the bed. This feeling is simply too great.
3. The hotel is newly renovated, and everything in the hotel is new; the design of the hotel is also very novel, whether in the room, lobby or even in the elevator, every corner of the hotel is full of design, which makes people shine and wins my heart;
4. I originally booked a side sea view room, and Kitty upgraded me to a full sea view room, which was a surprise, thank you;
5. Kitty gave me a VIP fruit plate as soon as I checked in. The fruit was delicious and the service was very considerate;
6. The hotel's infinity pool is very beautiful and the photos are very good; I went there twice and the experience was very good; beach chairs, bath towels, tea, etc. are all provided free of charge;
7. The travel photographer given by the hotel is very nice and will try his best to meet our shooting needs. The hard-working cameraman took a lot of photos for us in the hot weather;
8. The hotel's gym is small but complete, with new and complete fitness facilities, and a free yoga room;
9. There are free switches to play in the hotel's game room;
10. The hotel's service staff are very polite and will say hello when they meet.

Disadvantages:
1. It is a little far from the hotel to the beach. You have to go through a small forest and the road is winding. It is not as convenient as the hotels next door, which have roads leading directly to the beach;
2. The pedestrian door out of the hotel is still under construction, so it is not very convenient to walk out;
3. The quilt and sheets are a little damp. I don’t know if it is a common problem of seaside hotels; the pillow is soft, and people who are used to sleeping on hard pillows may not be used to it;
4. Takeout is not delivered to the room, you need to go to the takeout cabinet in the lobby to pick it up;
5. It would be better if there were electric curtains.

msg:I was a little worried before going there. It was remote and not close to the sea. Is the concept of environmental protection equal to simplicity?
After arriving at the hotel, I felt it was just so-so at first. The lobby was not as grand as the Marriott I stayed in before. The room was mainly designed with logs and had no special features, although I upgraded to a front sea view room. But after walking around the hotel and staying in the room for a little longer, I felt more and more comfortable.
There was a faint fragrance everywhere, which smelled very comfortable. The hotel is worthy of being mainly designed with environmental protection. There are small surprises everywhere, and you can look at it slowly for a long time. The room is well soundproofed, the bedding is comfortable, and it is very quiet to sleep.
There are many types of breakfast, and the varieties are changed every day. The freshly squeezed carrot juice really surprised me. The waiter took the initiative to say hello and was very friendly and enthusiastic.
This hotel is the kind that you will like more and more the longer you stay. It is definitely not the kind of popular one.
Of course, there are also areas that need improvement. The food in the set meal that requires driving to Yi Xiaochu is OK, but it is really inconvenient. Although there is a car to send it there, the time is fixed and you have to leave the hotel, which is not free. If you change to dining in the hotel, you will feel much better without leaving the hotel.
It is recommended that Yi Xiaochu can give hotel guests a special discount coupon in the future. It is better to have meals in the hotel if the package includes meals.

msg:A hotel focusing on environmental protection concepts
At first I thought it would be like many hotels with a concept.
But every day I stayed there, I quietly discovered that this hotel is really doing environmental protection attentively.
First of all, in terms of hotel decoration details, it ranges from the selection of building materials, the use of a lot of recycled wood and volcanic stone, to the use of natural plants to decorate the exterior walls, and even the slippers and clothes hangers in the room are recyclable materials.
Moreover, the hotel also has its own system for saving water and energy. When I visited the hotel, I also found that there were many abandoned large tree trunks on some grasslands, which were like art installations and seemed to tell their own annual ring stories.
I remember seeing a very profound sentence in the promotional video in the elevator: "We do not ask for, but respectfully pick up nature's gifts."
So you saw the design of the birch branches crossing the roof in the lobby
I saw various decorative walls made of discarded wooden *****s in the elevator hall.

In addition, the most popular thing about the hotel is probably the fully transparent infinity swimming pool.
The afternoon sun shines through the water onto the ground floor, creating sparkling light and shadow.
There is a sunny coconut grove next to it~it’s really beautiful
Of course, a perfect hotel must be special! God knows how many pictures I took
In addition, the breakfast in the hotel is also excellent.
Sanya specialty noodles that are different every day are really fun to eat
And the fruits and vegetables are all delivered from our own farm.
If you are a bread person, you will also love their various handmade breads and my favorite Banlan sauce.
In the end, what made me completely fall in love with this hotel was the service.
I have always felt that both design and style are good
Everyone has different preferences
But in the end, the most memorable thing is the attentive service.
I wasn’t too reassured when the hotel had a butler and provided contact information before check-in (many hotels now also provide butler-style service)
But every day after that, the housekeeper would ask how you were resting and how your stay was.
And the hotel also has many public activities every day
We will also introduce and help make reservations
Then one day I said that I didn’t sleep well the night before
She immediately brought me sleeping spray
It really warmed me up
So I really want to thank my housekeeper Kitty
Makes me feel at home in the hotel
Moreover, even the lady in the housekeeping department who cleans the house every day is very friendly and greets her with a smile every day.
Although the hotel is not so famous or famous among the many luxury hotels in Haitang Bay,
But it's like the woody scent in the hotel
It's niche but really refreshing and worth recalling.

Since I stayed in Sunshine One, I always stay there every time I go to Sanya. The familiar comfort is still beautiful and the impeccable scenery. I like the big swimming pool and sunshine everywhere. A unique fragrance and a rich breakfast that changes hot meals every day. Especially the considerate and enthusiastic EMMA. Every time, she will contact me in advance and always ask about my needs during the stay. Some hotels will not stay again because the facilities and scenery do not meet the five-star standards. Regardless of whether the house service can't keep up with Sunshine One, it meets all the conditions that make people choose it every time. I rarely write reviews, but I will write one every time I stay here.

msg:The hotel is very interestingly designed, with many small places to explore. The overall style is like Thailand. The experience is very good. It is a hotel where you can stay for a day. The hotel also has a spa, swimming pool, parent-child activities, and the scenery is also very good. You can take pictures at will. You can also bring your pets. The cleaning fee is 500 per night, and you will be given a nest, toys, and water bowls. You can also go to the 9th floor sky bar to take pictures.
Special praise for the service. Every time I go out, the room is tidied up, and the skin care products I put there are specially tidied up👍
The breakfast is pretty good, both Chinese and Western can be chosen. Croissants, Baoluo noodles, and yogurt are also good👍
The location is a bit far from the downtown area. There are not many street lights around at night. It is okay to drive by yourself

The glass swimming pool is a highlight and the breakfast is rich. Guests must try it. The sea view room we originally booked was upgraded to a suite at the hotel. It was very hygienic and the facilities were very user-friendly. The hotel staff were very enthusiastic, especially Kitty, the pretty girl at the front desk. She sent us to the room and added her WeChat account to ask for the original room the next day. Under her coordination, we still charge for the sea view. I really have to give it a thumbs up. All in all, it was a pleasant experience.

msg:Room facilities: The hotel is decorated in an environmentally friendly wooden style. As soon as you enter the hotel, you will smell the fragrance. It smells very good. I booked a double room. The room is large and comfortable. I slept well.

Room view: I can see the sea, hahaha, I am very satisfied.

Location and transportation: Located in Haitang Bay, very close to Wuzhizhou Island, it is very convenient to go to the duty-free shop Haichang Evernight City. You can take a taxi or drive yourself. There will inevitably be traffic jams during holidays, so it’s best to go out early.

Swimming pool: Very good, with a depth of 1.2m and a constant temperature. However, the weather was a bit cloudy the past few days and the wind would make it a bit cold, but it was okay if you were wrapped in a towel when you came out. The transparent swimming pool is indeed very suitable for check-in, haha, and there is also a mermaid activity, but due to schedule conflicts, I didn’t try it out and will try it next time.

Service: Feel at home! Every service staff is very kind. I am very grateful to my housekeeper Jenny. From check-in to final departure, she was very considerate throughout the process. The activities she helped to book were also super interesting, such as making coffee grounds pendants and creative flow yoga. You can just lie down while staying in the hotel. Not lonely.

Calling Jenny again! ! Next time I go to Sanya, I’ll stay at Sunshine One~

Cleanliness: Auntie came to clean it every day. We stayed for two days and the room was clean. The bathtub felt great, which was very relaxing.

Travel Photography: The hotel provides travel photography. There are a lot of photos taken at No. 1 Hotel. Make an appoin**ent early. The photoshooting effect is very good. I ordered a lot of photos and there are packages. The effect of travel photography is very good👍🏻

Thank you again for the hospitality at No. 1 Hotel. See you ANNE again in the future!

Let me talk about the room first. I like the decoration style very much. The wood tone is very high-end and comfortable. It is fully equipped and designed to be practical and convenient.
Moreover, this hotel is the safest and cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in in Sanya. The cleaning lady is very enthusiastic, attentive and responsive.

The hotel environment is also beautiful. Emma also reminded us to enjoy breakfast. The breakfast was rich and delicious! So full~
It was really comfortable to stay here for these two days! The swimming pool in the room we stayed in was not at a constant temperature. It was a bit cold to go swimming in this weather, which was a pity hh
The hotel also has an infinity swimming pool, which is very comfortable to swim in. There is also full protection by security guards.

The overall quality of the hotel is really high, and you can also enjoy afternoon tea
The most outstanding thing about the hotel is the environmental theme. The room card is also made of wood, which is very interesting and unique. This is the first time I have seen it~

From arriving at the lobby to entering the room, there are environmentally friendly and recyclable details everywhere. It is a place where staying can make people calm down. , I originally had no idea about the concept of environmental protection, but walking in the woods of the hotel, the feeling of being full of oxygen is really refreshing!

The butler Steven is really responsible and conscientious. He also responds to messages sent at 11 o'clock at night instantly. He is always available for any needs.

By the way, the breakfast is very rich. It would be a loss to stay here without bringing breakfast! ! ! ! ! !

msg:This is a hotel that I have been dreaming of staying at for three years. The reason is simple it is a LEED certified building! The hotel building itself is closely related to the quality of indoor life for its guests! If the most luxurious architectural design goes against nature, it must not be environmentally friendly and healthy enough! As soon as I stepped into this hotel, I knew that it exceeded my expectations in every aspect! If we talk about the architectural design of a hotel in Sanya, only the Park Hyatt can compare with it. If we talk about the quality of photography, it can only be said that it beats the two internet celebrity five-star hotels I specially selected this time! The most noteworthy thing is the service of this hotel. The warm and polite staff, butler service and turndown service can perfectly compete with the Ritz-Carlton! What impressed me the most during my stay was the gentle-spoken male supervisor at the front desk who proactively asked about my needs during check-in and check-out. In my mind, when a hotel achieves the highest luxury standards, it must compete with its people. ! This is probably what the luxurious building, the ultimate service, the wildly growing vegetation, and the outstanding people are all about!

The breakfast room is very rich. The dishes in the noodle shop and Chinese restaurant are carefully cooked and delicious, and the prices are five-star standards.
The house price is very cost-effective and the accommodation is quite elegant.
The beach is also very close. There is a trail next to the swimming pool and across the road is Haitang Bay Beach.

msg:Make a fair evaluation.
First of all, the overall hotel is quite good, with a score of 4.7 or above.
1. The hotel housekeeper (customer relations) definitely scored 5 points, which directly raised the overall rating. Our hotel housekeeper is Jenny.
2. Meals, the cakes, breads, and desserts for breakfast are great, and you can smell the aroma when you walk next to them. However, other types of breakfast are average. There are five or six kinds of stir-fried dishes and very few barbecues. The room includes an executive lounge. Although the type and scale are small compared to other hotels, it is still exquisite and has unlimited supply.
3. The room is generally quite satisfactory, and environmentally friendly materials are meaningless to people who don’t catch colds. Hygiene, cleaning and other aspects are very good. We were also given a fruit plate with chocolates.
4. Swimming pool. This large suspended constant-temperature swimming pool is definitely a plus. You can swim during breakfast and lunch in winter. It is very big and comfortable. We were here on New Year's Eve and Spring Festival, and we were worried that the weather would be cold and we wouldn't be able to play in the water. My son wanted to play in the water, so we checked out many hotels and chose this one with a heated swimming pool.
5. I give a big thumbs up to the hotel’s butler service. Jenny added me a day in advance, asked what I needed, helped us book activities in advance, and reminded us of the arrangements for New Year activities during our stay. The butler service of several hotels I have stayed in so far is completely incomparable to this.
6. It is not convenient for the hotel to go to the beach in Haitang Bay. Although the hotel has a battery car to take it to the roadside, there is a long and rotten wooden plank road to the beach from the roadside. The sand is relatively co****, so it is very inconvenient to play without washing your feet.

facility:
I like the acrylic heated swimming pool very much. The temperature is stable and just right. The lifeguard also helped me get the spare bath towels placed by the pool. Wear a swimsuit and bathrobe and go swimming directly from the room, and then go back after swimming. I especially like to go when it's slightly dark and the lights are nice.

The lobby is also very fragrant and there seems to be a small children's playground.


Cleanliness: Cleaning is also very timely. It is an environmentally friendly hotel. Dental equipment and other items are not actively replaced, but you can contact the front desk to replace them.


Environment: The lobby is on the 3rd floor. The other side of the 3rd floor faces the sea. There is a lobby bar with a good view. The sky bar on the 9th floor is also good, with a good view. The key point is that there are few children, there are not so many people and noisy people, and it is relatively quiet.

Service: 5-star review. I like Kitty’s thoughtfulness very much. She is very kind, nice, polite, and responds in a timely manner. I had a great few days.

Disadvantages: A little far from the sea, no private beach. But I think this is really okay, just cross the street. It's really OK to sit at the terrace bar on the third floor and look at the sea across the road.

The breakfast is really good, and it may not be comparable to the Edison. Of course, the hotel prices are also different, but it is not noisy, there are not too many people, and the service is good.

I will stay again next time I come~

msg:First of all, the service is very good. Because I brought my child with me, I contacted the hotel in advance to note the special requirements. The beautiful girl with small bracelets enthusiastically fulfilled them one by one. She always asked whether she could provide them before arriving at the hotel or after checking in. What kind of help did it give me, and I got a service experience that exceeded my expectations. I think with such employees, this hotel will definitely get better and better in the future. Such a responsible person should really be promoted and raised hahaha
Secondly, this hotel is very new, the decoration is very innovative, environmentally friendly and full of creativity.
The location is also great. Almost all rooms can see the sea, and the view is wide. If you want to go to the beach, you can just walk across the road. The beach is clean, but the waves are too strong and there is no development, so it is not suitable for going to the sea.
In short, since this was a family trip, I did a lot of homework. I had booked other hotels before staying in this hotel, but the customer service staff in other hotels were so poor that I couldn't accept it, so I decisively chose this one with a high rating. , to be honest, it is really worth the rating. I can only say thank you to all the service staff. I will choose Sunshine One Hotel again next time I come and book with the beautiful girl with small bracelets. Hahaha

msg:Rose from the guest relations depar**ent had already contacted me before I checked into the hotel. It was my first time to check in and I didn’t know what the hotel was like. I felt a little uneasy after reading some reviews, so I ordered a garden-view king bed! As soon as I arrived at the hotel's exterior, I felt like I was in a game world and on vacation. There is a bit of industrial style that I think is very unique! A game like that (Dying Light) feels so good!

As soon as I arrived at the front desk, I was upgraded to a selected sea view room, which was a bit unexpected! The hotel a**osphere is very good! When the room is opened, the wind is very strong and very comfortable! It made me really lie down in the hotel and not want to move! The selected ocean view bed also has a bathtub behind it. Rose gave me a disposable bath bag, which was so thoughtful!

The hotel's swimming pool is also an Internet celebrity swimming pool. Half of the pool is real and half of the pool is fully transparent and very beautiful! Quite fun

Finally, let me tell you my favorite! The room is very windy and faces the sea! I didn't even close the balcony door all night long. The wind was so comfortable! It’s so beautiful to see the sunrise!

msg:The design of the hotel is quite stylish, and the woody fragrance and environmentally friendly concept are also quite attractive. The water temperature of the constant-temperature swimming pool is a little warm and cold, which makes it feel like a vacation from a distance. My friends and I participated in the activity of making pendants from coffee grounds, and the teachers were very patient. Unfortunately, the sound therapy sessions are fully booked and the number of places is a bit limited.

It is more suitable to stay in a hotel in Haitang Bay, as the surrounding area is a bit too deserted. The hotel does not have a private beach. You can go to the beach through the back door, but that area seems to be under construction. The outdoor environment inside is not bad and suitable for walking. My suggestion is that some large vacant public areas on the guest room floors can be used to place some sofa seats. Leaving them empty would be a waste of view and space.

Because it was my birthday, the room was decorated and a small cake was given. The overall service was quite good. The housekeeper Rose was very dedicated, thank you very much, and overall it was a satisfactory experience.

Our butler Rose was also very considerate. Because the check-in time was postponed, she gave us mini bar drinks and snacks.

It’s so delicious, sisters! The hotel is located in the beautiful #Haitang Bay, adjacent to #Sanya International Duty Free Shop, #Atlantis Water World and #Wuzhizhou Island. The transportation is very convenient. The hotel has a white birch forest lobby. These white birch trees are in the Daxinganling Mountains. Recycled natural fallen birch tree punch. Other decorations in the hotel also make full use of local recyclable materials, such as volcanic stone, railway sleepers, abandoned ship wood, etc., which fully implements the concept of sustainable development. Various details in the guest room inspire everyone to think about sustainable development, such as wooden room cards, paper hangers that indicate the source of materials, and bathroom sandglass timers that remind you to save water. Full marks for creativity! The fruits and vegetables at the fruit station in the lobby and in the restaurant are self-selected. Most of the ingredients come from the hotel’s own Sunshine Clothes Farm. They are fresh and healthy. For people like Liwo Mei who love to eat fruits and vegetables, they will feel happy. The design is unique, supplemented by renewable materials and local green plants, bringing green indoors: wooden key cards, paper hangers, recyclable wooden note pads, and water glasses specially made from recycled wine bottles. In addition to the constant-temperature swimming pool, there is also a large suspended transparent swimming pool that is worthy of checking in. It gives people an immersive experience of swimming in the sky. Finally, I would like to commend the Guest Relations Manager Allen. Just hearing his voice will make people feel considerate and very polite. , I will definitely come back to One Hotel again when I come to Sanya in the future! !

To sum it up in a sentence from my girlfriend: In other hotels, I would be reluctant to use the towels and bath towels inside for fear of being unhygienic, but here I actually don’t mind using them.
It's quite amazing, maybe it's the hotel's style design and the attitude of the staff that give people a sense of trust.

It is the small but beautiful hotel I want, warm and tasteful. Friends who are not obsessed with having a hotel beach🏖️ can feel free to go!
However, there are still times when service needs to be strengthened. For example, I need a waiter to help take a photo. The guy wearing glasses said that I am busy right now and cannot help you take a photo, but he was at the check-out area. Standing there stupidly, the service awareness is relatively primitive.

Although the hotel breakfast does not have many varieties, it tastes very good. My favorite is the freshly squeezed fruit and vegetable juice, which can be mixed according to the daily fruits and vegetables. The Hainanese rice noodles with your own choice of ingredients are also highly recommended~
The hotel is not far from Houhai Village. It takes about 15 minutes by car. If you like surfing, it is also very convenient to get there from the hotel.

msg:Very satisfied with the living experience. This is the second time I have stayed at Sunshine 1. The last time was in December 2020. This time my family traveled to Sanya and specifically wanted to stay here. The environment is clean and quiet, the facilities are complete, the breakfast buffet is delicious, and the service is great. They are warm and considerate, especially Miss Rose, who arranged the itinerary in advance and specially prepared bed bumpers, small stools and children's activity reservations for the children. She is very enthusiastic and has a very friendly attitude. I will stay here every time I come, highly recommended.
Little Seedlings Children’s Activities: Very Good

msg:My birthday is November 26th. After getting the upgraded room 1026, I felt that the hotel was very considerate. If they had an 11th floor, they would probably give me room 1126. Let’s talk about our feelings:
1. The room is very good and the bathtub is very comfortable. The design of many places reveals the concept of environmental protection without sacrificing the comfort of the guests. This is good.
2. Although the hotel is not on the beach, the several swimming pools are quite unique.
3. The service provided by the hotel staff is very good, very kind and proactive, especially Kitty, the guest relations person at Sunshine One Hotel, is also very good.
4. Is there any bad experience? There are probably some, such as travel photography. It took half an hour to take pictures. It turned out to be just a gimmick. I took a lot of pictures, but there were only 6 pictures for free, and the ones I showed you were repaired pictures. If you don’t pay, I would give them to you. 6 pictures are the original pictures. Hahaha, if you think it’s good, you have to add money to buy it. Of course, this is a matter of opinion, just feel free to like it, but in my opinion some of the food looks too ugly.


The faults are always there, I really like this hotel.

The hotel contacted me one day in advance. Thank you, Miss Jesse, for being very attentive and patient~ Because they knew we were coming for our honeymoon, they arranged the honeymoon decorations, sent fruits and small cakes, and it made it feel like a honeymoon ritual. The room they arranged for us was great, we could just lie on the bed and watch the sunrise! The hotel has rich breakfast and good internal facilities. It is very suitable for vacation. I will choose this hotel next time I have the chance!

The scenery at the beach is very beautiful. The hotel will send a car to take you to the beach. When you come back, you can also ask the hotel to send a car to pick you up. It is more suitable for young people to come together, or for the whole family to come together for an outing. It is particularly worth mentioning that we participated in an event at the spa this time. Healing activity, great! Recommended to everyone!

The theme of environmental protection and recycling is reflected everywhere in the hotel, and the design is also unique. The most important thing is to lie in bed and watch the sunrise, and then go back to sleep.

The main reason is that the service is so considerate. Highly recommend this housekeeper. No matter where the hotel is, there is a light woody smell, which is very pleasant and I personally think it is very nice. Besides, I like the room very much in terms of style and use of space. The room is large and very clean. Opening the curtains is a great viewing spot. The hotel is very cost-effective and the breakfast is rich. I won’t say any more, just rush and it’s over👍👍👍👍👍👍

What can I say? It’s super quiet and the environment is great.
Butler service attitude is super good
Like kitty with her real name, she is very gentle
The hotel swimming pool is great
As a person who is not very good at swimming, I want to wear a swimming ring and soak in the pool.
The hotel's breakfast is also good
Camping barbecue meal for two included in the package
The portion is too big for two people to eat. It tastes good too.
The only drawback is that the road to the beach is under construction
Looking forward to staying again next time. It can be better~

msg:The only Sunshine One hotel in Asia, the hotel staff are warm and courteous. The housekeeper Kitty called in advance and added WeChat to confirm the check-in time and needs. Not only did she upgrade the sea view room, but she also took the initiative to care and follow up every day during the stay, which made me unable to sleep well. I got a buckwheat pillow as a soft pillow, and it was like a little angel butler~ The hotel’s restaurant, front desk, and concierge staff are also very attentive. They not only greet you proactively, but also chat with you about local life in Sanya, and are also very knowledgeable about the characteristics of their own hotel. I am very proud that I have mastered the corporate culture! In terms of environment, I was very surprised, because the moment I opened the car door, I was greeted by the scent of cedar. From the reception to the lobby to the elevators, corridors, and guest rooms, it was this refreshing smell. The room is fully air-conditioned when the door is opened, but the bath towel is always warm when you swim ashore. Service, that's how it should be! The hotel is actually very big. The south wing and north wing each have their own highlights and are both outstanding. The skyline swimming pool is the signature, and guests at other swimming pools can use it. Play equipment is also readily available, which is very convenient. You must choose breakfast when you stay here. It has both Chinese and Western styles. It focuses on the concept of health and environmental protection. It has a freshly squeezed juice station, as well as a small display table for tableside dishes. There are waiters in the dining room with limited snacks to greet guests and try them out. Service, There’s nothing to say about the taste or variety! The room is large in size, the layout concept is very novel, the design concept is very unique, the balcony has an unparalleled sea view, and Wuzhizhou Island is also close at hand! I hope that after the hotel's underground passage is renovated and the seaside trees are moved in March next year, there will be better and more beautiful sunshine! Next time I come to Sanya, I will come again!

msg:This is not a perfunctory five-star review, I write it sincerely😭
I booked Sunshine One and Yanlord Crown in Sanya. I didn’t have any expectations for Sunshine One (I had never heard of it before), but after staying here, I feel that I like Sunshine One more than the popular Yanlord Crown. It's niche, quiet, and cozy. It really feels like a vacation, and the price is not exorbitant.
Facilities: The children's paradise is warm and lovely, and there are many choices in the catering section, such as gym, sky bar, outdoor camping, children's swimming pool, family swimming pool, skyline swimming pool...there are really many choices...Although there is no private beach, there is only a few steps from the back door of the hotel to the nearest beach. It takes 5 minutes to walk and is very convenient.
Cleanliness: Cleaning is diligent, the room is comfortable and clean
Environment: There is a lot of greenery. Green plants can be seen everywhere on the roadside, walls, and rooftop bars. The air is fresh and pleasing to the eye.
Service: I sincerely thank Miss Rose from the hotel. She took the trouble to answer so many questions for us during our stay and provided many considerate and warm services... I originally booked two twin-bed pool rooms but there were children, so the lady did her best to help us adjust a double bed. , and thoughtful arrangements are made next to it, and the China Unicom door is also opened...He also helped carry luggage when leaving the hotel, which is really nice...Both the elderly and children praised the hotel service. I will definitely stay here next time I come to Sanya. Thank you again

The facilities are very new, the whole thing is in Muji style, environmentally friendly, and natural to get along with people.

When we first checked in, someone took our luggage directly to the hotel room. Buckwheat pillows and turndown service are also provided. There is a feeling of being at home.

The hotel itself is not very famous in Sanya, so we came here with some trepidation. As soon as we entered the lobby, the scent of oak and lavender instantly made us feel relaxed and happy. The lobby is equipped with self-service fruits and drinks, with unlimited drinks.
When we returned to the room, we opened the balcony door to the swimming pool. We arrived by plane at midnight. The children wanted to jump into the sparkling swimming pool in the middle of the night, but I stopped them in time. After breakfast the next day, we couldn’t wait to jump in and swim. Playful, this weekend was great!
In particular, I would like to give Emma a thumbs up. Add me on WeChat one day in advance. She will always respond to your requests. Next time you book a room, please contact her directly!

Although the check-in day was earlier than the check-in time, the room was ready early, which was a great surprise.
The hotel is the only 1 hotel in the Asia-Pacific region and is full of design. The lobby fruit station offers Sanya's characteristic partridge tea and passion fruit tea, as well as local seasonal fruits, including plums, plantains and oranges. The aromatherapy in the lobby and elevators is green and woody, much like Diptyque's figs. .
The hotel decoration is also mainly natural and environmentally friendly. Green plants, natural wood furniture and decoration can be seen everywhere in the lobby and rooms.
Breakfast is also very nice. The bread and sandwiches are super delicious. There are also Hainanese special meals every day, including pickled noodles and raw porridge.
After staying for two days, the overall experience exceeded expectations. I will stay a few more days next time to have a good experience.

msg:Let’s talk about the good points first: the welcoming guys and girls at the door are very dedicated and will help you open the door, pick up your luggage and give directions when you come in and out; the security guard at the swimming pool is very polite and jokes with the guests, which is very comfortable; there are many kinds of breakfast and the taste is good. good

Let’s take a look at the shortcomings
First: There were no slippers when I checked into the hotel. I called the front desk. The front desk asked if they had cotton slippers or flip-flops. I said neither. After waiting for ten minutes, the cotton slippers were delivered. I asked where the flip-flops were. He said he would go back to get it, and waited for fifteen minutes, urging the front desk once before delivering it.
Second: The mirror next to the sink has a switch but it has no power and cannot be turned on.
Third: You need to watch the water when the bath is draining, otherwise the lower half of the switch will turn off by itself and the water will not drain, so you can see in the picture that the water has not been drained overnight.
Fourth: The shower design of this bathroom defaults to a top spray when it is turned on. Take a sip of cold water and experience it for yourself. The handheld showerhead really needs to be held in your hand because it is located relatively low. When you turn on the water, the water will flow straight. If you like this, I did not say!
Fifth: Message board. There is no paper in the high-tech message board. You can write directly on the board. It was no problem at first, but I tried it. You need to use special force, otherwise you will not be able to write.
Sixth: The makeup mirror needs to be plugged in, but there is no socket next to the washbasin. Look for sockets throughout the room.
Seventh: There are no prices for the potato chips in the mini bar and the hotel. I asked the front desk and they said that there is a charge for turning on the TV to see what you can see. When you stay in a hotel, especially in the tourist city of Sanya, who should turn on the TV when entering? If it’s for the sake of environmental protection, can’t you just open the door by default when guests enter?
Eighth: The location of the hotel looks very close to the beach, but check-in requires a detour. Houses are being built on this road, and it is not convenient to go from the hotel to the beach. You have to take a detour.

The service attitude is as good as ever (named by Miss Penny). She upgraded me to a sea view room for free. It was my first time to take out a meal and I didn’t know where to get it. The little guy at the door took the initiative to help me get it. There is a shuttle bus that can be sent to the road in front of the hotel. Across the road is the beach, and most of the time there are no people. If you like a quiet vacation, Haitang Bay is your first choice, and Sunshine One Hotel is your first choice. It was very good to experience the free half-hour singing bowl sound therapy. By the way, I also experienced the full-body SPA in the spa, which was very comfortable.

msg:I didn't see too detailed reviews on Ctrip. I only booked this hotel based on the 4.9 rating, which is equivalent to a hotel blind box. I didn't expect to be very pleasantly surprised when I came in. The hotel's environmental facilities and rooms are very distinctive, and the environmentally friendly materials are used, which is very conceptual. The housekeeper, Eva, is very enthusiastic, and patiently answered our questions late at night, and gave us drinks and snacks. The lighting in the room is adjustable and the a**osphere is very a**ospheric. The breakfast is rich and the dinner is outdoors. The glass swimming pool is also beautiful. There are also various sky bars and nothing to explore and enjoy, and the time is relatively short. Free 5 travel photos, but the photographer's photos were so good, I finally asked for more than 200 photos after adding money. The photos of the whole hotel are very good. I personally think that the relatively traditional hotel in Atlantis is worth experiencing. It is suitable for young people and couples! 1hotel yyds! Continue to live next time! (ps: I hope the hotel has a 24-hour self-service laundry room)
Facilities: very complete
Hygiene: very clean
Environment: very a**ospheric
Serving: Great

I would like to thank Steven again. He sent us a WeChat message one day in advance to ask if we had any special requests. He arranged the room and any special matters we needed, and helped us disinfect the room in advance. He was very considerate and the room was upgraded.
Finally, I want to thank Sophia. She was really nice. She asked us for feedback on the food and beverages and also introduced us to a small farm in the hotel where we could pick food for the children.
Looking forward to our next visit, 1 hotel gave us a wonderful memory, thank you to all the staff.

The buffet seafood bbq in the evening is great. If you stay for two consecutive days, you will receive a free Hainanese chicken hot pot +200, so you can experience the self-service bbq for the whole family. The quality of meat and seafood is very good. Also recommended by Anne, super nice! The swimming pool water is very clean, better than the Rosewood swimming pool where we stayed today.

msg:It can be regarded as a relatively generous hotel among five-star hotels. Although I am not very interested in environmental protection themes, the style of the rooms is not very eye-catching, and the environmentally friendly materials may be bad in some cases. Fortunately, it basically does not affect the use of the hotel, but the characteristics I would still like to experience the hotel. The breakfast is very cost-effective, especially the variety of fresh juices and desserts, which dazzles the children. When we checked in, we met Steven who became our butler. He answered all our questions on WeChat at any time. During the holidays, when the hotel occupancy rate was high, he tried his best to meet our requests. The internet celebrity inflatable unicorn in the suspended swimming pool🦄 can be used by everyone in turns to take photos, it is very photogenic on a sunny day. The boats in the family pool are also available for everyone to take turns and enjoy. The hotel is very close to the beach. It takes about ten minutes to walk. Although it is not the hotel's own beach, it is better because there are fewer people and there are many small crabs. It is a great pleasure to catch them. We also met local villagers casting nets for fishing, which is a scenery that urban children rarely have the opportunity to witness.

The hotel smells delicious as soon as you enter, and the wood and small designs everywhere give you a warm feeling. Go swimming in the jelly pool during the day, it's easy to make a movie. The highlight of the hotel is that the breakfast is very rich, with a lot of juice bread and Chinese food. The hotel is particularly beautiful in the sun. It is worth mentioning that the hotel also has an outdoor ping pong table and basketball stand, which are great for playing. The only drawback is that there are some construction sites around and it is a bit far from the seaside, but everything else is very good.

In addition, mineral water, coffee capsules, and tea are replenished for free, and mini bar drinks and snacks are provided for the day. The breakfast at Sunshine One is the best among the hotels I stayed at this time.

First of all, the hotel will contact the hotel one night before check-in to confirm the arrival time. Afterwards, the butler eleven will add WeChat to understand the preferences of the guests. The caring service provided by eleven during the stay is amazing 👍🏻
Secondly, I used Ctrip's upgrade voucher to directly upgrade to a sea view room facing the sea when I checked in. The view is superb. The overall decoration style of the hotel is simple and environmentally friendly ♻️There are so many mirrors in the room🪞I like it very much, and the wooden room card is also very nice.
Finally, although the location of the hotel is relatively remote, you have to take a taxi to travel.

These can be purchased in Dianping and ** Group purchases, cost-effective Very good!

msg:The Sanya parent-child trip in August was like a dream. We have been here for a few days and the weather has been very sunny. Although it was very sunny during the day, choosing the right hotel is the highest guarantee of a perfect experience! During the trip to Haitang Bay, we checked in at Sunshine One Hotel, which is relatively small and low-key among the parent-child hotels. Before coming here, I was a little worried about whether it would be a bit of a gap, because I just finished Tianyu’s enthusiastic and fulfilling holiday life, but Sunshine One still gave us a lot of surprises. ! First of all, I want to say that this is a hotel with a very emotional a**osphere and careful thought everywhere. Whether it is a guest room that incorporates green and nature, or any restaurant in the hotel, it has a sense of design. Even if you live in a sun room, you can still enjoy it. See a blue sea. Secondly, the cooking skills of the chef and pastry chef are also good! The breakfast variety is very rich, all kinds of bread, desserts, rice rolls are delicious! There is also an exclusive children's breakfast table for children, and the children at home are reluctant to eat it! The camping BBQ dinner outside the hotel lawn at night is not only delicious and rich, but also very relaxing and intoxicating. My husband said it was the most satisfying meal he had eaten in the past few years. Let’s talk about the reservations for children and various activities. Just ask the butler to make an appoin**ent in advance. Here, let’s praise our exclusive butler Morven. Just tell him what you need. In the end, I feel that time flies too fast, and I haven't had enough swimming in the Internet celebrity pool. I heard from the service staff here that the hotel will build an underground passage leading directly to the beach in the future. After completion, I believe that the parent-child check-in experience will be better and more convenient!

msg:I want to write a good review this time. Because I struggled with booking a hotel in Sanya for several days, until I had to make the decision, I was going to stay the next day!
Let me talk about the background first: I am leading a group of three elderly people in my family and a 14-month-old baby by myself. Therefore, my requirements for the room are hygiene first, followed by service. Of course, it would be better if it can provide a pleasant and comfortable experience for the elderly who don't go out much. Also because of the situation of the group members, I am not suitable for changing hotels every day like I used to do when traveling with my best friends. I will not move after I stay, so whether the hotel is good or not will not only affect one night. I've looked at almost all the hotel apar**ents in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay, and I didn't dare to make a decision after seeing the bad reviews. (Of course, due to budget issues, I can’t choose something particularly expensive)
The second summary: the service is very considerate, especially thanks to Penny. The hotel calls guest relations, and I call housekeeping service. The room was clean. I like the hotel design, greening, swimming pool, and the woody fragrance of the toiletries and body lotions.
At first glance, the hotel's appearance cannot compare with the majestic Atlantis or the mangroves, but I like it very much. Not exaggerated or artificial at all, it shows the designer's careful thoughts. The climbing plants planted outside the frames and corridors became the home of the birds in the evening, and they were very lively with their chirping.
I like to stay in new hotels because no matter how well-decorated they are, they cannot withstand the ravages of time. Sunshine 1 is relatively new, but it's not like the Maotai Hotel next door, which just opened this year. It's too new and I'm afraid there will be remnants of renovations, making it unsuitable for babies.
I would like to praise Penny again for her thoughtfulness. I had a lot to do. First, JD.com bought baby water and asked her to deliver it to the room. Then one of the rooms without breakfast had to be replaced by one with breakfast, so she needed to communicate with Ctrip to cancel the original non-cancellable order; There are points to upgrade the room; there are two rooms that need to be together; there are also crib bumpers... everything is taken care of. Penny contacted me on WeChat one day in advance, and after we checked in, she sent her the hotel's various facilities and schedules (the fonts are a bit small and hard to read). I was also given an upgraded refrigerator bar and all-you-can-drink snacks, coffee, mineral water and other food. In fact, no one comes to Sanya to eat these, but the feeling is very good! After learning that I had not left the hotel the next day, they brought a large plate of fruit and 1 hotel logo chocolate!
Some bad reviews said that the hotel was so deserted that it was so dark that they didn't dare to go out at night. In this regard, there is really nothing around the hotel location. You need to take a taxi when you go out. (I thought that taking a taxi was inconvenient and I had to rent a car. In fact, taking a taxi is very convenient. Didi’s taxi response is very fast and there are many taxis. 68 Food Festival Taxi Not a lot, maybe because of the time of my trip?) But I think the hotel is very quiet, and I don’t want people to be jumping around.
The old people are very satisfied. It's a pity that I didn't have the chance to play in the beautiful transparent swimming pool this time with my baby. I just took my baby to tread water. There are many swimming pools here to meet various needs, which is very good. Free fruit tea is provided by the swimming pool, which is a bit like Thai hotel service.
Speaking of which, there are fresh tomatoes (but the skin is too thick and not very tasty), nectarines (my son loves them very much and goes to eat them every day), peanuts (aunt said they are very fragrant) and drinks are available in the hotel lobby every day. .
I like the design of the hotel room, especially the bathtub, large balcony, comfortable wicker chair and sofa that can wrap you up, and finally the thoughtful design - the hidden bedside lamp, which can rotate 270° in the dark to illuminate your thoughts. desired direction.
As for the travel photography service provided, I saw some complaints in the comments, and I also saw many people taking photos at the hotel. I can't comment because I declined the service.
I learned that parking is free. If it is an electric car, there are 9 slow parking and 1 fast parking.
The hotel provides a car to the beach (the kind of car you find on a golf course), you can also walk there yourself. But I didn't go, the elders did. Said it was very close. They also watched how the fishermen divided the fish after working together, haha😃
The Sky Bar is very beautiful, quiet and romantic. I like the swing chairs and the view with open arms. Unfortunately, when I went there, my phone’s battery was at 8% and I was unable to take pictures.
Is there anything else I can help you understand? (My left hand holding the phone feels sore, hahaha)

1. The advantages are relatively new, complete facilities, full-day summer camp activities for children, internet celebrity sky swimming pool, clean water quality, hygienic rooms, and good environmental protection.
2. The breakfast has many varieties and has its own characteristics. Fresh-cut fruits and pasta are very delicious, and the juice is also freshly squeezed, which is not inferior to the first-line big-name hotels.
shortcoming:
1. There is a certain distance from the seaside, walk out of the hotel, cross the road and a windbreak forest, the seaside is public, the waves are relatively large, there is no sunshade, and there is no fresh water for sand washing.
2. The area of ​​the hotel is small, you can just stop and go. The sky swimming pool is the only gimmick. Except for a hotel of the Moutai Group, there are no other buildings around. It is quite desolate. You must have a car to travel.

I also helped us make an appoin**ent for a travel photography service. Shoes and feet are also provided with band-aids. Every detail of the room is very considerate. The mini bar in the hotel is also full of free self-service coffee, which is also delicious, including the toiletries are all made of wood, and there is a 5-minute hourglass in the shower⏳The countdown is really environmentally conscious. The details are very cute.
Those who love trees and woodwork will love this resort

msg:The hotel facilities are very new, with natural style design and texture. It can be seen that they are carefully maintained. The linen is dry and comfortable, and the bed is slightly soft but won't cause any back pain from sleeping on it. The bathtub is designed behind the bed, which is very clever. There are 3-4 restaurants in the hotel, and you can also order takeout. If you go out to eat, Phase 2 of the Duty Free City and 68 Global Food Street are both good choices (it takes 10-15 minutes to take a taxi and the response is fast). The hotel itself does not have a beach. If you want to walk on the beach, you can go to Haitang Square (about 10 minutes by taxi). To watch the sunrise first-class, just open the curtains; you can also see the "moon rising on the sea" and the moonlight filling the sea. There is a giant infinity swimming pool in the hotel courtyard, which is clean, has services, and swimming coaching lessons can be bought (swimming rings, floating boards, bath towels, drinks are available, and you can order meals by scanning the code). So if you are not obsessed with going to the sea, this swimming pool is very pleasant. The breakfast is rich, and I personally feel that Western food tastes better, while the overall flavor of Chinese food is lighter. The hotel staff are warm and friendly. The day before check-in, the housekeeper will add WeChat to issue exclusive coupons for Duty Free City hotels and Atlantis coupons, and they can respond quickly if there are any questions (thank you, butler Rose, for answering various questions and answers). Overall, it was a very pleasant journey.

When I arrived at the hotel early in the morning after my flight was delayed, I was amazed the moment I opened the door. The feeling of returning to nature instantly turned me into vacation mode. Thank you Rose for your meticulous care throughout the whole process. You can take the baby out by yourself. Although it is the off-season, there are still many children's activities. Every staff member is very attentive. The children's play area is full of brothers and sisters with childlike hearts. Every dish in every restaurant is great. Thank you for meeting me and being taken care of warmly at 1Hotel. I will definitely come here~

msg:The whole hotel just wants to give a thumbs up to the young men and women in the Sky Bar.
From the beginning of booking, I called the hotel four times to ask whether the items included in the package need to be booked in advance. The first one added WeChat and deleted me the next day; the next two said that they could not find my order and asked me to call again when the reservation department was at work the next day. The fourth one did add WeChat, but the performance was really unstable. He forgot my package items for a while and forgot to send me the reserved red wine.
I asked about the arrival time in advance before checking in. When checking in at about 3:30, the front desk said that the room was ready but needed to be checked by the supervisor before checking in. I asked what to check? They said to check if there was anything missing. I said I would tell you if I was missing something before checking in. Then they forgot to scan the coupon code for the items in the package for me.
I only found out about this when I went to the Sky Bar for dinner.
I have to say that the scenery, food, drinks and services of the Sky Bar are all great. You can see the sea and sky on one side and the magnificent sunset on the other side. There are swings to swing, which is full of romance. Especially Henry and Coco are gentle and thoughtful. They helped me to get the coupon code and gave me two extra drinks. Regardless of the value, at least it made people feel sincere and service-minded.
In other aspects, the swimming pool is as beautiful as everyone praises, the outdoor camping meal is very nice (the price is also very affordable on **), there is a bonfire party at night, the room is cleaned in time, and the corridor is open, so it will be a bit hot. There is a special children's area for breakfast, donuts, fudge pudding, etc., which the children like very much. The children's projects are relatively tasteless. The children participated in a water gun battle and felt that they had no interest. The children's playground was closed early. The beach is across the street. I asked the customer service at night and they said that I could go, but the concierge's brother conscientiously persuaded me to quit because there was no light and there were many mosquitoes.
That's basically it. It affected my mood for the first three days of my trip. On the check-out day, my husband had to leave after breakfast. I didn't want to stay any longer and would not stay there again.

I like the woody and natural style
Special thanks to Miss Anne at the front desk
Help us apply for a free upgrade to the little yellow duck parent-child room

I love the woody fragrance as soon as I enter the lobby. It’s a pity that the aromatherapy is not sold, but all the toiletries are woody fragrance, which can be bought
The hotel has a big indoor children's playground - Xiao Zimiao, there are not many people, and there are many summer camp activities
Parent-child room, children like it very much. There is a sofa bed with ducklings, a small tent, bathrobes, toiletries, etc.
The swimming rings rented by the swimming pool are beautiful and suitable for taking pictures
The sand digging props should have been purchased, but the kind administrator gave us a set haha
The room facilities are all available and the details are well done
The Green House Chinese restaurant for dinner is delicious. Cantonese cuisine. The black garlic and maw chicken soup is so delicious. The children’s meal is provided as a gift. The rice dregs baby made two bowls of fried rice. There is no charge for the extra order
It's a pity that I didn't have time to go to Yixiaoyuan for lunch. I must go next time

All in all, Sunshine One has a very high rating in my heart. It is very suitable for taking a baby. It is a hotel that I will definitely go back to. 🏨

She helped us send our luggage to the room. The hotel as a whole is environmentally friendly, and there are various unimaginable designs everywhere. Every corner of the green plants planted on the exterior walls of the ladder bridge, wooden room cards, etc. makes people feel very comfortable. The sea seen from the bed and the infinity pool seen from the balcony are full of sunshine. The hotel's breakfast is also very rich, with a variety of freshly baked bread and desserts, freshly squeezed various vegetable juices, freshly ground coffee, soy milk fritters, and various types of porridge and flour. In short, it is a very good accommodation experience (❁´ ◡`❁)*✲ﾟ*

It really gave me a feeling of going home before I checked in. Everything was arranged, but I was afraid that the arrangement was not in place! Well done a lot 🤣
Let’s talk about the hotel. I went directly to the Sunshine One Hotel from Yanlord Crown, so there must be a comparison. I felt a little lost just entering the hall, but! I like it more and more, the more I look at it, the better it looks!
My son lived in Houhai if Haiyunjian, Yanlord Crowne Plaza Hotel in Haitang Bay and here. In the end he said he liked this one the most.
By the way, his desserts are really great! The point where I could eat five! !
It's pictured above for all to see. If it feels average, it must be my photography skills and it has nothing to do with the hotel🤣🤣

msg:I have stayed in all the popular hotels in Haitang Bay. I wanted to try something new this time. I chose the relatively small 1 hotel and was really pleasantly surprised. The hotel facilities are very new, and the overall feeling of Miami is fake.
Room: The overall size is quite large. I chose a sea view room with a good view from the balcony. Because the beach is separated by a road, it is relatively far away from the sea view.
Breakfast: The breakfast is very rich. You can see that the croissants are freshly baked in the oven, which is a plus. And there are directly freshly squeezed juices, which are very healthy.
Service: Before check-in, there will be a staff member who will contact and add WeChat. Everything is fine, and the check-in needs are basically met. I would like to thank Anne, because this is a birthday trip, Anne specially presented us with desserts and hotel mascot dolls, too Caring!
The price/performance ratio of the hotel in Haitang Bay is very high. Although the beach is separated by a road, there is a hotel battery car to pick you up. The beach is not crowded because there are no commercial marine entertainment projects. We think it is a plus for those who like quietness.
I will bring my family to stay next time.

Anyway, the beautiful people are super nice. Next time I come to Haitang Bay to play I also looked for Penny and recommended it to friends around me. Although I stayed for one night, I was told that there were travel photos and children's games as gifts, which was super considerate.
Facilities: I was really surprised when I stayed in the hotel for the first time. Because I was going to the duty-free shop to buy things, I only stayed in Haitang Bay for one night. I booked a cheap and cost-effective one on Ctrip. I am very satisfied. My mother also said that this is the best hotel I have stayed in recently. Although I stayed in Wanning before, it was also a very good hotel, but it is relatively old. Sunshine is very new. The style is also very modern. I like it very much. The infinity pool is also super nice, I think it should be nice to take pictures of mermaids.
Hygiene: Hygiene is also very clean, and the drying rack on the balcony is absolutely perfect. Other hotels have caught me, this is very good.
Environment: The overall environment is very good. I live in a sea view room, so the view is pretty good. It is across a road from the sea.
There are not many hotels this time, but overall I am very satisfied, and I will come again next time💗💗

1. Environment: The exterior of the hotel is designed in a retro industrial style. The black iron + log material runs through the entire design of the hotel. From the outside to the inside, it is full of details, as small as trash cans and disposable items. It is consistent with the style pursued by the hotel, which shows the hotel's care and attention.
The park is very large, the grass is flat, green and spacious, and there are many green plants that match each other. There are three large swimming pools, including a constant temperature area and an adult area. Please see the hotel introduction for details. The environment is beautiful.
2. Service: From the moment you get off the car, the concierge will pick up your luggage. Manager Morven helped us check in and upgraded us to a room facing the sea view. It was awesome. Thank you morven, we will follow up on our needs later and send some information about the hotel to WeChat, which is very considerate. Because the flight was delayed, we were also given an extra 2 hours to check out.
3. Food: Breakfast is from the famous Yichu, which is highly praised. Among all the big brand hotels in Sanya, they are the most exquisite and delicious. The bread is freshly baked, and there are also ** sweets and special drinks every day. Both Chinese and Western food are very delicious, and the dining environment is very good. Of course, there is also the green house, and the roasted chicken in the farmyard is also a must.
4. This hotel is very cost-effective. For the same 1,000 yuan, the comfort, environment, hygiene, service, and food are all very good. I will stay again.
5. Finally, let’s talk about the compartment. It is very good. I am a light sleeper, and I can’t have a voice.

The hotel's travel photography can produce blockbuster movies in every corner of the hotel. I am very satisfied and worth recommending! The housekeeper, Steven, is very warm and thoughtful, and responds immediately when contacted at any time, very satisfied. The fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel has to pass the road to get to the beach, which is very inconvenient. I heard that an underground tunnel is under construction, and I hope it can be realized as soon as possible. In a word, we will stay again, good memories.

We arrived at night, and the service staff was very enthusiastic to help us with our luggage. After opening the door and entering the hotel lobby, a burst of fragrance came over us. I usually don't like the smell of perfume, but this smell is very comfortable. The check-in staff at the front desk are very enthusiastic.

msg:Originally, the last hotel of this trip to Sanya was Mangrove Resort World. When I got there, my god, the smell of urine made me run away. I hurriedly checked out and chose a hotel again. I had a choice barrier. Immediately, I was blindsided. I have basically stayed in the old five-star hotels in Haitang Bay. I decided to try Sunshine One, a new hotel. There are various surprises in the hotel, such as infinity pool, small seedlings, including room cards and toiletries. Every new thing is amazing, I didn't expect a new hotel located in a remote place to be so perfect. The most worth mentioning is that I met Allen, a good manager, who really responded to every request. Next time I go or recommend by a friend, I will definitely choose Sunshine One. I hope this hotel will get better and better in the future!

They are trying their best to provide services. Ms. Penny contacted the store in advance before arriving at the store, and the arrangement was complete. My son really likes the infinity pool here. He swam twice a day during his stay. He really liked it. The breakfast is also quite rich, and the service is particularly good. I sincerely recommend that friends who travel to Sanya also come to Sunshine One Hotel to check in.

msg:The breakfast is very rich, and there is also a special breakfast area for children.
The cooking skills of the Green House restaurant are good, and the service attitude is super good. I remember that I said something cold at that time, and the waiter asked if I needed a shawl. At the same time, there are also children's meals, which can feel the care.
The indoor children's playground should be relatively large, and there are many children's activities, both outdoor and indoor.
The housekeeper Kitty is like a jingle cat. She is online 24 hours a day, answering every question and satisfying her needs. The lock of the suitcase couldn't be opened, so I immediately arranged for a master from the engineering depar**ent to come. I want to make milk for the children at night, so I immediately ask the waiter to deliver a box of mineral water to the room. In short, almost any demand can be arranged clearly.
Except that you can't walk to the beach, everything else is OK.

The only downside is that it is far from the beach, some rooms are still being renovated and the elevator room is a bit smelly, and the opening time of the swimming pool is a bit late from 10 o'clock. Everything else is great, Green House Restaurant and Sky Bar are worth recommending

The hotel is an environmentally friendly concept, and every place has a sense of design. I couldn't help but take a lot of pictures. The hotel spa is also very good and worth experiencing. Green House Chinese food is good, and the environment is beautiful. The breakfast buffet is also very popular. The overall style is Western-style, but there are also optional noodles, which can be matched with side dishes by yourself. There are not too many items, but it is very appetizing and tastes good.

Many materials are made of environmentally friendly recycled materials, such as flower pots made of coconut shells, and cups cut from red wine bottles. Parent-child activities are also very rich, and children like it very much. The hotel's glass swimming pool is great. You can see the bottom when you swim. The vision is very deep. It's a good experience. The night view of Skyba is very beautiful. Drinking a glass of cocktail at night makes you feel good. Here, I would also like to thank Eva sincerely. The service was very good and she helped us make reservations for the whole process. When we left, I also gave us a straw hat, a souvenir and good memory worth cherishing.

A slight disadvantage is that the hotel is a little far from the beach, but there will be a battery car to pick you up at the back door of the hotel. You can walk to the beach in two or three minutes, and there are few people

The design and operation concept of the hotel are very natural, with a lot of solid wood, pebbles, and plants, creating a feeling of natural rest and residence.
The breakfast is rich in variety, with a lot of fresh fruits and breads. The package I chose also includes free meals and cocktails for two. The food in the sky bar tastes very good. I recommend everyone to drink "Begonia Fisherman", but the weather is too hot, so sit for a while Just sweating, haha. There is a farmer's orchard in the lobby, which provides fresh fruit and welcome drinks every day. The SPA has Yuebishi products, which are complete for men and women.
The infinity pool is the highlight. Many people can also learn diving and mermaids.
It's a pity that the hotel doesn't have a private beach, but swimming in the hotel, having a spa, drinking some wine, and having a picnic on the lawn are enough for urbanites to check in and post on Moments.
Butler Allen's service is very considerate, thank you.

The only thing is, when you come out of the elevator room, go to the door on the right to go to the room with the prefix 2. There is an overpass. Going out suddenly is always a little bit like a fear of heights. I don't like it very much. Widen it a bit, or set up a floor-to-ceiling glass to block it, for psychological safety.

Facilities: All the supplies in the room are complete, the quality is very good, and they are very new. During the stay, 3 swimming pools were open, and the Internet celebrity suspended swimming pool is great. The complimentary pool booster allows me to experience the feeling of swimming in the water even if I can't swim.

Hygiene: Hygiene is very good, both overall and details are impeccable. When I passed by, I saw the cleaning lady cleaning very carefully.

Environment: The environmental protection concept hotel seems to be in the forest. The hotel has a great sense of design, and the experience of restaurants and bars is very good. Taking pictures is very good.

Service: Before coming to Sanya, Anne, the hotel staff member, added me on WeChat. On the day I arrived in Sanya, she told me the weather, traffic and surrounding conditions, and told me in detail about the hotel's various facilities and business hours, which made my stay very convenient. During the stay, I always cared about greetings and solved my problems in time. Thank you Anne very very much. The other staff are also very serious and responsible, and the experience is 100 points!

msg:I really like the style of Sunshine One, I knew it was a 1 hotel as soon as I entered the hotel. Breakfast in the green house in the morning, full of green plants, oxygen inhalation journey. Even the texture of the tablecloth and dinner plate is in my aesthetics, and I want to buy a full set of tableware home haha. The breakfast juice is also very good-looking... It's really a bit of a loss to come to Sanya and not live in a 1 hotel.
I would like to commend the butler Anne, she is super caring, she helped us carry our luggage when we checked in, and gave us a thoughtful gift 🎁 when we left!

1 Hotel is a hotel group in the United States. There is only one in Sanya in China. It is distributed in Hollywood, New York, Miami and Hawaii in the United States. Everyone wants to live in it! !

  Here I would like to give special praise to the hotel customer service Shi Xin, who is really gentle and caring.
Facilities: The design of the hotel is a combination of a star hotel and an art hotel, with design and luxury everywhere. The most important thing is that the equipment is very new.
  The sky pool is very fun and very good.
Feeling: I take my children to Sanya for vacation every year. This time is the most comfortable one. I don’t want to come out after staying in the hotel. The hotel's children's playground is very fun and there are many meaningful activities.

msg:The design of the hotel is spot on. The room is very comfortable and the bed is very soft. On the first night, I asked Shi Xin butler to change to a room on a higher floor because of the air conditioning problem. The service is very good. The only downside is that it is not directly accessible to the beach, you need to cross the road. If you just want to see the sea view, it is recommended to play in the hotel, especially the supporting activities of the hotel are some parent-child activities every hour, which is quite suitable for mothers to bring children to play. Five-star value for money 👍🏻

The lobby is located on the 3rd floor, unlike other designs on the first floor. There are also several open-air swimming pools, which are very friendly to friends who love swimming. The most considerate thing is the one-to-one butler service. In any case, you don’t have to bother to find the front desk, just connect to the butler via WeChat. Amway's zoe butler, who served us attentively, helped us in a timely and efficient manner, from check-in reminders to travel weather reminders, including recommendations for nearby food, as well as our temporary needs, and really felt the feeling of being served. I was also experienced by my friend Amway this time. If I come to Sanya next time, I will consider this place and recommend it to other friends~

Very kindly sent us to the room, explained carefully, a very cute little girl wearing glasses. There are so many good things, I don't know where to exaggerate. First of all, the check-in is very fast and the attitude is very good. Whether it is the little brother who gets off the car to help carry the luggage, the front desk staff, the aunt who cleans, or the lifeguard next to the swimming pool, everyone is very nice! I lost my mobile phone, and a little brother accompanied us to look for it. When I quarreled with my boyfriend, I tried to persuade him to fight, haha. Then there is the swimming pool, each of which is very clean. This hotel is really clean. I have stayed in many five-star hotels in Sanya. Sunshine One Hotel is very cost-effective! The swimming pool is really good, and there is also a 10-minute booster, which is fun. In short, I regretted that I booked for one night, which is much better than Aomoutu. But there is a phenomenon. During breakfast, there was a boy who asked me for a good review in the restaurant. I won’t say his name, but after I gave him a good review, he never helped me collect anything. Instead, he had another round face. The boys have been helping me pack my things. (Breakfast bread is so delicious woo woo woo)

In terms of scale, it is definitely not the biggest in Haitang Bay, but fortunately, the hotel is new enough, trendy enough, and has a feel. Not to mention the famous internet celebrity swimming pool, which attracts countless young ladies to check in. It really looks good no matter how you take pictures. The concept of environmental protection is also deeply rooted in the hearts of the people all the way. The green plants extend to the room. I saw 3 pots of green plants in one room. Sunshine is the first one
In terms of service, this hotel is also quite good. Ms. Shi Xin, the housekeeper, communicated before moving in, gave introductions when moving in, and responded to any problems. Give her a thumbs up
As for whether it depends on the sea, I think so. Anyway, the main view of the sea in Haitang Bay is that you can’t go into the water, so it’s not that important. And let’s just stay in the hotel and don’t go anywhere. This is the correct opening of the resort hotel. the way
TIPS
The star bar in the hotel is very suitable for producing films. There is a car that can be delivered directly to the door and across the road to the beach. The dolls in the hotel are quite unique.

The sink is at the head of the bed, which will affect the baby's rest. After communicating with the housekeeper, kitty, he helped us apply with the manager, and changed to a garden view suite the next day! The room doubled in size in an instant! It is recommended to bring a baby to the preferred suite. If the budget is sufficient, it is best not to consider the ordinary room type. When leaving, the front desk also sent a bottle of Estee Lauder's face cream sample, which is great! Recommended by the Green House restaurant, stay for three nights and eat two meals (must order the dross vinegar hot pot, crispy Wenchang chicken~) Breakfast is a little simpler compared to other hotels, especially the fruit, which is repeated for three days.

Speaking of shortcomings, breakfast is 280 per person but the food is not worth the price. The hotel does not have a beach, the surrounding area is relatively desolate, and there are not many places for entertainment. The bonfire party is only available on Friday and Saturday. The TV in the guest room cannot cast the screen. It is boring to soak in the room and there is nothing to watch. There are too few meal packages in the hotel, and there is nothing to choose from. Afternoon tea is just a set meal. I ordered a snack platter at the sky bar. If I want to add some grilled skewers, I can't order it alone. I must order the 698 barbecue set. . . How can we order so many for just two of us?

The only downside is that you have to cross a road to walk to the beach, but the net red swimming pool and meals are more than enough to make up for it. Xiaozimiao also has a lot of activities, both adults and children have fun😃 In the swimming pool room, children can swim directly in the water, very happy and more private.

After seven days of travel, due to flight delays, I went around and went around again. We are a family of three traveling with a baby who is eight and a half months old. What we value most is the quietness of the hotel, the cleanliness and comfort of the room, and the room that can accommodate our full luggage. Two 28-inch boxes, various tote bags after play, and baby carriages can be put down very well. The hotel's breakfast is also delicious, and the children's playground is also very good.

msg:The facilities and services of the hotel are very good.
Steven, the guest director, first added WeChat and asked about my check-in requirements in advance. After check-in, he introduced the hotel's facilities and surrounding travel guides in great detail, which was very considerate.
Although I didn't see the sunrise due to the weather, the scenery is still very good (mapped).
The bread at the hotel's breakfast is very delicious, but the adjus**ent mode of the lights in the guest room is a bit confusing. Sometimes there will be conflicts between the two switches.
The voices of the customer service ladies are very sweet, and the Hainanese chicken rice is also very delicious.
This time I was on vacation before May 1st. I went to Sanya by myself, and I didn't want to be too busy to catch up with the attractions. The location of the hotel is very close to Yalong Bay and Wuzhizhou Island, and it is also very suitable for sitting on the balcony of the hotel to relax.

msg:A very satisfying experience, thanks to the housekeeper Anne for contacting me one day in advance, helping me determine the check-in time, arranging a room type facing the sea and in the middle, and finally helping us to delay check-out. The dining experience in each restaurant in the hotel is also very good, and the price is not too expensive in a five-star hotel. Although it is the off-season, it is still worthy of praise to insist on this kind of five-star service. Especially the Green House Restaurant is worth a visit. The Chinese restaurant serves Hainan special meals. The manager Nacy is also very professional. The recommended food is very good. He also repeatedly told us that we are afraid that we will waste too much. It is in line with the theme of the hotel, saving, environmental protection, and regeneration. We stayed for three days, and if we hadn't already booked our itinerary, we really wanted to stay for a few more days.
Facilities: very good and new
Hygiene: very good
Environment: quiet, comfortable and hygienic
Service: in line with five-star standards

msg:I personally don't like old hotels, so I compared all the star-rated hotels in Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay on the Internet before my trip, and I chose this one. The experience is really good. It is not far from Atlantis, Wuzhizhou Island, and Houhai Village, and you can get there quickly by taxi.
The hotel is relatively new, and I like the design style very much. Almost every staff member has a bright smile. The overall service attitude of the waiters in the restaurant, guest room, children's area, swimming pool, and concierge depar**ent is very good. In addition, the overall hygienic situation that I pay special attention to is also very good . I stayed for three days, and I really like the breakfast and Chinese restaurant here. I haven't had time to experience the sky bar yet, so I'll save it for next time.
2 suggestions: 1. The wooden comb in the guest room is not very practical, especially unfriendly to long hair; 2. The quality of shampoo and conditioner is average, not as good as the hotel we will stay in the next few days. It is recommended to replace it. But overall, I can still give it a 5-point praise!

msg:Staying in this hotel is really paying for the appearance. The environment of the whole hotel is very beautiful, suitable for a leisurely vacation, and casual photos are very good. The hotel is based on the theme of environmental protection, and the entire hotel area is non-smoking, which is very suitable for families with children! This is really a big compliment! I am also very grateful to our housekeeper, kitty, for her considerate service these days, and any problems during the stay can be perfectly solved!
However, there must be a certain degree of environmental protection. Next, there are some small suggestions. I hope the hotel can adopt them and improve them.
1. There is no refrigerator in the room at this price, which is really unsatisfactory. After all, Sanya is relatively hot, so you need to put some fruits or drinks in the refrigerator to refrigerate.
2. Because the theme is environmental protection, there is no disposable garbage bag in the trash can in the room. As a result, some wet garbage and food eaten in the room are easy to smell. Either ask the cleaning to clean it up immediately, or put the trash can in the room Go outside the door, and there is only a trash can in the room, which is very troublesome
3. I personally think that the bedding is relatively hard. Although the hotel put a small card on the head of the bed indicating that it is organic cotton, it is really uncomfortable and not skin-friendly
The above are some small suggestions during the stay. Generally speaking, Sunshine One is still a good choice for vacation and leisure! Will consider coming again next time

msg:The hotel is very new and beautiful, environmentally friendly yet luxurious. In recent years, more and more hotels have joined the ranks of environmental protection, but most of them are mere formalities, such as Sunshine One, which uses large solar energy to generate electricity, uses waste wood and volcanic stones for decoration, and waste wine bottles to make glasses is really rare. And it is very beautiful and has a sense of design, which has been greatly recommended to friends. So stick to being yourself, and don’t be swayed by those bad reviews on the Internet about not changing spare parts. They don’t have this awareness yet, and time will change them. Secondly, to blow up the hotel’s catering, we need to give the food and beverage director a full five-star. During the stay, we had meals in Yichu, Green House, Sky Bar, and Yibian respectively. We were very satisfied with every meal, and the dishes and services were impeccable. In addition, the most satisfying thing is the entire tableware, which is very beautifully arranged, and even breakfast can become a visual feast. Third, the swimming pool is really beautiful, and it is bigger than expected, and it is heated at a constant temperature. It may be the only outdoor swimming pool in Sanya. Fourth, the service staff are young and energetic, and the sisters in the room are very enthusiastic and responsive. I asked for late check out due to flight delays, and I quickly gave a satisfactory answer, thank you very much.
Finally, let me talk about a few flaws. First, the bathtub in the room is behind the head of the bed. The design is very strange, and you will smell the sewer when you sleep. There is a five-minute hourglass in the second bathroom. The idea of saving water is very good, but can you make a wall-mounted one? The big wooden block behind the hourglass occupies the entire groove, and there is no place for some bathing and skin care products for female residents. let go. The third is also the point I am most dissatisfied with. The coffee capsule machine is a bonus item, but no capsules were put in when I checked in on the first day. I called and asked, and I was a little confused when I said that I didn't deserve these things. Well, I’ll just drink black coffee. After the machine is warmed up, I can’t find a suitable coffee cup. In the end, I can only use a Marco cup to reach the mouth of the coffee machine at an angle. It’s a joke. So this discordant photo is included in all the beautiful photos below. My personal suggestion is that if you don’t have an espresso cup and you don’t want to serve milk balls, then don’t put the capsule coffee machine in it, otherwise it will cause trouble.

The hotel with the concept of environmental protection is full of modernity. The view from the room is quite good.
The front desk upgraded the room and the service was quite good. The most distinctive feature is the large outdoor swimming pool, which looks like a blue sea from a distance.
Outside the corridor of the room, the growing green plants show vigorous vitality, which makes people feel the warmth of spring.
A particularly quiet place, as if this is a paradise, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, the green house food tastes great.

After eating breakfast, skybar dinner, bonfire dinner, and a light meal in a western restaurant, all meals are basically settled in the hotel. There are many highlights of breakfast, such as a variety of fruit and vegetable juices, freshly baked sandwiches, dessert cakes and other categories. There are basically bonfire dinners, but the types of freshly grilled dishes can be more abundant, such as seafood barbecues should be more. The skybar has a good choice of background music, and the lighting is full of a**osphere.
The service is very good, the housekeeper kitty responded to various inquiries and needs in a timely manner, and even sent dolls for children.
In terms of parenting and children, meet the basic requirements. There is a relatively large indoor playground and some play courses, which are enough for two or three-year-old children.
The biggest shortcoming is that there are too many mosquitoes, but the hotel staff are more timely in providing mosquito repellent water.
Overall very satisfied, would recommend.

This swimming pool can only be swam if you stay in a pool room. Because it is the off-season, it is basically exclusive Haha.
Breakfast: Recommended by a friend, it is really good. The breakfast of the two days is different. The special refueling and energy source are very delicious and delicious.

Every area in the hotel is a landscape, every corner of the wall is decorated with fresh green moss, the wooden fragrance from the elevator is unforgettable, and the suspended transparent swimming pool is full of fun, no need to go to the beach to play wild , The hotel lifeguards are quite responsible, and they will also guide children to swim. In short, it can be seen that 1 hotel spends a lot of money on maintenance every day.
The breakfast is even more surprising. The quality is quite good. There are a variety of freshly baked breads. Guests can choose their own freshly squeezed fruit juices delivered directly from the farm, and they can mix and match as they please.
My customer service butler, Zoe, is very nice. He is attentive and responsible. He recommended various hotel activities for us. In the evening, the children want to eat oranges when they want to take a bath. Unfortunately, the welcome fruit at the front desk has already been collected. Zoe contacted the customer service center and sent a hearty fruit plate. It was really a surprise. up! Will come again!

It's a pity that I didn't live in a selected room. In order to confirm the information was submitted three minutes late, the selected sea view room was booked. Hope to have the opportunity to experience the selected room type next time.

U1S1, isn't the correct way to open Sanya is to play in the hotel? ! Although the facilities around the hotel are not fully up yet. But for those of us who enjoy our vacation by self-driving, it will not be affected at all.

Before check-in: Allen, the housekeeper, kindly sent relevant information about the hotel as a reference.

During the stay: Allen will respond to any problems we encounter, respond to messages in a timely manner, and deal with them efficiently. Add chicken thighs and chicken thighs!

It is worth boasting that:
There are AC charging piles on the second floor of the parking lot, which is very convenient;
As soon as you enter the lobby, the low-key woody fragrance instantly turns into vacation mode, which makes it easy to relax;
Many areas of the hotel have a sense of design, which is very easy to produce;
You can really try the exquisite desserts in the breakfast;
The latex mattress is really comfortable, and the room is also soundproof. Although there are occasional constructions near the hotel, you can't hear anything when you close the windows;
Auntie cleans very frequently, once in the morning and in the afternoon;
There is also an exclusive bonfire dinner on Friday and Saturday;
There is a set meal in the Sky Bar that is big and delicious, and the price is high. There are scenes, music and a**osphere. The disadvantage is that the top floor was too windy that night, and the dishes were cold after a while.

Before checking out, because I forgot to make an appoin**ent in advance for the 5% off tax-free discount at the hotel, I immediately contacted the butler to see if I could help. As expected, Allen, who is very resourceful, quickly helped me solve it.

Finally, I would like to thank a little brother at the front desk for giving me the straw hat when I left. I was so happy when I received it. There is also the lady at the 1 HTB HIVE customer service center who left personal items in the room when I checked out. The hotel staff contacted me in time to keep them safe and called me to confirm whether they needed to be mailed. Really thanks again 🙏! I will recommend it to friends around me, and I will come again if I have the opportunity in the future~

I ordered a takeaway, but it didn't arrive in my room half an hour after it arrived. I really couldn't wait any longer, so I went out to pick it up, and met a "competent" butler on the way, playing with the phone in one hand and strolling slowly in the corridor with the spilled takeaway in the other. I’m really angry, or you can say that you can’t send it off. Before you come, the hotel promises to go to the nearby beach, and the hotel will pick you up for free. When you need this service, the hotel tells me that the pick-up is only limited to the hotel. Finally, let’s talk After the room is cleaned, the disposable slippers and disposable items are not replaced. The experience is really bad. I stayed in 3 hotels in Sanya. Very small, sorry to die

msg:I strongly recommend everyone to check in at Sunshine One. The environmental protection concept/hotel design/service is really amazing. Along the way, I stayed in four or five hotels in Haitang Bay. This hotel is definitely the most cost-effective one. Let me share with you my experience Please feel free to check in, I'm going to turn on the chatterbox mode! Environment: The hotel really has a sense of design. There are green plants everywhere, which makes people feel very fresh. The concept of environmental protection has really been infected. The room card/clothes hanger/water cup/and many facilities in the lobby are really comprehensive. At night , all the lights in the park will be turned on. It is beautiful and has a sense of a**osphere. Of course, the hotel does not have its own beach. This is a pity. There is a battery car that can help you to the intersection of the beach, and then you can walk to the beach in about three minutes. The concierge The little brother in the depar**ent is very handsome, and the service is also very thoughtful. Although it is a wild beach, the hotel at the intersection is equipped with towels/water/sunscreen and other items. It is really considerate and thoughtful. The water is very clear. Sitting on the beach, lay a bed Blanket, watch the ebb and flow of the tide, listen to the sound of the waves, and watch the sunset with the one you love. It’s really comfortable. You can sit for a whole day and feel very relaxed and comfortable. There are not too many people cleaning it. It’s really good Resort feeling; facilities: Built in 2020, it is really new, it looks very clean and comfortable, from the public facilities to the room decoration, it is completely modern and minimalist, the bedding in the room is really comfortable, it is really OK It satisfies the sleepiness of the big slob. The lighting in the room has different adjus**ent modes, which can be adjusted according to the current feeling. It is not too convenient; all the bath and skin care products in the room are made of woody fragrance, which is really super cute; the room is equipped with a small blackboard , You can write whatever you want, this compares many old-fashioned hotels, okay? The constant temperature swimming pool is so cool, you can soak in the bath all day, there are deck chairs and parasols next to it, the experience is really good, you can take many beautiful photos, super outstanding In addition, the spa is really good. You can choose different packages. The technology is really remarkable. Get up in the morning and go to the gym to get a card. Although the gym is not very big, it has all the equipment you need. It's quite satisfactory, and it's ok for a resort hotel. Hygiene: Everything in the new hotel is clean, and the cleaning lady is very serious. The room is cleaned very well, and she also helps to organize clothes and put cosmetics, which is really considerate; Service: Really professional and enthusiastic. When you arrive at the hotel, there is a porter who will help you store your luggage and guide you to check in. After arriving at the front desk, the young lady has a very warm reception. She helps arrange rooms on high floors, introduces the hotel's business premises, and reminds you of the breakfast time. It is also recommended to add the butler’s WeChat, who will help to book discounts at duty-free shops, introduce the contents of the package, help with reservations, and help plan travel routes. It’s so considerate. The most important thing is that it’s always online. , as long as the customer needs it, the kind that can appear immediately is really considerate! The attitude of other staff is also very good. The aunt who helps clean up the room, the lifeguard by the swimming pool, and all the service staff in the lobby will greet you proactively, and they are very patient and responsive to questions. Of course, I also encountered some minor problems during this trip, but I don’t think it will affect the overall stay experience, so they can be ignored. This vacation is really fun, and I will experience it next time!

I like the decoration style, and the hotel's environmental protection concept and design sense everywhere are great. The staff of the hotel are very meticulous and thoughtful, especially thanks to Zoe, who is serious in his work and enthusiastic in service. He really puts the needs of the guests first. I am very touched. Before leaving, I gave my baby a small doll and a straw hat. I originally booked a room for one night, but I went to live in Yalong Bay the next day. Thinking about it, I still felt that I didn’t stay long enough. Sunshine One really surpassed those old five-star hotels in Yalong Bay. The sense of experience is more suitable for young people. Temporarily decided to go back to play for two more days, I strongly recommend everyone to come, the price/performance ratio is also good!

Both the facilities and the service are much better than those old-fashioned parent-child hotels! The butler Anne is very enthusiastic and considerate in service. She confirmed the arrival time, then waited at the front desk and led us to the room. The hotel is rated as a designer hotel. Every corner of the hotel is really good. The hotel’s breakfast is also very delicate and delicious. This time I stayed in four or five hotels in Sanya. Sunshine One is definitely the most cost-effective. I recommend it to everyone!

msg:Sunshine One has been on the list of hotels I’m interested in for a long time, but thinking that this trip is mainly for bringing children, so it was not my best choice at first (I was worried that it would not be parent-child enough) but it turned out to be the one with the best experience of my stay during this trip In the hotel, in the past three days, every service staff I met made me feel very good, with a perfect attitude and fast response. Here I would like to give a special compliment to my housekeeper, Morven, who was responsive to requests during the stay and dealt with problems very quickly. Not only helped me upgrade the room type, but also helped me deal with the delay in check-out without saying a word;
Let’s talk about parents and children. After checking out from Tianyu, I was worried that my children would not think it was interesting enough. Later, I realized that I was too worried. The amu*****t park was too busy to leave. The parent-child activities are small but exquisite, and the staff are very attentive to the children. Compared with other parent-child hotels, I prefer Sunshine One's parent-child hotels.
Secondly, the hotel is really too big, and it won’t be as busy as a vegetable market. The breakfast really lives up to its reputation. At this moment, I am missing the service of Sunshine One at the Intercontinental in the Mid-Levels Peninsula. Compared with the environment, the contrast is too great😭
I will give this treasure hotel Amway to everyone around me, as well as my butler Morven, looking forward to seeing you again!

Before I checked in, GRO Zoe got in touch with me for better service. During the stay, they also thoughtfully upgraded us! Very satisfied during the entire stay. No matter from the decoration of the hotel or the service of the service staff of the entire hotel. Although it is not a parent-child hotel in the sense, the parent-child paradise is also very spacious and comfortable. Children's facilities are also available, which is much better than parent-child hotels in some senses! This time, I would like to thank Zoe for her service. It is nothing more than a home away from home! awesome! ! !
The hotel's heated swimming pool is very beautiful, and the temperature of the day will not feel cold. Green plants can be seen everywhere in the hotel, which makes people feel better.
Next time I come to Hainan, I will continue to choose 1hotel! Thank you Zoe for your meticulous service!
Facilities: Great! Great greenery and decoration
Hygiene: very clean and comfortable, the concept of simplicity and environmental protection is fully reflected
Environment: The combination of green plants and industrial style is really good
Service: very caring, 💯 full marks

I thought it was a pity that Sunshine One did not have a direct access to the beach, but I found out after I checked in, but there were surprises everywhere. The appearance of the hotel is more industrial style, the room is super large, the sea view room is fortunate to see the sunrise, the breakfast is rich and high quality. The service of the hotel staff is even more meticulous and thoughtful. I have to give my butler Sabrina a thumbs up. She gave me red wine and made dinner reservations for me and my mother for the careful and surprise arrangement of the hotel itinerary. Before leaving, she also satisfied us. The wish to go to the Sky Bar to take pictures👍👍👍The hotel has a constant temperature swimming pool, and there are free photos. It can be said that it is really worth staying for three days and two nights. Highly recommended!

msg:I have been paying attention to the hotel for a long time. The first impression is the theme of environmental protection, and I will check in on weekends. In fact, parent-child activities are generally considered when bringing children, but this time I was attracted by the hotel's environmental protection culture. Facts have proved that the trip is worthwhile😊
Service: The concierge will take the initiative to help with the luggage when you get off the bus, and also give the child a starfish necklace, which is very cute; the check-in at the front desk is very fast, and the intern una at the front desk will also ask if you can add WeChat to help provide services. Such inquiries are very pleasant Comfortable; in-store breakfast and pool service staff are very good
Facilities: The room facilities are still very good, but in a hotel with such good hardware, it is recommended to replace the hair dryer, and there is also a mini bar in the room. Since the charges should be clearly marked, but the inquiry is only on the TV (basically the TV will not be turned on)
Check-in: The biggest reason for paying attention to the hotel is that the photos are very good-looking, and the film is really good

After the Spring Festival this year, the second brush with Sunshine One, the housekeeper Morven is very good and professional~
The fly in the oin**ent feels that the parent-child room is not worth it, and the view is not right. It is an ordinary room with climbing mats, tents, two dolls, and a sofa bed. There are no sink pedals, toilet covers, and bath toys for children.
But overall it's still great! I like this place very much. It is very suitable for driving here to have a good rest and walk the baby. The hotel's hygiene, service, activities, and meals are also very good! The breakfast is stable, and the freshly baked croissant is a must! Archery is fun, Coach Sun is also very professional and friendly~
Will bring family and friends to live again in the future

msg:The reason for staying at this hotel is to read online reviews and Ctrip recommendations. I give it an 85. The size of the hotel is small, and there is not much space for activities. The sky bar on the roof is simply drunk on a windy day. The meals are quite satisfactory, and the only highlight is the pasta. The boiled noodles are really delicious. Staff training is in place. But the lack of hardware is indeed a pity. And the price is not cheap. At least the price/performance ratio is not very satisfactory. What impressed me the most during my trip to Sanya was the price increase. Most of the hotel prices in Haitang Bay have increased by 15-20%. It seems that we want to make up for the losses of the epidemic in the past few years as soon as possible. But the facilities are still those facilities, and the projects are still those projects. This kind of false price will eventually harm the interests of tourists, and it will also backfire on the hotel.

After check-in, whether it is the environment, service, catering, all aspects have conquered me. I arranged a butler the day before check-in. The butler Morven is a very caring brother. He will confirm various details with you and introduce hotel facilities and activities. Check-in is also accompanied all the way until it is delivered to the room. The whole hotel is made of logs, with green plants everywhere, and the rooms are also very distinctive. There are sun loungers on the balcony. Looking down from the balcony, the scenery is beautiful. You can see the whole picture of the hotel park, and you can also see Internet celebrities. Transparent swimming pool! The breakfast is highly recommended. It has a variety of varieties and tastes good. There are both Chinese and Western styles, but I love its Western style more! Those who like slow-paced and quiet travel must try this one!

msg:I received a WeChat message from the housekeeper zoe before I checked in. Thank you for your care in the past few days. The reply is timely and the service is good. Knowing that this is a "net celebrity" hotel, the guests who come to the hotel, even mothers, dress up like internet celebrities. They don't wear swimming caps or goggles when swimming, and their heads don't get wet. They only wear sunglasses and wear cool clothes. Stop to take pictures, because the hotel is really beautiful, and the arrangement of the food is obviously different from that of the public parent-child hotels, which is suitable for taking pictures. Although this smaller portion increases the workload of the staff, I think it also reduces the waste of the buffet to a certain extent. The door card is a wooden circular disk, the hangers and bathrobes are also different from ordinary hotels. The natural log decoration in the elevator makes the elevator exude a wooden aroma. The sky bar is very comfortable and the food is delicious. I have never treated it as a parent-child hotel, but on the last day of check-out, I found that the staff of the parent-child park are very nice. There is a young lady with glasses who takes the children to do handicrafts and play games. She is very dedicated. You can see that it is I really like to play with children, it’s not just perfunctory, the children like her very much, and there are many activities, such as making umbrellas for a while, and making sushi in a restaurant for a while. Because it is not the main parent-child, there are not many people participating in the children's playground and children's activities. Two staff members take three or four children to play. This ratio is much better than the situation where 30 children are active together in parent-child hotels. The cleaning of the guest room is also in place, tidy up the data cables, put a small cushion under the skin care products I brought, and fold the pajamas, which is very considerate.

I want to come again next time, and I want to stay longer when I come. Although it is not close to the seaside, it is well-decorated and pays attention to details. It is low-key and high-end, which is very in line with my aesthetics . The breakfast is rich and healthy, the outdoor lawn is designed step by step, and the famous sky swimming pool is unique among the five-star hotels in Sanya.
Some people say that this place is more suitable for girlfriends and couples, indeed, but the parent-child facilities and programs are also very thoughtful. After breakfast, friends can feed carrots to bunnies, which is the most important thing for children to experience happiness.
This time I took my daughter to experience mermaid diving, and I can only say that it is so beautiful!
The hardware of the hotel depends on each person's preferences, while the software service is where the real strength is. The housekeeper ZOE I met when I stayed in November is kind and kind, and the service is warm and patient. In the middle, I helped me book a SPA, find lost items, etc., and answered all kinds of questions in the first time, and the attitude was sincere, which increased the favorability of the check-in experience. Going on vacation, having a caring butler will really save a lot of effort

Although the location of the hotel is not close to the sea, the design, environment, service and other aspects of this hotel are all very good! In particular, the butler brother Morven was very considerate in his service. On the day of check-out, he took the initiative to ask if he needed help with late check-out. It really made me feel the service and quality that a five-star hotel should have. I will definitely choose this hotel again next time I come to Haitang Bay, thank you Brother Morven!

msg:An online celebrity hotel with the concept of environmental protection to the extreme. The green logs can be seen everywhere in the hotel. The beautiful scenery can be seen at any time. The hardware is directly pulled to the top. The service of the waiter and the hotel manager ANNE is very subtle. The manager ANNE helped to reserve the desired ones. Floor, before check-in, please contact us to ask when you will arrive at the store and if there is anything you need help with. After check-out, ANNE also stood in the position of the guest to help coordinate and solve it. The planting was successful, and I will continue to stay in the future. The price/performance ratio is also good It is very high, the panoramic view and sea view of the sea view room hotel are unobstructed, thank you ANNE again, see you next time!

msg:I strongly recommend this hotel that advocates environmental protection. It is full of green plants and full of sense of design. It is truly unique among the many magnificent resort hotels in Sanya Bay. I really like the faint woody fragrance of the hotel. The hotel is located in Haitang Bay, which is relatively less lively. The hotel is extremely private, unlike other resort hotels with crowded crowds, the open space is filled with sporadic leisure vacationers, which is very comfortable.
The one-stop butler service makes living very at ease. Special thanks to Krystal, the little butler, for his meticulous service throughout the whole process, taking care of every detail of the residence in an all-round way, and finally applied for a late check-out to enjoy the sun in the swimming pool again.
The hotel's sky swimming pool is very amazing, of course the most amazing thing is the swimming pool room, you can take a dip when you step out of the balcony~ The light and shadow in the sun make you relax and enjoy your vacation time to the fullest.
Although the hotel does not have a private beach, it is a five-minute walk across a road to the wild sandy beach, where there are few people and you can enjoy the deserted beach. The sandy beach is also very delicate, with an entire beach.
In short, it is a perfect experience, and I can't help but share it with more fat friends, it deserves to be seen by more people.

There are also some parent-child activities, such as throwing Frisbees, doing handicrafts, etc., for children to play. very happy. The swimming pool is completely transparent, and the photos are very good. Across the road is the beach of Haitang Bay. There are almost no people, so you can enjoy the whole beach to yourself. The hotel's breakfast is also very rich, both Chinese and Western styles. The service of the butler Krystal is very good and responsive. We changed hotels and the children kept talking about going back to live again😂

msg:The hotel is very new. It just opened in 2020. You can see the designer's intentions and aesthetics. This hotel really takes their concept of sustainable development to the extreme. The volcanic stone walls and a large number of plants as soon as we entered the hotel gave us a very comfortable feeling after sitting on the plane for half a day. The oncoming sea breeze blew away the heat just arrived in Sanya. The green plants that can be seen everywhere in the hotel are well maintained. Compared with the rigid and boring decoration of other old five-star hotels, the One Hotel really gave us a big surprise. The super large sky swimming pool is still not crowded with such a high occupancy rate during the New Year in Sanya. You can swim freely. The suspended design is really amazing. And the swimming pool is still constant temperature. It is no exaggeration to say that it is the hottest one among these constant temperature swimming pools in Sanya. Even if you come to play at night, it will not be very cold. The room faces the sea. When you get up in the morning, you can see the sunrise, the sea, the distant Wuzhizhou Island and the small cruise ships coming and going. The mood is really great. The hotel's breakfast is highly recommended, with rich varieties and delicious taste. I stayed in five or six hotels in Sanya this time, and the breakfast of Yi was the most satisfactory to me. When I was dining, I heard the waiter's introduction, "From farm to table" is well-deserved 👍👍I was still thinking about the hotel's breakfast after leaving the hotel. The afternoon tea was super large, and I was almost full after eating half of it. The durian cake in the shape of a goose*stone was very very very good! And we also went to the bonfire BBQ buffet. The atmosphere was particularly good when the bonfire was lit, and the dishes were also quite exquisite. BBQ seafood, Japanese food, Hainan specialties, desserts, fruits, and cocktails were all available, which changed my previous concept of hotel catering.
In particular, the hotel's service is very good. Every staff member I met in the hotel was very good. The little brother who helped to pull the luggage when he got off the car, the sister at the front desk, the waiter who helped to deliver things, the little beauty in the restaurant, and the big sister sweeping the fallen leaves in the corridor would greet with a smile. I would like to give special thanks to Morven who received me. He is a sunny guy. He added me on WeChat one day in advance and helped me arrange the room. He would always deal with any situation as soon as he was contacted. He responded very promptly. He also kindly told us to wear more clothes when we went to the sky bar, otherwise it would be windy and cold on the roof. He greeted us every day. Even after we left the hotel, he still recommended and arranged our travel plans. I was very lucky to meet Morven. I will definitely check in again in the future. See you next time!

The buffet breakfast and dinner (campfire) are all exquisite. It is considered a medium to high level in Haitang Bay. It is value for money and tasteful. I came here after listening to the word-of-mouth of several friends. The check-in was not cleaned and the two families were waiting for me at the critical moment when I was almost in a hurry. The waiter hurriedly gave another room to change and go swimming. My housekeeper Krystal was professional and enthusiastic about everything. I spent time in the sun with my husband and my family. wonderful holiday

msg:The hotel is very new, the environment is very good, the hardware facilities are good, and the catering industry is good. The flaw is that the hotel cannot directly lead to the beach. Haitang Bay has big waves. If it is the Spring Festival, it will be very cold. There is a big temperature difference between morning and evening. There are many swimming pools, but basically There is nothing to do. If you travel during the Spring Festival, you must check the weather forecast in advance. It is basically impossible to play below 25 degrees. The hotel service is very poor. There is no pick-up and drop-off. If you call at the front desk and ask for a quilt, you will be forgotten~ The hotel is very large and the design is very good. The photos are beautiful. The travel photographers brought by the hotel are very patient, but the price is not expensive. Generally speaking, the elderly with children do not recommend this hotel, but young people can recommend it. The price in the off-season is still acceptable. It is not very convenient to eat , surrounded by unfinished buildings~

The breakfast at One Hotel is absolutely perfect, exquisite, clean and rich! The noodles are delicious! The fruit will be cut into a shape of 1, like a brand image store.
The service is also very good, thanks to the little girl Zoe, the housekeeper, for answering all kinds of questions and solving our needs in a timely manner.
The hotel is also pet-friendly, bring your own dog to stay next time😁

When I entered the room, I saw a complimentary cosmetic set on the bed. It was very warm (Lion is not from this company). The epidemic has just been released During the peak season in Sanya, Morven can help me upgrade the room type, which is a surprise! The pool room with sea view is very beautiful. I asked Morven if he could check out later, and he simply answered 2:00! The a**osphere of the hotel! Later, due to an episode, I was upgraded to another level. Living here in Morven made me very at ease. There is a bathtub behind the bed in the new room, and there are lights at the bottom of the bathtub, which is very a**ospheric. The room is full of green plants, and the exterior wall of the hotel is also full of greenery. , very fresh, the bed facing the window is very comfortable. Sunshine 1 just stayed for one night with the mentality of trying it out. It was perfect.

Various objects in the room fully reflect the concept of green environmental protection in One Hotel, such as wooden room cards, "Do Not Disturb" signs made of natural stones, rewritable wooden sticky notes, beer bottle cutting Water cups, biodegradable laundry bags, paper hangers made of discarded maps, water-saving shower hourglasses, recycled cork coasters, wall decorations made of tree roots... Turning waste into treasures gave them a second life, and the hotel also received Silver certification from Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).

Staying at the Sunshine One Hotel, it was the first time I discovered that man and nature can be integrated in such a way.
The bricks and tiles of the hotel seem to be living elves, who can feel the pulse of each other's breathing.
The public area of the hotel is full of flowing water and lush greenery, which makes people feel like they have entered Alice's Wonderland, or in the Utopian Wizard of Oz.

I would also like to commend the butler Krystal, who warmly called to inquire about accommodation needs and arrival time before departure, and also upgraded to a deluxe sea view room for free. After arriving at the store, I waited outside the lobby early, and helped guide me to the room, and gave a detailed introduction to the room. After checking out, I also returned to visit enthusiastically and consulted about the experience of staying. During the whole process, I can feel the considerate service of Sunshine One Hotel, and I will choose this hotel as my first choice next time I come to Sanya.

msg:One week before the Spring Festival, I traveled to Sanya with my husband. Staying in this hotel is the most successful choice for a wonderful journey. Although I saw mixed reviews on various platforms before coming here, the experience of staying here has greatly exceeded our expectations. For the deluxe sea view room we booked, the front desk was arranged on the highest floor. The whole room is facing the sea. The happiness of lying in bed and watching the sea every day is beyond words. In addition, the hotel itself also has a great sense of design. Various restaurants, rooftop bars, lawns, and swimming pools are all self-contained, which is worth visiting and taking pictures; not to mention the rich and diverse green plants inside and outside the hotel, which makes people feel like they are in a tropical garden. The standard of the hotel's breakfast is as stated in other reviews, and the start of a good day starts in the breakfast room. But the most commendable thing is the service of the hotel. During the whole stay, I felt the enthusiasm and professionalism of the waiters, especially Sabrina who has always provided us with meticulous service. The last thing I would like to add is the fragrance and body care of the hotel. I still think about the fragrance after returning home after the journey. Sunshine One is definitely a hotel that I will recommend to all other friends who travel to Sanya.

The butler UNA presented a cocktail package in the sky bar and a swimming booster device, super fun! It's been a long time playing in the hanging pool!


Environment: I am very comfortable living in the hotel, I feel at home, without the cold feeling of ordinary hotels, the facade of the hotel is also surrounded by many plants, and the lighting is super beautiful

Hygiene: The hotel is very new, it seems that it was opened in 21 years, so everything is very clean and tidy

Service: I experienced the hotel's SPA service this time, the level is above average, and I got a good relaxation
The breakfast is not bad, I like panini and oa**eal yogurt the most
Finally, I want to complain about the front desk when I checked out. She asked me to add her WeChat account. I thought it was for the convenience of my next check-in, but it turned out that I simply asked for good reviews and asked me to mention her name. What kind of service did you provide me? ? !

msg:How should I put it, the experience is so-so. Maybe everyone has different standards and preferences. A bunch of people say how good the breakfast is. I don't have a special feeling. The almond croissant in the bread is delicious, and everything else is average. The room package comes with two cocktail packages for two, which are provided only after the housekeeper asks for it. The hotel does not take the initiative. The housekeeper service is too general and not as good as the floor attendant. Except on the day of check-in, I can’t see it in person, and the WeChat response is also slow. There is no welcome fruit and no souvenirs. The heated swimming pool is very beautiful, but half of it is a glass bottom, so if you really swim, you will be afraid of heights. The road to the beach is indeed rather deserted and in disrepair, and there is no place to wash your feet. But it is okay to provide towels, water, bags, and sunscreen before going. Let’s go to the sky bar to catch up with the cooling and strong wind that day. The airy environment on the roof is only suitable for good weather, otherwise it would be too sour to drink cocktails in a down jacket against the strong wind. You can order takeaway, there is a courier cabinet at the door, all the surrounding supermarkets can deliver goods, and it is convenient to put in the courier cabinet. There were two free-range rabbits on the lawn surrounded by a group of people, and then the rabbits were so scared that they couldn't hide, which felt a little pitiful and ridiculous. Anyway, it's a balance of merit and demerit.

Sanya 1hotel Haitang Bay Sunshine Hotel No. 4 Haitang South Road
If Sunshine One can go straight to the beach, I think Sunshine One has the potential to enter the first echelon.
In terms of design, Sunshine One, Capella, EDITION, Park Hyatt, and y HOTEL are, in my opinion, the best in Sanya hotel design.
The concept of Sunshine One is also very good. This hotel focuses on environmental protection. The hotel is surrounded by green plants with a sense of design. They do not advocate flower arrangement, and each plant is an individual that can be recycled. The birch forest in the lobby, the wooden table mats with annual rings, and even the tooth cups are all processed from wine bottles.
Then Sunshine One's swimming pool is really great. The sky pool, especially when the sun is good, is very transparent. Another place I love is SKY BAR (Sky Bar), which has an excellent view.
The room of Sunshine One is also available. The basic room is 62 square meters, which is not too small in the room of Sanya Hotel. Also new, the hotel opened in 2020.
In Sanya, where every inch of land is expensive, this hotel is very cost-effective

Environment: You can take pictures in every corner of the hotel~ There is also a constant temperature transparent swimming pool~ You can take pictures of mermaids~ The only disadvantage is that the buildings are a bit close to each other. If you want to sit and relax on the balcony, you can see clearly from the building next door ~

The breakfast is very rich, especially the small desserts 😁
In the evening, there is a bonfire tent buffet, a DJ plays BGM~the a**osphere is full, and the bartender mixes drinks according to the needs~like it~

Cocktails for two at the sky bar: The view on the top floor is really good, you can see the Ferris wheel on one side, and the hotel park after lighting up on the other (this is really beautiful), and you will get two glasses of cocktails when you stay in the hotel~Ye Yeye is very good drink~

It is especially suitable for girlfriends and couples. I would like to mention that the butler Clare is very good. When encountering things that I don't understand, my girlfriends will patiently help us with answers. There is a small regret that the capsule coffee machine in our room has a problem with the capsule breaking function, so no coffee is produced. But it didn't affect my satisfaction with Sunshine One. super recommended

The company has a good vision, which is more in line with my aesthetics. I like it very much. The most important thing is to take pictures and make special films.
     
The housekeeper, Una, is very caring. She often tells me to remember to do nucleic acid. I said that my courier is stored here because the epidemic cannot be mailed at present. Can you post it for me later? She agreed very warmly, making me feel that I have no worries and feel at ease throughout my journey. Thanks for her warm and thoughtful service

So at the end of the meeting, I have to stay for a few more days to feel deeply.

The breakfast is very rich, and every waiter is very enthusiastic!

msg:In general, suites and above are not recommended. The price of my room type is 4200 per night. It is not as good as the ordinary room type at Capella. At this price, at least Yihai Pavilion can be lived in, and the overall experience will be better. If you are a sister with a budget of more than 1,000, I recommend this hotel.

Service: The hotel is very large, and I am very satisfied with this service. And the hotel agreed for us to check out at 2 o'clock, which is very satisfactory.

Facilities: There are two bathrooms in the room, one of which has no trash can, I don't know why. The toilet is ice-cold. In a new hotel in the past three years, it is rare to see an ice-cold toilet. In fact, the overall facilities are very ordinary, without high-end texture, but the positioning of the hotel itself is not a luxury hotel, so it is acceptable.
The shower water is very small, the water of the overhead shower and the hand shower are very small.

Hygiene: There are stains in the closet. When I first entered the room, there was white garbage on the hay carpet in the living room. When I came back at night, it had been cleaned. It should have been cleaned by the turndown staff.
There is a curtain in the bathroom, and the curtain can surround the bathtub and shower at the same time, which is not inconvenient, but I am curious whether this kind of facility is really hygienic? Will the droplets and splashed water of toiletries stay on the fabric surface for a long time, won't it breed bacteria?

Service: It may be that there are not many tourists in Hainan recently, but the housekeeper Morven helped to upgrade the room, and the service was thoughtful and meticulous. Hotel customer service staff are basically young people, easy to communicate.
The hotel is located at the southern end of Haitang Bay. Although it does not have a private beach as a traditional hotel group, it is clean. There are few traditional family guests. There is no need to grab breakfast. Guests are also more concerned about the maintenance of the environment. I look forward to trying vila next time.

msg:very outrageous experience
The room could not be cleaned at 4:00 pm. The staff confirmed the arrival time one day in advance. After repeated urging, a person who claimed to be the manager called me and said that the room was out, and he also explained that he went to clean it himself.

Ask what time you can enter the room, the answer is the truth, we are very full of guests and many employees are tired
Ask at the door of the breakfast room, is this the breakfast room, and the reply is that this is the western restaurant
In another restaurant, I asked if there was a Chinese restaurant that I could order. The reply was that there was a Chinese restaurant upstairs. When we got up to leave, we said, but it was not open at noon.
The front desk said that the room includes an afternoon tea, and you can get a voucher to use it. After receiving it, I confirmed it with the front desk. The front desk said that I can go now. When I arrived at the restaurant, the waiter said that your coupon will not be available until three hours later.
I went to the restaurant and ordered a pork belly chicken hot pot. I wanted to add a seasoning. After three reminders, I replied to the back kitchen to make it. The third time I checked with the waiter. The seasoning is soy sauce. Did the back kitchen make soy sauce for dozens of minutes? ?
I asked the waiter why no one cleaned these days, and the reply was that after the 24th they changed to cleaning once every two days

The second night was my friend's birthday, and I wanted a match to light a birthday candle. The front desk said they were an environmentally friendly hotel and no smoking was allowed. I explained that it was a birthday candle, and she said to find me a lighter. After waiting for half an hour, there was nothing. Response, I called again, the waiter said that there is no lighter, I don’t understand, can you reply to the guest if there is a lighter?

I said I wanted to make a complaint, but the manager called me back. First, he called me by the wrong name, and then told me about their policy of no smoking. I said that my complaint was not that there was no lighter, but that you didn’t reply. After the complaint, this The manager said that he would send red wine/aromatherapy/afternoon tea, but I said no, and insisted on giving me a scented candle, but he didn't give me one until I left the store.
I told the manager that I didn’t want anything because I came here for fun, and I didn’t want to talk about it again the next day. The manager said he understood. As a result, a manager stood by my table at breakfast the next day and explained to me again that they were The non-smoking hotel does not provide lighters. I am very sorry. I also explained again that I am not complaining about the lack of lighters, but that there is no response to the complaint.

I came here to apologize, but I don’t know why I apologize. Every waiter seems polite, but I can feel the perfunctory under their masks.

In general, it’s all trivial things, but in a hotel that doesn’t have its own beach, no water recreation facilities, and focuses on design and service, such services are not worth it

Diet: Although there are not many varieties of food, the taste is very good. I went to the hotel’s Green House Restaurant for lunch at noon. That said, it all tastes good! It can be said that it is the hotel with the best food and beverage taste among the several hotels I stayed in this time.
Service: We are the housekeeper Krystal, who is very enthusiastic and responsive. We added WeChat two days before check-in to inquire about the check-in needs. Unlike some hotels, we can only add the housekeeper WeChat on site.
It is worth mentioning that the quality of the toiletries in this hotel is very good! The softest toothbrush I have ever used, better than those used in 2-3 thousand hotels

The entire hotel focuses on environmental protection, even the room cards are small wooden cards, and the disposable items in the room are also mainly made of wood. It is commendable that Anne, the hotel housekeeper, added WeChat the day before check-in, arranged everything for us in every detail, and greeted us to upgrade the room type early, which was not available in other hotels before. It's a pity that this time there was a small outbreak, we had to leave, and we didn't have a good time to visit the hotel. Next time we go to Sanya, we must savor it carefully again!

msg:After coming to Sanya to take the students to class, the eldest apprentice came to play with us, so she went to Sunshine One to live for two days before she left. As a free diving club, of course, we also came to check in this time to take pictures of mermaids in the Internet celebrity floating swimming pool. I heard that there is the largest floating transparent swimming pool in the Asia-Pacific region, with a total area of 1200 square meters. In fact, since 2020, I have wanted to experience #SanyaSunshineOneHotel[topic]#, because the concept of environmental protection is the main concept here, which coincides with the concept of divers who love nature and the sea.
🪵The decoration items of the hotel are basically made of wood and rattan. In order to reduce the generation of plastic products, the door card is made into a round cute wooden sign with a chip.
🪨The design materials for the exterior wall of the hotel include abandoned ship wood and rail sleepers from the seaside of Sanya, volcanic rocks from Haikou, and blue bricks and black tiles of old houses transported from Hubei. In order to reduce ecological pollution, decorations made from recycled waste such as iron sheets and tree stumps can be seen everywhere when walking in the hotel.
🍃The water supply system in the lobby wall continues to support the growth of green plants on the wall, making people feel like they are in a tropical rain forest.
♻️The cups used in the room are all made of recycled old wine bottles after secondary cutting, the toothbrush handle in the bathroom is pure wood, and other disposable items are also intimately reminding the guests to use their imagination to give these disposables Supplies have a second life, thereby reducing the use of single-use items.
This is the first Sunshine One Hotel in China by the founder of W Hotel, and there are only five in the world. It may not be regarded as a traditional five-star resort hotel for many people, but it is completely in line with my view of vacation. All kinds of needs, many small details full of design sense and extraordinary significance continue to surprise us. Sitting at the sky bar on the 9th floor at night blowing the sea breeze seems to be in Bangkok's midnight lounge, standing on the balcony during the day or in the floating swimming pool. Looking at the blue sea, tension and anxiety can be released one by one.
💰 In November, all major hotels in Sanya are on special prices. The usual basic room rate is now directly in the boutique sea view room. The recent price is in the early 1000s, including double breakfast.

Although I have not been able to come due to various reasons before, this time I think it is the best arrangement. Our family spent two days that were unforgettable and pleasant. For me, leisure can be regarded as a good holiday experience, and quietness must be a necessary prerequisite. During the off-season, the number of people in the public areas of the hotel is basically less than ten. Due to the small number of guests, the service quality has also been greatly improved, allowing our whole family to get a very attentive service experience. The three outdoor swimming pools of different depths meet the needs of everyone in our family. The breakfast is also rich and exquisite, which is very popular in my heart. My favorite is the bathrobes in the room with novel design but super practical and easy to wear. Go downstairs to the lobby You can even buy the same model to take home. When we left, the staff also gave us a straw hat in the store as a souvenir, which was really thoughtful.
❤️Overall we are very satisfied and looking forward to our next stay! If you also want to come to Sanya, come here and give yourself a vacation!

From hotel planning to public area design, we adapt to local conditions without losing local characteristics. Every detail comes from nature and blends into nature. The room design is also very warm, the sea view room you choose, you can quietly enjoy the beautiful sea view while lying on the bed. The breakfast is also good. The sky bar has a Southern California style. The overall experience is very worthwhile. The level of the travel photographers sent needs to be improved.

Environment: The external environment is very beautiful. I saw that the staff was serious about disinfecting and killing. The inside of the room is not bad, but it is a little small. But after staying for so many days, once I pressed the cleaning button but my aunt did not clean it. Later, I contacted the housekeeper zoe.
The room is small as a whole. After opening the suitcase, it feels like the room is full. Since it is set by the resort hotel, the room should be larger and the price is still there. The bathtub is still very nice.
The hotel is not close to the sea, but has a sea view but is separated by a protective forest, which is difficult to pass. The hotels on the other side seem to be fine, but I don't know about Quanha, and there are treasures who have asked Linhai to pay attention!
Service: My housekeeper is zoe~ The service is very good, I feel that I am online 24 hours a day, and I am responsive to my needs~ I also sent fruit for several days, and I also sent ginger tea for fear of catching a cold. The other butler was also good, I forgot what it was called, the service was very good, and there was a phone call before check in. Nucleic acid situation will be reminded in time.
I originally booked several room types. When we went there, the sun room had not been repaired. The hotel upgraded it to a sea view room. Looking at the sun room, it seemed to be more spacious. Fine~ I can’t visit it~

Special thanks to our personal butler, Morven, for his professional, thoughtful and thoughtful arrangements, which added a lot of beautiful moments to our stay at Sunshine One. The favorable impression of Sunshine Yi directly increased to 100 points. No regrets at all.
First of all, Morven helped us choose the high-rise sea view room with the best view, and arranged a very ceremonial welcome arrangement for the room.
Secondly, he was very patient to show us around and introduce the whole hotel. All public areas are decorated with environmental awareness, such as the green plants on the wall with its own water circulation system, the decorative wall with stacked rock blocks with Hainan characteristics, etc. I really like the concept of Sunshine One! This is the only one in the whole country. Anyone who comes to Sanya and doesn't live in Sunshine once will be sad.
Morven also arranged for us breakfast at the hotel, fruit platter for afternoon tea, a healing course with a sound bowl (although it was not successful), and water play items such as underwater propellers, which really couldn't be more intimate. Thank you Morven, if you come to Sunshine One, you must appoint Morven to receive or book a room! He is very good at communication, and is also a very gentleman and handsome little brother.
Finally, put a few random photos and a video of the most important mermaid this time. We will be back!
Last but not least, the hotel's breakfast was great! Healthy, delicious and beautiful, it meets all your requirements for a perfect meal, balanced and complete nutrition, and many fruits and vegetables are grown by themselves.

msg:a natural retreat lush, refreshing and inspiring. This eco-themed hotel shattered my understanding of traditional leisure vacations. The details that can be seen everywhere in the hotel reflect the intentions of the founder team, and the high-quality services of all depar**ents also feel the intentions of this young hotel management team and service team. As a parent-child hotel that is not on the list, there are not many children, but thanks to all the staff of Xiaozimiao seedlings, it is your serious, friendly and responsible attitude and hard work that make the children fall in love with this hotel and stay twice, let the children fall in love with this hotel. Parents can rest assured for a while. Baking is delicious and good looking, the water activities are fun and the kids club is newer. I hope that the small seedling activities will continue to be enriched. We have to thank the on-duty managers Li and He for the two renewals. The first renewal was very late, but Manager Li helped us with special trea**ent to eliminate our fatigue and anxiety. Under the special arrangement of Manager He and the friendly assistance of Xiao Sun at the front desk, we were pleasantly surprised to upgrade the sea view room during the peak season! And I was overjoyed to enjoy the coconut hot pot and authentic Western food in the western restaurant, as well as the unforgettable food in the Chinese restaurant! The children saw the Chinese restaurant Green House, which was made of straw rope and said that it was a little handmade and very creative. Thank you to all the restaurant staff for their friendly and courteous service. The net red swimming pool is very beautiful! Special praise for the mermaid coach here, the children like her very much! Travel photographer Ajie is very patient with children's humor and takes good pictures! The overall feeling is that in addition to the unskilled attitude of the two front desks in the lobby on the first day of check-in, the surprises are still constant. After all, the front desk lobby is the facade where the first impression is very important. Thank you Hu Chi Xiaowang for helping the children find their lost items. The concierge doorman service is also on call and timely and thoughtful. Post pictures of the details of the room and the beauty of every turn of the sky bar. The theme of environmental protection is reflected everywhere. Wooden toiletries, paper bags and paper boxes without plastic, organic cotton bathrobes and slippers, and even restaurant hand towels are all natural flavors. . It is thought-provoking for people to live in harmony with nature, protect the environment, save marine life such as sea turtles, reduce plastic, and more…

! ! ! There were blood stains and a peculiar smell on the quilt, so there was a high probability that it had not been changed.
1. Guests need to go to the front desk to pick up the fruit delivered by themselves, and they will not inform you when they check in;
2. There is no trash can in the bathroom of the hotel room, and there are only three sheets of paper left;
3. The price of the restaurant is higher than five-star, the service is lower than one-star and does not support food delivery;
4. The laughter in the corridor can be clearly heard in the room, I don’t know it is **;
5. The hot water only needs to be left for a minute, and the water pressure is pitifully low
Really, why, rely on this rough and foolish design sense?

The bath water was very small and it took a long time for hot water to come out. I slept late the night before and wanted to sleep a little longer in the morning, but the upstairs was tapping, knocking, and drilling after 9 o'clock. I didn't know which construction site I lived in! ! It's really annoying. It took 20 minutes to solve the problem after contacting the housekeeper. It's a big blow to people who don't sleep well! Moreover, there are construction sites around, and there is no beach in the hotel. When you open the balcony curtains, you can see the guests on the opposite side. The privacy is not good, and the booking on Ctrip can't be refunded~ In short, I won't come again

msg:Stayed for 6 days, very satisfied, the software and hardware are of high quality, exquisite and fashionable, and sleep is very comfortable. I used to live in Yalong Bay, but the hotels there are relatively old. In contrast, we prefer this Sunshine One. Although there is no private beach here, it is possible to reach the beach by walking through a forest, and it feels more natural with fewer people. It is very comfortable to stay in the hotel, and every detail can stand up to nitpicking. For example, the towels are new and clean. When you get up in the middle of the night and go to the bathroom floor and sliding door, there will be no noise to disturb your family. There are pillows and buckwheat pillows to choose from. Originally we were afraid of air-conditioning, but the air-conditioning wind in the room here is acceptable. The quality of the breakfast is in line with the five-star level, and there are freshly squeezed juices. The key is that the service attitude is very good. I can always see that their managers are busy, and they will take the initiative to ask us what we need. Even tourism projects can give suggestions. In short, you can feel that this hotel has systematic training and management, and its philosophy is to satisfy guests. We suggested that the shower room smelled bad, so we immediately came to change the floor drain, and upgraded the room the next day. By the way, the main difference between the rooms here is the floor and the orientation. The selected sea view queen room is above the 8th floor and the balcony is facing the seaside. Other room types are facing the swimming pool, and the sea view can only be seen sideways. Our children like the transparent swimming pool very much. After soaking in the pool all morning, the skin is sunburned. We need to pay attention. It is better to go in the evening. There are also some good books in the room.

If you stay in Sanya for more days, you can choose to buy things and live here. However, I feel less eating here. Western-style food is not so delicious. BBQ only has set menus. There is no single person. There is no Hainan cuisine. I think I care too much about eating it. The breakfast is also rich. Little, there's a mojito made with cactus juice. It's special.

I didn't start to check in until a similar manager informed the front desk staff. I asked the hotel front desk if there was a beach. The front desk staff told me that I didn't know. I asked the housekeeper , all the hotel staff will not take the initiative to say hello to the guests when they see the guests. There is no enthusiasm. The hotel pool staff will not take the initiative to take bath towels for the guests who come ashore. They just stand there like sculptures, which is the most incomprehensible The most important thing is that the sky bar of the node hotel was closed on Chris**as Eve. No one notified in advance. It was the worst experience I had staying in a hotel in Sanya! There is no trash can in the toilet of the hotel. After taking a shower in the shower room, you have to go around the cloakroom to get the bath towels. Moreover, the hotel passage is very narrow. Every time you encounter a cleaning car at the door, you can’t pass through. It’s very sad in terms of service and details

msg:I came to stay once during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday~ I used to stay in a hotel near the duty-free. For the first time, I had a small attempt on Haitang South Road.

Advantages: 1. The hotel is relatively new in the Haitang Bay hotel group, and all kinds of facilities are relatively complete. There is no pressure to charge new energy vehicles, and there is an underground parking lot~
2. The decoration style of the room and the small garden downstairs are very suitable for taking pictures. I like the style of the room decoration.
3. The hotel breakfast is very recommended. After the epidemic, it is difficult to find this level of breakfast. It is really worth the money. I like the latte very much~ The freshly squeezed juice is also full of sincerity~
4. The staff of the hotel are very considerate in all aspects, including the housekeeper Allen who contacted the day before, and will take the initiative to ask if you need to go to the airport to pick up the plane and check out.
There is also a little improvement that is expected, such as there is no trash can in the washing area of the room, less paper is drawn, and the layout of the sun room is a little bit incomprehensible, but overall it is still relatively cost-effective.
Summary: For everyone who comes by car, the hotel is very recommended. It may be a little troublesome without a car.
The facilities of the hotel are very complete, and the staff are very considerate. Although the backyard is smaller than that of the old hotels, it has achieved a relatively high cost performance in a limited space.
In addition: there is still construction near the hotel but it does not affect the rest. If you mind, you can take a look at the hotel groups near the duty-free

Our room was upgraded to face the sea! Absolutely! ! ! I woke up naturally in the morning and just wanted to open the curtains to watch the sunrise, when I heard the young lady upstairs exclaim: Ah! What a nice view! ! ! (EM I think so too hahahahaha is really good !!!)

🔔Service: My contact person is the beautiful young lady yarra, but there are actually many friendly and active little brothers who solve problems and give us small gifts! Smooth communication, warm and lovely!

🍰Breakfast: Freshly squeezed juice, free mix of noodles/flour, baked snacks, all are ok!

I haven't experienced the pool yet, it's too hot and lazy, but it looks good hehe!

I hope that the service can be guaranteed during the holidays, and the price is not too high due to hype and other premiums. Do not forget the original intention (do you have a record of old customers, you can treat new and old customers friendly, so that there are 66 repeat customers!)

Alright, ZzCP comment is over😉😙

I didn't expect to surprise me when I arrived. The hotel as a whole is environmentally friendly log style, all kinds of decoration details are very good, to upgrade the sea view room. In order to comply with the epidemic prevention requirements, except for nucleic acid not leaving the house during the 3-day 2-check period, the hotel's Olivia added WeChat when communicating in advance, and sent us the hotel's menu and breakfast during the stay at the hotel. In this way, the buffet breakfast became a room. I didn't expect the breakfast to be so good. During this period, Olivia helped us communicate with express delivery to the door of the room, replenish water and coffee capsules, and all the details. The service is really in place! Will definitely come back to Hotel 1 next time!

msg:Let's just say it's one of the best hotels I've ever seen that really carry through to the service the hotel was originally designed with. Because a few of our friends just stayed at Yalong Bay Marriott for a few days and wanted to try another hotel, we chose Sunshine One. I heard that there are five in the world, and Asia is only in Haitang Bay. The theme is environmental protection. After staying for three nights, the overall simple, fresh and clean appearance of the waiters is as deeply imprinted in my mind as the concept of environmental protection ♻️ that this hotel has always run through, and every corner of the hotel is full of details. One morning when I went to exercise, I couldn't have breakfast in time. The waiter at the restaurant on the first floor asked my friend, "Why didn't Mr. Liu come down for breakfast with you?" My friend told him that I was exercising, so the waiter Qingqing helped me I packed breakfast. Thanks again Qingqing, hope you can see it 😄. Another time, in the morning, I went to the coffee shop opposite the lobby on the third floor to process some documents, because a friend I was traveling with had a Marriott ambassador card. In order to experience this place, we booked the cheapest room together. I wanted to go to the hotel in the morning. He upgraded a suite, and Grace at the front desk directly helped us upgrade a suite for free. I would like to thank Grace again. I will go to this hotel next time I take my friends. Thank you 👍

msg:Sunshine One, the youngest five-star hotel in Sanya. It is said that the hotel lives in the new and not the old, but this sentence actually makes sense. Domestic hotels are a watershed in about one or five years. Most of the hotels opened before are veterans, and the later ones cater to the tastes of young people. The founder of Sunshine One is the ceo of the former spg. Sunshine One focuses on green environmental protection themes. I like it anyway. The warm yellow light and logs give a very warm feeling of home, and the ubiquitous green plants often make you see Bright. Several corners of the long corridor will also be decorated with some green plants, which make people feel instantly bright. The overall area of the hotel is not large, but every design will feel novel, which is a feeling that other stores can't give you. When I lived in Addison a few days ago, I felt high and cold, and the overall feeling here is warm. In contrast, my wife and I prefer a warm and homely feeling. And it's two-thirds cheaper than the Edison here, and the price/performance ratio is also good. To sum up the characteristics of Sunshine One in one sentence, it is the harmony and unity of the building and the environment. Although it is in the building, it seems to be in the forest. As for the statement that the sun does not depend on the sea, it is not entirely correct. From the ground, it is indeed separated from the sea by a road, but in terms of actual distance, the distance from the sea is not farther than that of Haitang Bay, and it even feels closer. Other hotels in Haitang Bay are also a long distance from the sea, and there are also many windbreaks. Haitang Bay has large waves and undercurrents, so it is not allowed to enter the water. In fact, it is enough to watch the sea from the hotel. If you are swimming, there is also a net red glass suspended swimming pool, which is also the biggest highlight of the hotel. In particular, I would like to commend Harrison, the duty manager. Seeing that I was very hospitable when taking pictures, I took the initiative to introduce the hotel's Internet celebrity check-in points, and also helped us send us small gifts such as fruit plates. In the middle of the night, I was responsive to all requests, and the service was quite in place and thoughtful, which made me a little flattered. . The sky is blue and the water is green in Sanya, the sunshine is warm and warm, and I will stay here next time I come to Sanya

The design is unique, and the building itself, the garden, and the swimming pool are all unique and worthy of careful consideration. It has been raining during our stay, or will there be more films. The restaurant focuses on Western-style light meals, which are more authentic, but not everyone likes it. Hainanese chicken rice is amazing, but the price is not low. Overall a great hotel, worth the experience.

Facing the sea, the sea breeze does not feel hot at 30 degrees. The breakfast is not rich, but the presentation is exquisite and the lighting is very appetizing. Let's talk about the service of the hotel again. The lady at the front desk, Iris, is very enthusiastic. There is also a small gift of 520. She answers questions in a timely manner. Even if she is on vacation, she can still help with questions. The waiter who cleans the room is also very nice and cleans twice a day. , will also help to leave a small note of thought, or a little surprise. The only downside is that the surrounding area is relatively deserted, the beach facing it has not been well developed, and some areas of the hotel are temporarily closed.

On the second day of the new year, I went to Haitang Bay, Sanya, just to stay at the new Internet celebrity hotel Sunshine One! Arrived at the hotel at ten o'clock in the morning, the lady at the front desk was very helpful and helped me check in early, very happy!
☀️ Sunshine One Hotel is affiliated to SH Hotel Group in the United States and is the first designer hotel in the Asia-Pacific region by 1 hotels. The hotel focuses on the concept of environmental protection and has a great sense of design. Many items are made of environmentally friendly and recycled materials. The whole hotel exudes a very light woody fragrance.
☀️ The most striking feature of the hotel is the 1400-square-meter, 55-meter-long acrylic transparent heated swimming pool! Overlooking the sea and reflecting the blue sky, it is like being in the air!
☀️ The sky bar on the ninth floor is worth a visit, buy a two-person package and have two hours of unlimited drinks!
☀️ During the Spring Festival, house prices... have risen a lot! It is recommended that you come here on a regular basis, and the price is better!
☀️ The hotel's dining is very convenient. There are many restaurants, and it is also suitable for parents and children to live. There are children's theaters and amu*****t facilities.
​☀️ From 68 Food Street, eight minutes by taxi, there is a seafood processing market and various restaurants! The straight-line distance to Houhai Village is more than five kilometers, and the transportation is convenient!

msg:To be honest, Sunshine Yichao is in line with my values. I am an environmentalist and every detail here confirms that the hotel is in harmony with nature. All the furniture is wooden and exudes a fragrance of logs. The straw is used instead of the fur carpet. There are a lot of plants and the green coverage of the hotel is also very high. Even the room card is replaced by wood instead of traditional plastic. Toothbrush and bathrobes really love the feeling of a sweater
Of course, there are also problems. The shower room in Room 747 always smells like a backflow from the sewer when I take a shower, and it's a little bit down. At first, the water won't go down, and the room even gets wet. Fortunately, it's solved later.
Then the breakfast is not very satisfactory... The fruit is very difficult to eat and a bit inconsistent with the value
But next time I come to Sanya, I will stay here

Sitting on the terrace for breakfast is like camping. I like it too much. The hotel’s spa was a bit expensive at first, but I got a 200 yuan voucher for my stay. In the end, I was very satisfied with the full body deep massage. The massage therapist Ruby's techniques were particularly in place, and he strengthened the massage for the key shoulder and neck positions. After finishing it, I felt that the cervical spine and shoulders were completely relaxed. It was very comfortable and the breakfast was also very rich. It’s delicious, and the travel shots included in the package are also good. I’m not used to posing. The photographer still tried to adjust the shooting ideas and took good works. Although there are also sales promotion, they are not too frequent and within the acceptable range. Shortcomings The service needs to be improved. One of the benefits of staying in duty-free shops needs to be applied for one day in advance, and the shuttle bus should also be booked one day in advance. As a result, when you want to go, you can’t use it if you don’t have a reservation. More, but since it is promoted as a welfare, I should at least give it a hint.

After talking about the advantages, the next thing is the place where people collapse! We booked three rooms, five and one, and arrived at the hotel after twelve o'clock. The front desk gave the room number, but because it has not been cleaned, we can't check in temporarily, so we waited patiently in the lobby to check in. When it was almost three o'clock, because we had children, after we explained the situation and urged us twice, we were given a room after three o'clock, and then the remaining three adults began to wait for a long time! We got the room card for the second room at 4 o'clock, and at 6 o'clock, the room card for the third room was not delivered, nor did we receive any text messages from the hotel. We couldn't bear it anymore. I only got the third room card, so long for such a long stay, halo!

However, there are still some small flaws in the design of the hotel and areas that need to be improved: 1. It is great to have a free coffee machine, but the coffee cup is too big to pick up coffee. 2. The design of the bedside table is too low, it is very inconvenient to lie on the bed to take things. 3. It is recommended to add some mosquito repellents or mosquito coils. There are still mosquitoes sneaking in from the balcony at night!

3. Green plants in the room. This is the hotel with the most green plants in the hotel I have stayed in, and the air feels very good.
4. Beautiful night scene
5. Good air
6. Children have fun at the playground
7. I arranged a spa for my mother, and she felt very comfortable too


a fly in the oin**ent:
No soap in room for laundry

However, the relevant officials have adopted the opinion.
After all, everything has a good and a bad side.

msg:The experience of staying at Sunshine One Hotel Sanya shares three points: 1) The environment, fashion sense, you can travel and take photos for a few hours at the hotel. Every corner of the hotel is a scenic spot. We stayed in the family swimming pool suite. The huge private swimming pool is endless joy. 2) Service: Our family suite is equipped with a housekeeper. This time, a little boy named Morven is very attentive and patient. Generally, any additional room service needs we have will be solved in time. Knowing that he has just joined the company for more than a month, he feels very experienced. He has done a good job and needs special praise and encouragement; 3) Catering, I think the food in general hotels is expensive, and the selling environment is not particularly attractive to me this time. The Green House Restaurant and the Farmhouse Restaurant are highly recommended. The taste is really good and the price is very reasonable

Parents can basically stay out of sight and feel at home on the balcony of the room. The seventh and ninth floors are suitable for couples to travel. The scenery is good. I like it very much The mirror in the room is a clean balcony. Lying on the sofa. It's very pleasant. Hahahaha must emphasize a little hotel service a few times to replace the room.

The service staff are proactive, patient, warm, and attentive. The hotel is separated from the seaside all the way, although it is impossible to walk through, but you can see the sea in the room, and you can enjoy the sea view from the balcony, making a large-scale effect. The hotel's transparent swimming pool can be described in one word: stunning! The long swimming pool is "suspended" in the air, which really has an infinite effect, hehe. The hotel's gym is small in size and has new facilities, including treadmills, elliptical machines, exercise bikes and other equipment. Boys can also come here to lift weights. The activity area has a ping pong table, projectors and motion game consoles. There is only one western restaurant and Chinese restaurant for dinner in the hotel. The Chinese restaurant is of good quality and service, but the price is a little expensive. The overall feeling is very satisfactory, it is a very pleasant holiday experience, and I give praise to the hotel staff.

We also liked that the hotel design revolved around the theme of "environmental protection". The buffet selection is rich and delicious, especially the Chris**as dinner and rooftop afternoon tea. The hotel is very close to Houhai Village, which is convenient if you want to go surfing or go to a bar. We also received a small gift from the hotel when we left the hotel.

Room: This time we stayed in the parent-child room haha. Actually, we came here with three girls. After consulting the hotel about the extra bed in the room, we decided that the parent-child room is more comfortable overall. The sofa bed in the room is also very large and comfortable, and we all enjoyed our stay.
Meal: The breakfast in the hotel is very delicious, and the waiter ordered a latte and it was delivered, and the buffet breakfast even had egg Benedict, which was also very good!
The cocktails at the sky bar on the top floor are all good. This one with strawberries is quite refreshing and delicious. There is a two-hour all-you-can-drink package that is very cost-effective, you can ask the waiter and they will tell you how to order.
Facilities: The net celebrity heated swimming pool is the happiest thing to come to Sanya in winter. You don’t need to adapt to the water at all, and you can take a few pictures with the unicorn bubble shape, which is so beautiful! The sun is good this time, and I have a wheat muscle in two hours. Hahaha. Remember to sunscreen!
Service: We pulled down the DJI camera! ! ! Fortunately, I found and contacted us when the hotel room was cleaned up. We didn't even find it hahaha. I was very careful with me and sent the information to us. Like it!

Not to mention the hotel environment, the designer advocates the concept of environmental protection, so it is worth learning that environmental protection elements can be seen everywhere!

In the evening, you must go to the sky bar. Mojito happens to have activities. 2 cups only cost 50. You can also relax by looking at the night view! When I returned to the room, I found that the waiter helped to remove the slippers and put them next to the bed (because we were in a hurry to go out and didn’t stay in the room). The non-heated swimming pool was a bit cold in November. The hotel also gave a variety of small gifts during the period. The mascot was small. Sheep, Biotherm suit, handmade necklace and coconut cookies! The design of the hotel is also very detailed, and you can publish online celebrity photos in any place!

Will definitely come again next time! ! ! love it! ! !

shortcoming:
(1) There is no beach in the hotel, there is a road from the sea, and there are construction sites next to it, which is messy and noisy.
(2) The hotel still cooperates with Mercedes-Benz. There is an adverti*****t of Mercedes-Benz at the door. There is also a Mercedes-Benz car displayed in the hotel. It is very strange.
(3) The room facilities can only be said to be a homestay. The bathtubs are all made of cement. They are still small, and the sight line is even more strange. Look at the pictures.
(4) The sound insulation is poor, and the sound of the rooftop bar upstairs can be heard directly in the room at night.
This hotel is worth up to 800 yuan ... not difficult any more

msg:It was my first time to complain about a hotel in Sanya. I just called to ask if the sun room could see the sea. The front desk replied yes. The sun room was decorated very special, so I booked it for three days and tried my luck. Arrived at the hotel at 5 pm, there was no welcome, and there was only a security guard. This was the first time I encountered this situation in a Sanya hotel, and then I took my luggage to check in. The front desk was very cold, everything was environmentally friendly, and there was almost no work. personnel. The room passes through the smelly restaurant, and arrives at the room with the desolation in front of you. The hotel has no sea at all, and it is some distance from the sea, and there should be some distance to see the sea. The hotel was very noisy in the morning, and the construction team next door was starting work early in the morning. It was impossible to take a vacation. So I got up early to have breakfast. Breakfast was okay. There were a lot of desserts, but I felt like a beggar begging because some varieties were closed. In the glass cabinet, you need to ask for two slices of ham at a time, such as smoked salmon, such as beef slices. This is the first time I met the hotel in Sanya so environmentally friendly. Stayed for three days and ate breakfast and never went again. Breakfast ended at 10:30. The hotel service staff is extremely short of training, and the welcoming staff is present intermittently, or they play with mobile phones. On the day of leaving the hotel, the front desk called and said that there is a small gift to give a conch pendant and a cup, why can’t you learn about the Ritz-Carlton guests when they check in and give them to the guests directly, as a five-star resort hotel welcome There is no lack of enthusiasm, because your prices are not cheap, you can environmentally friendly toothbrush supplies, and the service staff cannot be too environmentally friendly. A five-star hotel was built like a high-end version of the whole season, and I was very disappointed. I bought a set of afternoon tea. The front desk clerk told me that it was on the 9th floor. I ran down to the 9th floor and asked about it, saying that it was on the first floor, regardless of the convenience of the guests. , The waiter said that the original variety is gone, I only bought it for one day, and there is no way. Can't you tell in advance? Can't the waiter tell the customer where the afternoon tea is? And make an appoin**ent for dinner two hours in advance. Anyway, I stepped on thunder. I wanted to live in a newly opened experience, but I was very unhappy. The price is really not worth more than 1,600 rooms that really can't compete with hotels of the same grade. Objectively speaking, the only advantage of the hotel is that the cleaning staff is very careful and attentive. An environmentally friendly hotel, everything is environmentally friendly.

The restaurants are also very good, the outdoor starry sky bar experience forgot to take pictures and the prices of drinks are quite affordable.
Friends who like to have a drink can go.
However, the music part of the night was too popular and did not match the hotel. I hope I can have a better experience in this section in the future.
Remember to swim in the pool with your room card and you need to swipe the access control, because it is a temporary decision to come to Sanya without a swimsuit and wear quick-drying suits and swimming trunks to enter the water (you must not learn from me) The swimming pool is great and clean. Enjoy it!
Here is a small reminder that the hotel does not have a private beach, so if you mind this, don't choose.
Also, the bathtub in the hotel room type is designed at the head of the bed, so friends who may have requirements for bathtubs and those who don't like compact layout should pay attention to it.

🔔Service: I made a total of 4 calls from booking to check-in. The first time I was worried that I could not check in early before I arrived at the store (it is recommended that you check in after 12 noon) because of the hangover, and I was in my friend’s room. After waiting, the bag was stored in the concierge, and I forgot to take the charging line and called to send the line. After check-in, the honey water was sent again (really embarrassing), but every staff member is very serious and responsible!
Especially when I first checked in, because I went to Guangzhou Sunac ski itinerary last week, I got an asterisk and I didn't feel unpleasant or felt different trea**ent.
Provided the green code itinerary card and nucleic acid report and signed the letter of commi**ent, it will be processed normally ❤️
It may be the first time I stayed or because I heard that I was uncomfortable, the hotel specially presented a cup and a necklace with a 1 hotel logo, no matter what, thank you very much🙏
I would recommend it again to friends who like this style!

The hotel has a beautiful environment, and the decoration style is really loved. It feels similar to the Addison, but the price is half discount, which is very cost-effective. The public areas and rooms are beautiful, especially the rooms, which are amazing and I love them.

msg:It is a very edge and design hotel! The style is different from that of most resort hotels in Haitang Bay. The hotel's environmentalism concept is everywhere, and the scenery is everywhere. The breakfast category is abundant, especially the fresh panini gives people a great sense of happiness, and the way of visiting and displaying fruits is also quite beautiful.

The only thing to say is that this is a new hotel. Small trees are not yet in full bloom. Compared with the surrounding resort hotels with private beaches, it looks more like an oasis in the desert. The playability in the hotel is not too big except for the very popular infinity pool. Due consideration. It is more suitable for young couples to travel! (Although the baby yellow duck bathrobe in the hotel’s parent-child room is very cute!)

msg:Hotels where you can bring dogs! However, there is a cleaning fee every night, remember to confirm with the hotel in advance. Because I have two dogs, the cleaning fee is bleeding heavily. I negotiated with the hotel to upgrade the room type for me. Finally, I got my wish and changed to the room type I wanted~ I highly recommend this room by the pool. The terrace can go directly to the pool. The room is also very big.
The dog service is well done. The doghouse and dog bowl are prepared when I go, and the doghouse and dog bowl are cleaned every day😂
The prepared kennel feels more advanced than the one I bought at home. The dog likes it very much. After I get home, I will buy him a high-quality kennel. It looks expensive and really sleeps more comfortably.
The hotel service is very good. Chase, the housekeeper throughout the process, will answer all questions. Because I brought the dog, I ran into the Zhejiang epidemic within a few days of the trip. He even checked the epidemic prevention policy for me and was very patient.
Xiao Li from the housekeeping depar**ent is also very good and gave me an extra set of small gifts.
The hotel is very new, the service is good, and the breakfast is delicious. I have stayed at the One Hotel in Miami before, and I was shocked. The rooms are very small, except for the beautiful public spaces such as the lobby and the top floor, and the rooms themselves are terrible. But the room in Sanya is very comfortable and clean. The style is very similar to Edison, but the price is half cheaper.
Next time I will continue to choose Sunshine One, mainly this pool room, which has won my heart! That is, the pet cleaning fee is indeed quite high, and it is collected every day, heartache 😭

My favorite is Sunshine One Hotel~ My very happy husband can choose this treasure hotel. The hotel style features, dining activities, and service standards are perfect!
We chose the sun room, the eiderdown was so warm that I didn't want to get up, drinking red wine and soaking in the rose bath, it was more comfortable. Slippers and bathrobes in the hotel are super comfortable ~ favorite is the characteristic swimming pool and garden scenery, add a booster to become a mermaid in seconds, not the most fun, only more fun. I have to boast about the hotel’s breakfast. The key to the variety is that it’s very exquisite.
Not to mention the service of the hotel. Ms. Manos was patient and attentive throughout the whole process. The service attitude was super good and responsive. I really like it here. Recommend to everyone to come and check in. If you come to Sanya next time you want to take your parents to enjoy it.

It is a designer hotel. In addition to the Internet celebrity skyline pool, other public areas are also very beautiful. Although it is not facing the beach, it still has a full sense of vacation. The breakfast also won my heart. The cold meal included sliced ham & smoked salmon, freshly made panini and sandwiches, and finally ice cream.

msg:1: The signal of the room on the 7th floor is very, very poor! Wechat can’t even get out of Moments. Hotels have Wi-Fi, but not everyone dares to use Wi-Fi. Different tasks should take into account the security of wireless networks!

2: There is a construction site next to the hotel and it has not been completely completed. Pushing the door out is a view of the construction site, and the experience is very poor

3: The overall environment of the built part is okay, the rooms are clean, and the attitude of the service staff is also very good, but it is not worth the price. It can be better if you add a little money, and the cheaper one will not be much worse than this one. , The price/performance ratio is not high, of course, if you have money and just want to experience life, please ignore this

4: The hotel should be positioned as a mid-to-high-end design hotel, but the design and many things inside are really poor in detail. You can even see the wires in their logo light box. Those who pursue design experience can go to the next one, that The design will not disappoint you (the price is higher but not much higher), and their indoor bathtub design is very weird. Behind the sink, if two people live, they will watch you take a bath when they wash their hands. You can see Figure, the root of design is to facilitate humans, rather than design for design, this design concept is very bad.

5: The minibar is chargeable. If you charge a fee, don’t put things in. You can set up and sell at the front desk. It is normal to put things on sale, but when you check in, the staff will specially emphasize your mini bar when you pay for it. Charges, but this repeatedly emphasizes how much the mini bar in the room you live in has a very bad experience! Originally, the room is just to relax. I drink a bottle of water and I have to think about how much it is charged. The experience was very ridiculous. I checked out today and saw a small couple of college students next to check in. When I heard the front desk say the minibar, I felt very embarrassed. (Everyone should understand when they are dating in college)

6: When I made the reservation, I saw that it was delayed until 2 o'clock. I don't know why the hotel didn't know. I called to check out just a few minutes after 12 o'clock, and then said that there are not many people in the hotel, so I can delay it to 2 o'clock... In fact, I decided to confirm it before, maybe they really didn’t receive the news, but they rushed to the people as soon as 12 o’clock. Although they were very polite, they gave you the feeling that the delay was to give you alms, and the good mood just got up was bad for a moment. ...

7: There are good and bad. I am also a very old user of Ctrip. I have stayed in a lot of hotels. My personal rating is 3 points, and another 0.3 point is deducted for the interlude. The overall personal rating of the hotel is 2.7 points.

Now, on the way to the airport, I wrote a lot. The above are all my own feelings. Everyone’s experience may be different. Maybe you feel good to experience it. The information is for your reference only.

I came to Sunshine 1 for the second time, so there is no need to talk about breakfast, very yummy family members. It's in a delicious state! The service is also in place, speaking softly and not abruptly. Afternoon tea is also very good to shoot, the table is full, and it is freshly made, unlike the smell of refrigerators in some hotels.
The environment is very good, the whole hotel has a woody fragrance, but it is pungent. The environmentally friendly hotel is simple and generous, with designer style. I think it is the latest and youngest style of Haitang Bay decoration, which is very suitable for young people.
The sky pool is very easy to shoot, and you can ask a photographer to shoot underwater, it's beautiful!
Family members, rush!

msg:I flew for vacation with my husband on the weekend, and the hotel in Haitang Bay looked at the last selected Sunshine One. Not disappointed at all, super satisfied. Because it has just opened, the facilities as a whole are very new, and every place has a real sense of design. I really like the original ecological feeling. Have a drink in the sky bar at night.
Be sure to praise the service staff for their superb service attitude. It is the kind of warm and sincere feeling. My husband said that he is most afraid that the enthusiastic service staff will make him overwhelmed, but this restaurant does not make him feel that way at all. Instead, it feels intimate.
Before I came, I read in Xiaohongshu that there are very few types of breakfast, which made me worry a little. It is really unnecessary to worry. The main food may not be as many as other five-star foods, but they are all exquisite. Most of the fried noodles are readily available in other hotels, and this restaurant is freshly cooked. And there are seven or eight kinds of beverages and juices, and there are more than a dozen varieties of breads, each of which looks delicious. The breakfast was great. It is recommended to stay early. It costs 268 people to buy it on the spot.
I think I can definitely get a full score for the whole stay. The only drawback may be that we don't have our own beach, but because we stayed at the Wanning Sheraton the night before, we had enough beaches. So this is no problem for us. The scenery in this hotel is enough for us to take a walk haha

msg:My god! The ceiling of the Sanya Hotel is really going to blow up this store!
Really, really, the service is so good, right?
It’s about 41 minutes away from the airport. You can’t smoke indoors or outdoors. This is our first impression of this store. I wonder if you *what would you dare to smoke for your customers?
The result... I'm serious, I'm willing to quit smoking for two days!
When I stayed in, the front desk told me that I was given a coconut chicken hot pot
You know, gifts, who don’t understand, it will definitely not be good, anyway, I thought that before eating!
After I went there, my mother, this is a gift? It’s like buying coconut chicken hot pot and sending it to the hotel! Four or five people circled me, and the condiments were brought over and picked for me. There was nothing to say. I was embarrassed at the end of the meal!
It was relatively late to go out to play and return to the hotel. I wanted to go to the lounge on the ninth floor to use up the wine vouchers presented. As a result, the house was closed for 8 minutes.
If the normal situation is gone, we will have no story. But this hotel doesn't. The clerk enthusiastically guided us to our seats and put us directly on the side dish and fruit plate. Tell me that I can stay as long as I want. Who can stand this? Although the scenery is beautiful, but I have a thin face, I have to go, and they said, take it back for us to drink!!! Take it back!!! Actually, the free coupon I got, I packed it. A lot of wine and side dishes!
Also, its bathrobes are so easy to wear!! It should be an environmentally friendly hotel. I think its cups are made from red wine bottles, and the toothbrushes are made of wood.
That's right! There is also this swimming pool service! I only brought myself to Sanya this time. The sunscreen and swimming goggles were all provided by the hotel, so considerate!
Oh, yes! What made me decide that I must blow it up was the ability of their family to clean up the room! I came back from swimming and saw the mess of cosmetics on my table, clothes on the floor, everything they divided into divisions The function is well placed, I am really touched, the hotel will help me arrange it at most, this hotel staff actually has their own thinking when cleaning up! My heart! Really! My mother didn't treat me like this! Damn service! I don't know what this waiter is called! I think someone who marries her must have a very comfortable life!
Oh oh oh! And! They also gave away a bunch of small cookies! There are two handmade necklaces! And daily fruits! I can’t finish talking, really **!
In the end, how much did I spend? I only spent 2187. 2100 is the housing and 87 is the service fee for coconut chicken. It’s not that I’m talking about **. For this little money, it doesn’t cost more than 800 to live in Houhai Village. A thousand yuan can serve this point! It's capped! It's okay! Xiao Zhang has nothing to say! Really** Yes! Give me a shot! Go live!

I have stayed in almost all hotels in Haitang Bay, but the service is warm to the bottom of my heart. In my heart, the only ones I have are Addison and Sunshine.
Think about what the residents think, every service staff is really gentle, really every one is gentle, within their abilities, as long as your requirements are met within their abilities, I I feel that evaluating a hotel can’t just use good or bad evaluation, and the comfort of your stay (including mental and physical feelings), this time I took my baby aunt and my girlfriend to live together for three days, and I was moved countless times (because of I have enough water in the room every day; because I like to eat bread from the restaurant, when I want to buy some, the waiter cuts me half directly...) Although they are all very detailed and small things , But remember your preferences every day, it is really taken seriously.
correct
Breakfast is delicious
The concept of the hotel is very good (returning naturally) The green plants are really hard to take care of, so I really look at it very carefully
Children's playground is fun
The pool is beautiful, the photos are beautiful
I love the noodle shop
Anyway, I will definitely choose here next time.
I have also strongly recommended it to my friends.

msg:A hotel with great care in every aspect! The hardware of the new hotel is excellent, and the four swimming pools in Sanya are also one of the most distinctive and have their own characteristics. Another thing that impresses me is that the service staff and staff in all aspects of the hotel have a good sense of active service and take the initiative to greet customers. This feeling is better than the general five-star hotels in Sanya and comparable to luxury brand hotels. There is also the general appearance of the little brothers and sisters in the hotel. The appearance value per capita is the first in Sanya! The hotel’s breakfast is good, with exquisite content and full food. Food and beverage consumption is slightly more expensive, not in proportion to house prices. The room still has a sea view. Although it is separated by a road, the line of sight is still possible on the 6th floor and the waves and sea breeze are still audible. Finally, thank the staff, Miss Yuki, for your patience and providing various benefits! Your excellent work has made 1 hotel five-star shining in the hearts of every customer you serve, and also made me willing to spend a few more minutes to write this review. I also want to thank the room service staff Chunmei, your service attentively made us deeply unforgettable. Prospective customers who have read reviews are welcome to spend a romantic and happy trip to Sanya at 1 Hotel! Warm reminder, at least 3 nights to be satisfied!

The overall experience is great value! The hotel focuses on environmental protection. Environmental protection concepts such as green, cotton and linen can be seen everywhere. The unique paper hangers made of different materials can be collected and taken home. There are three swimming pools in the hotel. The transparent swimming pool is suitable for adults, and the one near the main building is suitable for parents and children, meeting the needs of different residents. There is no lack of modernity in the log style of the room, the comfort of the bedding is good, and the view of the room is also good. The most commendable is the breakfast at the hotel. Haitang Bay is the best. There is no one. It takes into account nutrition, category, color, freshness, north and south preferences, and breakfast with rice rolls, raw porridge, pancakes, fruits, and fried noodles! Really eat to help the wall out! The types of bread and cakes are also very complete, and the taste is also very good!

msg:The design style of the hotel has its own characteristics (soul), the decoration materials are also very environmentally friendly, and there is almost no plastic waste when staying in the hotel. The starry sky bar on the ninth floor is cool and comfortable, especially comfortable! The hotel's service is also just right, it is not too polite and does not appear to be too superior to the guests. I personally like this kind of service. Finally, a special thanks to Miss Hunter (Xiao Wu) in the guest depar**ent of the hotel, because it is the first time to stay in this hotel, Miss Sister took the initiative to add WeChat, and then you can consult Miss Hunter if you need help! Finally, the young lady who left the shop did not forget the warm greetings and inquired about the check-in experience. The above is the experience of staying this time. Next time classmates and friends from other places come to Sanya, they will still choose to stay.

msg:I originally wanted to score five points, but I didn't expect that the afternoon tea session before check out was greatly reduced... I lived in the poolside room, served cocktails and afternoon tea, and experienced the gym. It was all very good. The infinity pool didn't open until 10 o'clock. I wanted to go early the next morning, but the sun was too late at 9 o'clock, which is equivalent to the difference in this swimming pool. The breakfast is the best I have ever eaten, not the same as in ordinary hotels. But the afternoon tea I was given was also the worst I have ever eaten. The only level of marshmallow meringue biscuits and refreshing tonic (Figure 10) was really disappointing. I didn’t even take off the mask and let my companions eat something and hurried away. This afternoon tea is a waste of my time. The whole wonderful experience is ruined in the last link... Why is it called afternoon tea if you only provide these... It is a bonus if you put it at the front desk in the lobby.

The whole a**osphere is young and fashionable, and the price positioning is reasonable. But the location of the hotel is a little bit off, it's about 15 minutes drive away from the duty-free shop and other Haitang Bay attractions. So it is recommended to stay by car. Another problem is that the rooms of the new hotel still have a little decoration smell. It is recommended to have more ventilation. The highlight of the breakfast is their drinks, especially the carrot and ginger mixed juice, which is n times better than the Shanghai wagas. For dinner, we ate at the farmhouse restaurant "Yixiaoyuan Farmstay" opened by the hotel. The lychee wood roast chicken over there is really delicious yyds, and the group purchase price is very reasonable.

🧹Sanitation: Very new hotel, the whole is very clean, quite in place
🍃Environment: Divide into two parts, in-store: This is a fully designed hotel, which is very different from traditional hotels. You will not see any exaggerated and luxurious decoration, but the sense of luxury can still be reflected very well. Outside the store: Both sides are hotels under construction. Small areas are not perfect enough. There is no private beach. The net celebrity pool looks beautiful from the outside. The actual depth of the water is relatively shallow, which is not enough for swimming. The glass curtain wall is also in the water. I can't see any good scenery. It's good to take pictures at four or five o'clock in the afternoon and go to the lounge chair to rest.
🔔Service: This time I booked two hotels in Sanya. Compared with a certain lira’s indifferent, I feel that Sunshine One attaches great importance to customers. Every staff member has a very good attitude and is always greeted with a smile. of.
For catering, I did not experience the two-day afternoon tea because of the delay in the itinerary.
The buffet’s juice drinks are a must hhh
I also ordered a Tomahawk steak set meal, the meat quality is very good, but the cooking is not good, the matching grilled vegetables and seafood baked rice are very good 👌

In addition, the quality of service is quite in place. The entire hotel staff from the front desk butler to the cleaning staff are very polite, and the service is attentive.

msg:The design of the hotel is very good. Films are produced everywhere, suitable for taking pictures. The transparent swimming pool is even more popular with Internet celebrities, praise!
The room size is fair, the facilities are new, the water temperature is stable (the water pressure is slightly lower), and the bed is comfortable and well received.
The view of the room on the night of check-in was slightly flawed, and the room was changed happily the next day, and the service was good.
Finally, let me remind you that the hotel does not directly rely on the sea. If you want to go to the beach, you need to walk across the road. Students who expect to go out to be on the beach should be cautious (but you are ready to take pictures in the hotel). There are many hotel swimming pools, but because of the orientation problem, they have been exposed to direct sunlight for a long time, and the role of sun loungers is also limited. This feels that the store can find ways to improve it, which will increase the comfort of the poolside.

I planned to change the place for the second night, but after arriving at the hotel, my husband said that he liked the environment here , Feeling quiet and isolated, we continued to stay here for one night. The sanitation is very clean, the toilet and bathroom smell a bit strange. The most satisfying thing about this stay is the cleaning aunt. She cleans us more than once every day. Even if the room is not messy, she will help us organize all kinds of small things. Every time we come back, the room is clean and very comfortable. When we first arrived at the hotel on the first day, the doorman helped us open the door, but did not guide the position of the lobby. At that time, there were four doormen standing at the door. After opening the door, we didn’t know which way to go. Then the door Tong just helped the next guest to open the door, and the remaining two doormen stood in place. Breakfast is in line with my appetite. The best thing I have eaten these days is probably breakfast. The traffic is really inconvenient, because the location is relatively biased, and most of them are taxis. I like the hotel’s swimming pool very much and it is very clean. If it’s not because of a tight schedule, I would like to spend a day in the swimming pool. Generally speaking, I am satisfied, but I may not come again for the second time. One experience is enough.

Emphasize! The hotel does not divide the beach 🏖️, because it is separated from the sea by a large road, and it takes at least 10 minutes to walk there.

🔔Service: It is very worth mentioning. If you can give -100 points, you will give it. From the time of check-in, the front desk feels that the business is very immature. No one arranges the order, and only makes the guests wait impatiently. Because the location and the flow of people were too complicated, I decided to withdraw for three nights. After negotiating many times, Ctrip also helped to fight for it. Finally, the manager came to handle the refund... Very unpleasant experience
Generally speaking, the cheapest room is not worth 1.5K, and it is worth up to 800

It may be because of the large number of people, so the personnel services and equipment need to be improved. We stayed in the little yellow duck parent-child room. When we took a bath, the floor of the shower room did not leak, and the water was full of the sink outside. About the service: When I checked in, there was only one customer in front, but I don’t know why it took a long time. The lobby manager saw that I was waiting for a long time, and immediately called the person in the background to come out to handle it. Regarding the check-out, I communicated in advance to check out at 2:00, and I verbally said that it would not exceed 1:30 at the latest. But called at 1 o'clock to urge. Does it make me think that the previous communication is invalid? When I checked out, I emphasized that I have a bill for consumption in the sky bar. The service staff said that it can be deducted from your deposit. Just give her the room card and it will be done. . As a result, I called after 3 days and said that the deduction was not successful, and I needed to pay again. The people in the hotel were friendly and communicative throughout the whole process, but it can feel unprofessional when these things happen. So 3 points.

msg:I know that it may be late to get a room during the holidays, but it is too much for me to wait until 6:30 to get the room smoothly. The front desk service staff feels that there is a serious shortage of staff, and the attitude of the service staff is that they are helpless to work overtime and do a job. Why do they not have such a large capacity to sell so many rooms? Bad experience! There shouldn't be a next time.

The sanitation is very good, the hotel facilities are very complete, my family and I like it very much. At first, I was attracted by this hotel's green theme. After arriving at the hotel, the service was very attentive from the moment I stepped into the door of the hotel, and the hotel staff were also very enthusiastic and very happy. There are many services in the hotel, all with free coupons. Free cocktails, dining vouchers, and buffet vouchers. Breakfast is very human and will be served late. Don’t worry, set the alarm clock to have breakfast. There are many swimming pools of various styles, and the hotel is very close to Water World and duty-free shops. A very good travel experience.

The hotel is really superb. No beach, no sea. How super beautiful, super delicious, super fun. I booked the garden pool room and I was surprised to see the sea. 
Parent-child elements are very rich. The baby in the amu*****t park does not want to come out. Every day, there are parent-child interaction lessons. The pool is also very good. The floating board swimming ring can be used for free. There is also acrylic pool sunbathing with wireless drinks. 
Thanks again to Hotel Allen for the good service. You can feel the hotel's intentions before you arrive at the hotel. 
Highly recommended.

The decoration of the room is warm and homey. The outdoor scenery is also very nice and simple, with a 55-flat net red transparent floating swimming pool. Have the opportunity to stay again.

Before I checked in, I learned a little through the introduction of Allen from the Guest Relations Depar**ent of Sunshine One Hotel. Thank you very much for his introduction. The service is very good and in place 👍
From the moment I reached the entrance of the hotel, I saw the large 1 sign of the hotel ✅, and I could see the net celebrity pool at a glance. The first impression is great 👍
On the right is the check-in place in the hotel lobby. The front desk service is also very good. The service is very good. I saw that I took the children to upgrade the room for free. I carefully introduced the location of the room and some places suitable for children to play. I don’t remember the name, just remember her with glasses👓
The first feeling of the hotel room, 👍 very special, very nice👍
Although I only stayed for one day, I feel very good about Sunshine One Hotel in general. (Check in 👍Diet 👍)

msg:Write down this hotel review in your spare time!
Really super super recommended! The hotel is a newly opened hotel, so all the facilities can keep up. In the distance, this hotel is really not that kind of luxury style, but you can make a film when you are in the hotel. This is by far the most environmentally friendly hotel in China. Even if its theme is environmental protection, your accommodation experience has not shrunk at all, but all the details of the service are in place! The door card of the room is made of wooden material with chips, the clothes rack in the room is made of wood, and there are hangers made of recycled homework books, and the cup should be a stone or stone-like ceramic, even the usual sticky notes. They are all made of wood, which can be repeatedly written on the wood board. The decoration of the room is a Japanese style but a simple style. It is very comfortable. I have not seen plastic products in the entire hotel. I have my own toiletries. The same hotel It will also be provided. The hotel has several restaurants, allowing you to have different choices, buffet and Chinese-style ordering. I especially praise the Green House restaurant, which just happens to be birthday cakes and birthday noodles. The hotel is about ten minutes away from the duty-free shop by taxi, so I think it’s very convenient to live here to go shopping. The hotel will also have a shuttle bus to the duty-free shop, and there is a 5% discount, all need to make an appoin**ent one day in advance! Finally, the customer service Allen was very caring and asked about our return flight to help us arrange a late check-out. We will definitely choose to live here when we go to Sanya!

From morning to night, including eating and children’s activities every day and every part of the hotel is not just the facade. The details are close. The full-point waiters are also meticulous and thoughtful, including the restaurant’s guitar, freshly fried steak, and freshly tuned cocktails, including the teachers who bring children from morning to night, cleaning the curtains, lighting, toothbrushes, slippers, bathrobes and even drinking water in the guest room twice a day. Can't fault it. This is the second hotel that will be revisited during this trip around the island.
 The teachers at the bonfire party of Rebecca Little Seedlings in the hotel are all great. Coke brother, Tao Zi, sister and two. I forgot my name. There is also the cleaner Man Keqiong. If you come to Sanya, please come and try if you are right about the hotel. Anything is good if you must ask

Then I have to mention that the glass suspended swimming pool is very popular. The sun umbrellas by the pool are from JC's family. The special color is full of grids. Both the room interior and the greenery are arranged carefully. In addition, the Little Seedling Children's Club in the hotel has many activities during the summer vacation, which is very good. The customer service May contacted in advance to arrange the duty-free city discount for us in advance, and also answer our inquiries during the period. It was very quiet during the stay, and the construction nearby was basically stopped. Except there is no private beach, everything else is fine. It is worth staying in Haitang Bay.

The design of the room is minimalist ins style, fully open toilet, dry and wet separation, visually extremely comfortable; facilities are also in place, capsule coffee machine, Bluetooth small steel cannon speakers... you can enjoy your own world even if you don't leave the hotel. It is also worth mentioning that the hotel pool area is also of various depths and sizes, suitable for different groups of people. Of course, there is also an Internet celebrity pool. I think it is like a big fish tank. Next time in Sanya Haitang Bay, it will be Preferred.

The view is excellent and the scenery is superb. All the hotel facilities are very new. The tree trunks and "grass" walls in the lobby of the hotel are decorated with volcanic ash stone, and all the details in the rooms are very design. It also revealed the concept of environmental protection. Walking around in the hotel, you can hear very fashionable background music, which makes people feel very happy.
The only drawback is that the biggest bright spot is that the transparent net red swimming pool does not allow children to play, which is a bit disappointing.

Some small designs on environmental protection are also very good, like one! I was impressed by the fact that their switchboard was very good, and no one answered after making two calls. After that, they always had the opportunity to call back if they needed help. But making the night bed was a bit casual. I laid a floor towel on the first day.

I went for a drink in the evening and the food was fresh and distinctive. The rooms are very new, with special features, environmentally friendly themes, and there are several large and small swimming pools. There is no need to worry about the problem of crowds and children swimming unhappy, especially the Internet celebrity pool is super, there will be towels, fruit tea and sunscreen beside the pool.

Hahahaha, but fortunately, the hotel front desk manager helped us upgrade the room type for free after learning about the situation (very Thank you~) and delivered a welcome drink (ps: by the way, I went to Sanya so many hotels, and the coolest woody fragrance in the lobby of Sunshine 1 permeated the whole hotel) I was very satisfied with the seafood in the green house for the next few days. have eaten! Especially this 🦐! simply! The crispy Hainanese chicken is also very good! I have eaten for two days in a row and the Yusanpin is also very special. I came to buy three sets and thought it was a set meal system, only to find out that it was a Chinese restaurant. I thought there was no way to refund, but the restaurant staff immediately helped me to consult and give me a refund after knowing it. (Thank you~) The hotel’s breakfast can also be said to be very hearty. The hotel at the same price level has no sunshine at all. However, the price of the hotel’s food is not low, but the taste is acceptable, but the pool’s bbq let me A little disappointed at the price of 488. I thought it would be a seafood feast, that is, the visual result. The dishes were not particularly large. In order to wait for this bbq, I also changed the ticket and stayed one more night. It is a pity that I hope it can be improved. After all, the limited-time buffet dishes are rich twice a week. The level is not enough, and the hotel pasta feels that the pastry chef of the hotel may be poor in craftsmanship, but it is smooth and smooth. It can be said that it has nothing to do with it. Maybe my opposite is too high, but in other aspects, it is also very good.
 [The hotel's afternoon tea area still has the hotel’s unique woody fragrance, but the service attitude is really discounted. On the first day, I used the afternoon tea voucher. The staff were very friendly and told that "you can sit anywhere" but the first day. The two days are different. I just wanted to ask if the price of a la carte meal is more expensive than your afternoon tea set. But when I walked in and I didn’t order, you just gave me a sentence and there was no place to ask me to sit on the edge. fine If there is a plate on the table, it’s okay if I don’t sit there. But if you don’t have it, you don’t allow me to sit. I don’t want to spend more than one seat. Give me a sentence, "All seats are reserved." I asked, "The guests choose by themselves." You’re hesitating (I hope you can answer in seconds next time, or the wording will be more false), and you answered me "Yes, the guest decides to choose a seat by himself" and told me, “Guests don’t want to sit at the door, so don’t take a seat. “I’m not a customer if I’m stumped? I can only change the booking when the flight is cancelled that day. By the way, that afternoon, until the meal, the little brother said that the “afternoon tea guests” did not come for afternoon tea😅😅 😅 On the contrary, the one sitting next door is the big brother who sits for a day with a glass of white water. You are also ashamed to say that the customer comes to your place by yourself. Don’t you feel hot on your face. Treat the customer like this. 😅 If you don’t order your afternoon tea set, you don’t deserve to be a god. 😅😅It means that I don’t deserve it 😅Just your yin-yang weird suggestion that someone else will debate with you early on the spot😅Thank Dade for meeting me who is too lazy to care about you😅I recommend afternoon tea and I’m not in the mood for afternoon tea. You might as well write a wordless lie. story】
But the good thing is that the room service is so detailed that it can’t be more detailed. Originally, the bed was a thick quilt and felt hot, so I removed the mezzanine. I came back the next day and saw the newly laid quilt cover and sheets and extra quilt~ The rest of the hotel is basic I just take away the lining and won’t add an extra bed. (It’s really thoughtful for the next few days to be afraid of the cold. I do feel the love of the thick quilt for me again. Hahahaha) The toiletries were all messy after I came back on the counter. Even the toothbrush is neat! ! ! (I hope that the catering depar**ent in the afternoon tea area will also learn about the work of other people’s room service) 😅
Probably that’s it. Anyway, I’m not recommended to go for afternoon tea. Scones are more satisfied. Sandblasting, pits, pits, and greasy. Strawberry cream, apple cup. The taste is overhybridized. The one that says "I’m the pigment, come and eat me" is recommended. Speed change If you take a picture, you can eat it, but if it’s for delicious, you don’t need to suggest ordering other parfait cups and snack
However, other aspects of the hotel can be said to be very good, it must be highly recommended. The swimming pool is also very distinctive. The water quality is also ok. There are many excellent places, but there are also many areas that deserve improvement. I hope that you can have a different experience next time you come to your hotel

In the off-peak season, the room is upgraded to a sea view room for free, and there is a special person to take you to the room, and a special person to help deliver the luggage to the room. The front desk provides free fruit, but the variety is small (the passion fruit is the sweetest I have ever eaten, recommended). Every detail of the hotel and even the room shows the concept of environmental protection. Every place in the hotel can be photographed like a blockbuster.
The location is a bit remote, there is no place to eat around, you can only ** takeout, the restaurant in the hotel is expensive, 2 people eat a little better for 600, 700, the buffet breakfast is super good, the level of a 7-star hotel, there are many choices, and the taste is super good! !

msg:This is the first time I have stayed at this hotel. It is located in Haitang Bay. I already felt the warm reception from the concierge before entering the lobby. The air was filled with a strong floral fragrance. All the staff were in light blue light blue suits, which made people instantly To increase the intimacy, I only stayed here for one night. Two things were impressive: First, I checked in and talked about my requirements, but found that they were not satisfied after I arrived in the room. The person in charge of the customer service center took the initiative to deal with the call after receiving the call and gave a free fruit plate to express his apologies. I felt that the hotel’s service to the guests was proactive and humane, so the final episode did not affect the mood of the stay. I booked a yacht surfing the next morning. As the time was not calculated, it was too late to have breakfast, so I had to go to the western restaurant to pack. The service supervisor Anna made me very heartwarming. After learning about the three of us, it was considerate. Let the waiter bring us more juice and fruit, including enough bread. At that time, I was very moved. I really realized the feeling of being warm and caring during the trip. The stay at Sunshine One brought us a perfect end to our trip in Sanya. , I will stay here next time because it makes me feel at home

We saw the Atlantis Westin before, and finally chose the newly opened Sunshine One. The whole service was super good, the staff was super nice, and they gave me a small gift when I left. The sanitation of the hotel is very good. The waiter will put the mess of cosmetics and toiletries on the small squares to help me arrange them one by one, and the night ritual. I have lived in the Sheraton Westin jw Marriott brands before, but this one can definitely be second*.

msg:The worst hotel I stayed in this trip to Sanya, especially the super poor service attitude, not referring to the hotel owner. There was a male staff member who had an extremely bad attitude and waited for a long time during the check-in process. This is understandable because There were a lot of people at that time. After finally getting the room card, the door of the room could not open the door, so I called the front desk and said that someone came up to deliver the room card, but it took a long time to come. The main point is that the corridor of the guest room is outside. Everyone knows how hot the weather in Sanya is in late June, so we waited at the door of the guest room for a long time and still didn't come up. Later, I went to the front desk, and the male service person said something with a very poor attitude: room card If you can't open it, go to the front desk, what are you going to do with me! I? ? ? ? It is incomparable with the JW Marriott and the Grand Hyatt that stayed behind.

服務：服務沒的説，工作人員Emma很nice，熱情且服務到位，還有個忘記名字的禮賓小帥哥也不錯，其它服務人員也都好。

設施：設施很新了，我在三亞住過海棠灣，亞龍灣，大東海這些酒店裡設施最好最新，維護最棒的。

環境：綠色節能的設計理念貫徹到每一個細節，和周邊其他的酒店形成了鮮明的對比，這種超前的理念真不錯。

早餐：特別好，尤其是西餐，相較於傳統酒店的傲慢，壹酒店的認真注意細節簡直上了大分。

當然非一線海景這一點如果你不介意的話，那他就是個十全十美的酒店

msg:三亞海棠灣陽光壹酒店1Hotel 真實打卡
這次來三亞體驗了海棠灣的陽光壹酒店。起初是被它的名字吸引，瞭解一下知道了它是以環保理念為主題的，主打一個親近自然的風格。服務：一到酒店就會有服務生迎接開車門推行李，前台Anne很熱情，問什麼都很耐心。另外，因為我沒有帶浴缸套，酒店直接讓服務生來當面又消毒清潔了一下，很細心，還給我拿了泡泡浴和浴鹽！總之服務態度挺不錯。
早餐餐品比較豐富，中西結合還有海南一些菜品，有很多果蔬、各種飲品。其次，酒店很有設計感，特別適合拍照。送的旅拍也很好看，特別出片！強烈推薦這個酒店！

設施：無邊大泳池深得我心，下午晚上去游泳感覺特別好，雖然離海隔了條馬路，但完全沒有在泳池舒服
衞生：正海景房非常好，視野完美，保潔也打掃的非常乾淨，設計完美符合我的預期
環境：酒店進來就會伴隨着香氣，很多俄羅斯人，年輕人的比例比其他的酒店都要高，雖然來的幾天天氣不是很好，但是在陽台上安安靜靜的看着海就已經非常滿足，這次入住的房間 lobby 和餐廳在一棟樓，就很方便。
早餐算是前幾的，作為麪包腦袋每天都會非常期待早餐，西瓜汁和哈密瓜汁我能喝好幾杯，希望後邊能出幾款鹹口的～
在陽光壹的兩天是整個旅程最悠閑的時光，下次來三亞一定還會再來

去年入住印象不錯，所以今年才再次選擇陽光壹，但整體很失望。

設施：衞生間門有問題，關上打不開；空調難操控，大中午的室內温度二十七八度。

服務：我衹住一晚，遇到以上兩個問題，服務人員都是在我再三催促下才過來處理。需要拿兩瓶水，等到我退房了才告訴我拿過來了。
全程沒有管家一説，我都退完房了，才聯繫我問我要不要地址？估計你是在催我退房吧？
不知道是不是削減了工作人員，整體服務效率低下，不會再來了。

房間內處處可見帶着年輪的傢俱，視覺和觸感都很舒服，甚至牙杯都的葡萄酒瓶的加工，萬萬沒有想到房卡居然是木頭做的小圓片，處處都是新意實打實的酒店，不過多宣傳，正和我們年輕人的胃口，這次的入住體驗對陽光壹真的刮目相看，工作人員服務也很到位，賓客關係anne回覆信息及時，很貼心。

酒店兩個特色，泳池和設計感

【游泳池】不用多説看圖和視頻，夠大+透明+怎麼拍都能出片，喜歡游泳的不來打卡，我衹能説你虧麻了

【酒店設計】我不怎麼會拍照的，隨便一拍感覺也還可以（時間緊沒找酒店免費的旅拍），設計各種細節即美觀又實用，細節太多建議自己可以體驗下，都説完了就沒勁了

【管家服務】非常貼心耐心，謝謝rose小姐姐，附贈了飲料和小食，還協助我們規劃了遊玩路線

整體來講本次海南呆了快1個月，泳池和整體設計感top1的酒店，難得寫那麼多字的評價，喜歡游泳的朋友千萬不要錯過，因為後面行程密集我挺遺憾沒能多住幾天的，下次還會來

有優點也有缺點：
優點：管家Jenny很貼心，入住前幫忙確認入住時間預約旅拍，退房幫忙延時1小時。大堂門口禮賓部的員工都很負責幫忙開車門搬運行李。裝修風格很出片，泳池設計很棒透明設計有潛水的感覺，整個酒店有木質香比較心曠神怡。
缺點：地理位置太糟糕了在一個山上，如果每天要出行不建議選擇，早餐種類少不好吃不值得買含早，但住在山上不得不吃。旅拍選照片的時候給你看精修，選好了免費的給的就是原片，要精修一張30。別的酒店都是直接給精修。樓層低的床品比較潮，房間經常飛進來馬蜂蒼蠅還有不認識的蟲子，但因為位置在山裡也可以理解。可以等淡季來酒店常駐一下，這次住最便宜的都要房型2K其實不如選擇其他的體系酒店。

感謝jenny小可愛的接待和服務 真的超級棒🥳因為入住體驗特別好所以又續了一天
本來以為從文華和柏悦過來會有落差（而且我們為了省錢這次衹訂了普通房型）但是真的完全超出預期的好！管家jenny在門口專門等待我入住（她好可愛）然後選擇的房間景色也很美～很開心很開心
酒店的餐廳很有特點 那個壹麪超級無敵好吃 然後早餐也很不錯 最近出去玩聽司機説好多人專門來這裏吃飯😂美食家們一定要選擇這裏哈哈哈哈！

很多地方都有巧妙的設計，門卡也是循環利用的木片，大堂連廊的瓦片設計，整牆活綠植角落的枯樹枝做的隔斷，還有透明泳池都很好看，餐廳邊的狗尾巴草太可愛了拍照也很出片，
入住體驗，服務不錯，很迅速，大堂還有水果茶和水果自取，房間minibar也可以免費床超大，很舒服席夢思下的黑標，洗漱用品基本木製很特別，味道很好聞喜歡（檀香木香茶香， nice），泳池用的毛巾又厚又軟，  工作人員ANNE 安排的也很到位  下次來三亞 還會在選擇陽光壹。

酒店位置居高風很大但很舒服
酒店除了三個小泳池之外還有一個巨大的無邊泳池很出片
洗漱用品一直是我想推薦的，據説都是植物提取，使用感泡沫很豐富一股天然的精油味兒包括房間裏的香薰都是植物的味道很治癒
工作人員的態度都超級温柔面帶微笑任何時候見到都會禮貌問好，真的很不錯有種賓至如歸的感覺

酒店恆温泳池真的很好，孩子很喜歡。酒店旅拍👌不錯取景技術好很值得嘗試。

管家Anne有求必應，退房衹要求延到13點直接給延到14點，退房還送了洗浴套裝。列入二刷酒店範疇。

新開發的海棠灣陽光壹酒店私隱做得非常好，風景美，類似園林景觀酒店非常適合休養，就在酒店可以玩兩天，所以這類酒店更適合情侶和帶長者出遊。
房間設施：整體是木質結構，房間設備新，配備前台水果自助，房間膠囊咖啡機+咖啡。床非常舒適，陽台風景太美了。
泳池懸空姿態非常漂亮。
服務：賓客關係Steven非常熱情 同時安排了小布置和蛋糕。每次回酒店下車門僮小哥哥都服務非常好。給人感覺很舒適。
位置交通：這類酒店周圍比較荒涼，所以適合在酒店玩，要出去必須叫車，安靜是最大的優點，非常好叫車，三亞叫車非常便利。所以無論你住哪，都不用擔心出行不便

服務：普通房型沒有專業的管家服務的，迷你吧收費可樂28一瓶。添加前台微信一會高先生一會李先生，辦理入住時候前台比較忙，我們是三點後去的，告訴我們還在查房，要等一會，等了好久要自己問才知道可以入住，沒人告知。

msg:這次來三亞玩首次入住陽光1，管家Jenny提前一天微信聯繫我們，還一直為房間上心提前通知了房間加急打掃，為我們節省了很多等房的時間，酒店入住的時候會主動幫忙送行李到房間，服務很貼心。壹酒店源於自然的理念無處不在，整體設施都很新，房間風格主打原木風，非常簡約時尚環保，整個酒店都充滿着原木的氣息。

msg:非常安靜的臨海酒店，適合繁忙一年後的靜音修養。酒店主打環保理念，白樺林裝飾的酒店大堂很有風情，火山石堆砌的圍牆，晚風吹起的蘆葦意境實物。
這次三亞之行住了三家酒店，這家酒店的服務最無微不至的，路過的所有工作人員都很熱情友好，聯繫最多的是我的管家Rose，頭一天加微信問我預計入住時間，發了各種酒店活動，每天問候是否有問題。有問必答回覆速度很快，感謝你的照顧。
這家酒店的早餐是值得誇讚的，現場製作，看着大廚們給你做新鮮的三明治，小麪，鮮榨果汁等等，特別多吃。
退房後有不要的物品，服務人員主動短訊告知是不是遺忘了，這是我住過所有酒店唯一主動聯繫過的，值得信賴。
天際泳池30°恆温現在的天氣也可以下水，我實在怕冷就沒下，春節期間到訪應該很享受。
酒店雖然不能直接通道沙灘，但也就過一個小馬路就能到，酒店後門有工作人員提供浴巾防曬霜飲用水，撿撿貝殼蠻有意思，這片海灘風浪很大不適合游泳，人少安靜，躺海看海很愜意。
總之五星好評值得入住的酒店，推薦！
本人很懶不願意寫評價，超級潔癖，從各個方面都衹有真心滿意才動動筆桿子。真實評價！就為了休假躺酒店太懶沒拍什麼照片。

陽光壹總結來説就是環境很新很棒，壹廚餐廳很好吃，早餐豐富，晚餐套餐無論是質量還是數量都很滿意。賓客主管steven很熱情，很早就主動聯繫，給佈置了迎賓，選擇了不錯的房間位置。天際泳池遊玩體驗很不錯。下午的水療體驗很舒服，晚上天空吧小酌體驗也非常棒。
唯一就是酒店沒法直通沙灘，不過海棠灣的沙灘確實也沒啥玩的，浪很大沒法和亞龍灣或者清水灣比，感覺是不一樣的。
總的來説非常適合有泡酒店需求的遊客選擇。

msg:酒店整體規模適宜完全不嘈雜，對非親子的我們來説很安靜自在。
升級了海景房，每天躺在床上看日出和賞月，房間設施都簡約有質感，佈局合理舒適，晚上躺在沙發椅翻翻房間裏的bbc畫冊真的是歲月靜好。
樓道和酒店大堂都是開放式的，進進出出感覺很好。
娛樂設施的話主要體驗了天際泳池，恆温視野好。
另外就是自助早餐真的很不錯，品種非常全並且完全沒有雞肋難吃的單品，西式的麪包甜點和中式的湯粉拌粉還有各式果蔬等。
總而言之非常適合單純泡酒店的過個兩三天，唯一就是周圍的外賣會稍微少一些，我們去了次三公裡外的林旺夜市，真的很熱鬧雖然很多人説臟亂差但是我們吃下來還行沒出啥大問題。
