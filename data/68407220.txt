msg:I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Renaissance in Shenzhen, and I must say that my experience was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I stepped into the hotel until the day of my departure, the hospitality and warmth extended by the staff, particularly Cherry and Olina, made my stay truly memorable.

Upon arrival, I was greeted by Cherry and Olina with a genuine smile and a warm welcome. Her professionalism and attention to detail were evident as she efficiently checked me in, providing all the necessary information about the hotel's facilities and amenities, ensuring that I had everything I needed for a pleasant stay.

What impressed me the most about both Cherry and Olina was their genuine commitment to customer satisfaction. They consistently displayed a high level of professionalism, courtesy, and attentiveness, making me feel like a valued guest. They were always ready to assist with a warm smile, and their genuine interest in ensuring that I had a memorable stay was evident in every interaction.

Moreover, the rest of the hotel staff also demonstrated the same level of hospitality and friendliness. The housekeeping staff maintained my room impeccably, and the restaurant staff provided excellent service and delectable culinary offerings.

The Renaissance Shenzhen itself is a stunning property with elegant decor, well-appointed rooms, and top-notch amenities. The comfortable bed, spacious bathroom, and modern conveniences provided a luxurious retreat after a long day of exploring the city. The hotel's facilities, including the fitness center and swimming pool, were also maintained to a high standard.

Furthermore, the location of the hotel was ideal, with easy access to Shenzhen's major attractions and business districts. Whether I wanted to explore the vibrant cityscape or indulge in the local culinary scene, everything was within reach.

In conclusion, my stay at the Renaissance Shenzhen was truly exceptional, thanks in large part to the outstanding hospitality of Cherry and Olina. Their warm and attentive service, along with the rest of the staff, created a welcoming and memorable experience. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Shenzhen, and I look forward to returning on my next visit.

msg:This is a great hotel situated at a beautiful area in the NanShan district. I booked the corner room and the views whilst taking a bath was amazing. There is bathing salt so as to prevent my skin getting to wrinkly after half an hour of bath. The room design is so elegant I would love to stay here for a few more days. A definite return to this hotel some time soon. 

The breakfast was delicious, not to mention the executive lounge experience-- wide choice of alcoholic beverages, and snacks in the evening. Excellent location for talking business.

This time I booked a twin room, which is spacious and has a wide view, overlooking the Science Park and Shenzhen Bay. Check-in was quick, and the hotel service was as good as always. The front desk and executive lounge staff were very enthusiastic and would take the initiative to greet. Candy in the executive lounge was particularly warm and hospitable, making people feel at home. This time I brought my kids here for the weekend, and they were also very impressed by Candy, saying that the drinks she mixed in the executive lounge were particularly delicious. It is also very convenient to eat, drink and have fun nearby, and the swimming pool facilities on the 45th floor are also good. I will bring my kids here for the weekend again.

A technician was arranged to fix the door at nearly 11 o'clock in the evening. I went up to the 57th floor to ask the front desk to change rooms. Fortunately, the hotel service made timely remedies and upgraded me to a suite. In the end, it was not until after 11 o'clock that everything was fixed. The most outrageous thing happened. At two o'clock in the morning, there were screams coming from the room next door. It lasted for nearly an hour. There was no sound insulation between the rooms. It felt like screams were happening next to my ears. It was splitting. The noise kept going from two o'clock to three o'clock before I fell asleep. In short, I might not be compatible with this hotel.

msg:Room view is ok
However, when I checked in, the receptionist told me that the exterior wall would be repaired the next day.
So there will be outdoor workers using hangers
If it is inconvenient, you can close the curtains
I stayed in this room just to enjoy the view
But I have to close the curtains due to outdoor work.
I asked if I could transfer to another room??
I "didn't feel" the attitude of the waiter wanting to help me solve my problem
Just say "No!!!"
Comprehensive two-day check-in and check-out staff
It didn’t give me the feeling of being very attentive or proactive.
Also, I called the front desk in the room to get some ice cubes.
The waiter who answered the phone was not very friendly either.
A classy hotel
I don't feel good about the attitude of the front-line waiter
Another day when I went to the restaurant for breakfast,
Ordered a bowl of noodle soup
But the noodles in the soup noodles are not cooked.
The noodles are still hard
I believe you just pour the soup into a bowl
I asked the restaurant waiter to come over and take a look
He asked me to make a new bowl of the food I ordered.
The waiter was very nice. After he finished cooking, he personally sent it back to me.
But inside a bowl of noodles made again
None of the food was what I ordered before.
And the noodles are cooked until they become mushy
I didn’t say that the previous bowl of noodles was too hard.
But the noodles are completely uncooked
Why come again and cook a bowl of noodles from scratch?
In addition, when I went to the reception desk on the ground to inquire about going to an attraction,
The waiters also responded to me with some unwillingness to answer.
Overall, the room, lobby and design of this hotel are pretty good.
But the attitude of the front desk staff really needs to be retrained.

The hotel's delivery service is very rigorous. You can help pick up takeout, but you need to communicate with the front desk by phone and sign an agreement. After all, it is food safety, which is understandable. The holiday delivery is also quite fast~
The TV in the room doesn't seem to be able to cast the screen~ It's a little regrettable~
The swimming pool is great~ The view is good, it's big and clean.

This is my first time staying at the Renaissance Shenzhen Bay Hotel, but it’s not a bad experience. The experience wasn’t bad, nor was it amazing. If this is a four-star hotel, it is indeed more than enough.

I booked a room on the executive floor. When I checked in, the waiter Summer was expressionless, cold and unenthusiastic. He also did not introduce the hotel's public facilities (such as swimming pools, breakfast arrangements, etc.).

The room is quiet and clean, with good sound insulation. It has an oval bathtub and you can see Chun Bamboo Building and the sea outside the window. The slippers in the room seem to be recycled.

I was overjoyed during the Happy Hour. There are many varieties of hot food, desserts, and fruits, and they taste good.

There are many kinds of breakfast food, but the taste is unexpectedly average and unremarkable. It is certainly not difficult to have enough food. If you have any requirements for breakfast, it is recommended that you think about it carefully first.

All in all, staying at the Renaissance Shenzhen Bay Hotel once is enough.

msg:All are quite satisfactory.
I came to chat with my friend's company in the Science Park, and found a hotel nearby.
The location is good, there are commercial facilities downstairs, and it is convenient to go to Shenzhen Bay.
The guest rooms are all in the high-rise area, with first-class views.
The decoration facilities and linens are OK, at least clean and tidy.
The service team is very good, the front desk, guest room, restaurant and concierge can all greet proactively and serve with a smile. I praise Ryu for the early check-in docking service and practical problem solving.
The overall cost performance of the hotel is already good. In the current situation, it is good to stay like this for business trips. If you want to save more, you can also book breakfast without breakfast, which can be solved by the cafe and noodle shop downstairs, and you can also experience the local customs.

msg:I have stayed at Renaissance in many cities, but this one is overrated...Except for the high-altitude breakfast on the 57th floor, there is nothing else to praise

1. No one from the concierge helped with the luggage, and no one even pressed the elevator to give instructions! ! Just stand there watching! They just said that the 57th floor is the lobby, and then let us go in and find it ourselves. It's not that they are too busy, but a few people just stood there and couldn't move at all. Only the guy who checked in the luggage at the end was more proactive and nice, which made me doubt the existence of the concierge? ? ? ?

2. The room facilities are old, and it doesn't look like it opened in 2020. It is unknown whether it is a renovation of the old hotel (after all, Renaissance loves to do this in Shenzhen). For example: even! Can't cast the screen! The TV! There is not even a welcome page... just a few TV stations for you to choose from, hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, and the old-fashioned toilet and the old-fashioned light wood decoration of the whole house with all-season texture... Every light control is an old original button... Of course, except for the interior of the room, the decoration of the lobby restaurant is still very Renaissance...

3. We booked two rooms, although we also have to thank the front desk lady for upgrading us to executive for free (to be honest, there is not much difference between executive and deluxe) and then gave us two rooms that are thousands of miles apart. When asked, there was no room, and there was only one room left on all floors. Oh, the business is so good, there are a lot of listings on the entire network and all channels, or only recognize the partner Feimouzhu, and other platforms can be dealt with casually

4. There are many dead corners in the room... a lot of dust...

5. The breakfast is ok and the scenery is beautiful, but the room facilities and services are completely incomparable to other Renaissance. Bye, there will be no next time

The scenery is amazing. I never thought that Renaissance's exterior scenery was so good. Outside the room window is the Shenzhen Bay Bridge with spring bamboo shoots and cocoons. The design of the room is quite special. The bathroom is in the middle of the room and the glass can be controlled electronically~

What I am most satisfied with this time is actually the executive lounge. Whether it is breakfast or dinner, the dishes are constantly being supplemented and updated, and they will not be stopped just because the time is almost up. The sweet potato fries are delicious, delicious hahahaha; The variety of wine tables is also very rich. I am very grateful to Candy and Summer in the Executive Lounge for their enthusiastic service and introduction. The two cocktails they made for us were very delicious. I heard that they are the best in the lounge!

The hotel is seamlessly connected to the subway, which is very convenient; however, the movement line at the gate is mainly designed around vehicles, and the pedestrian movement line does not seem to be particularly reasonable, which is a bit strange haha~

Overall it really exceeded expectations, not bad, not bad hahaha!

The room is thinner than normal, and the waterproof tape in the bathroom is not very waterproof, so there will be water after showering. In addition, I was really disappointed.

The toilet is in a straight position and there is no wind. I suggest that the hotel can face up to the problem. Room amenities are adequate.

The overall environment is very good. We upgraded to a sea view room for free and the sky lobby on the 57th floor has a great view.
The soundproofing of the guest rooms is indeed a bit poor, probably because the glass curtain walls were not sealed properly, and the breakfast options were also limited. Hope it will be better next time. The overall stay experience was good. I will continue to choose Renaissance next time.

msg:We stayed there during the Chinese New Year period for two adults and one child. The hotel is located in the science and technology park and there are relatively few people. There are Line 8 and Line 9 nearby. I think it is better than living in the city and is less noisy. The rooms are all on high floors. You can see Shenzhen Bay and fireworks at night. It is also a very romantic night view. The environment is good. The only three shortcomings are: 1. The breakfast room is a bit small and there are few types of food. 2. Elevator transfer problem. 3. The hotel does not have a small toilet for children, so it is not convenient for children to check in. This is not as good as the hotels in Sanya. Generally speaking, it is recommended because the hotel is relatively new.

I didn't see clearly the room type at first and thought it came with a lounge, but I found out that it was not included, which almost delayed my work schedule. I would like to express my special thanks to Miss Hebe at the front desk for helping me add a lounge, and her service attitude was very good.

The hotel has a high-end appearance. When you get off the bus, you will be helped to open the door to pick up your luggage and lead you all the way into the elevator. The check-in area is on the 57th floor. The view is wide and boundless. You can see spring bamboo shoots and Shenzhen Bay. The room is very clean and tidy. It is best in the evening when you can see the sunset. You can also enjoy the charming night view while taking a bath.

Working and communicating in the executive lounge is definitely a great pleasure, and the service staff in the lounge are very enthusiastic and will proactively ask what drinks you want. After I had a cold and coughed a few times that day, they brought me a pot of hot tea. The hotel's gym and swimming pool are also great. It is recommended to try them out when you have time. The only drawback is that the sound insulation is not very good and you can hear the sound of water pipes. Overall, this trip was very enjoyable and I will recommend it to other friends.

As a corporate employee, I was fortunate enough to experience the comfortable environment of a high-end hotel. This experience gave me a deeper understanding of the design and management of the hotel environment, and also gave me higher expectations for the hotel's service quality and customer experience.
I chose a high-end hotel located in the city center. It has a convenient location and convenient surrounding transportation. It is an ideal choice for business trips and leisure travel. As soon as I walked into the hotel lobby, I was attracted by the spacious and bright space. The comfortable sofas, elegant decoration and warm lighting made people feel relaxed and happy.
The room I stayed in surprised me even more. The room layout is reasonable, the facilities are complete, the warm colors and comfortable furniture make people feel at home. What impressed me even more was that the soundproofing of the room was very good and I was able to rest in a quiet environment without being disturbed by outside noise.
In addition to the hardware facilities, I am also very satisfied with the hotel's service quality. The attitude of the staff is warm and thoughtful. Whether it is the front desk reception or room service, I feel respected and cared for. At the same time, the hotel also provides a wealth of entertainment facilities and fitness equipment, allowing me to relax and have fun after work.
This hotel experience gave me a deeper understanding of the hotel industry and also gave me higher expectations for future hotel experiences. I believe that a good hotel should not only provide a comfortable accommodation environment, but also pay attention to customer needs and experience and provide high-quality services and facilities. Only in this way can we stand out in the fierce market competition and win the trust and loyalty of customers.

Through this experience, I became more aware of the importance of hotel reviews. A fair and objective evaluation can provide consumers with a useful reference and help them make better choices. Therefore, I hope that in future evaluations, all aspects of the hotel, including hardware facilities, service quality, customer experience, etc., can be more comprehensively considered to provide consumers with more accurate and practical information.

All in all, I gained a lot from this hotel experience. Not only did I gain a deeper understanding of the hotel industry, but I also had higher expectations for future hotel experiences. I hope that in my future work, I can continue to pay attention to the development trends of the hotel industry, continuously improve my evaluation and selection abilities, and make greater contributions to the development of the enterprise.

msg:When I arrived at the hotel at around two o'clock in the afternoon, the guest in front of the defendant did not check out and expected to check in at around five o'clock. After repeated requests, I agreed as soon as possible. We arranged to go to the executive lounge, but no one cared about it. It was the worst executive lounge I have ever been to. The most unbelievable arrangement in a five-star hotel! I rushed to the front desk and was finally able to check in at 3:30! The guests next to us have also been unable to check in for this reason. Worst experience ever, bar none

There are several areas for improvement:
1. The toilet in the room is still a traditional one, not an automatic toilet. It is a bit surprising to me in such a new five-star hotel;
2. Although there are not many types of breakfast, everything is delicious. The only thing is that no one cleared the plates in time. There were three empty plates in front of me, but no one came to collect them. It was not until 30 minutes later that someone came to collect them. one time;
3. I wonder if the welcome fruit is only available to VIPs of Renaissance? I saw someone talking about this in the comment area, but this time we didn’t have two rooms.
Overall, I feel that this hotel is pretty good and I will stay there next time.

What's even more amazing is that during this trip, the sound of the person in the next room talking on the phone for a meeting at 1 a.m. sounded like it was coming from your bedside. Fortunately, the hotel reminded this guy and he stopped talking. It was also contemptuous and pitiful. It's a mixed bag. I have to work overtime until early morning during the holidays.

1. My family and I booked two rooms for a total of three nights. When we checked in at the front desk, the staff said that it was difficult to arrange two rooms on the same floor, and that if we arranged two adjacent rooms, we would have to wait. As a result, we took the first room first and then the second room a few hours later.

2. When we checked in, the front desk staff told us that the hotel swimming pool would need to be closed for maintenance for a few days. ￼There is never any notice in this regard when booking online. As a result we couldn't swim.

3. Spoons are never handed out during breakfast in the morning. ￼After asking several times, the waiter found a spoon from nowhere. ￼It is hard to imagine that a five-star hotel would find it difficult to provide ordinary spoons to diners. ￼

From the concierge lobby on the 1st floor to the front desk of the sky lobby on the 57th floor for check-in, as soon as you get out of the elevator, you will see golf balls and the sea view of Shenzhen Bay. , coupled with the good weather, I felt really comfortable and couldn't help but take a few more photos.
Every weekend when I check into several hotels, whether for vacation or business, I will always encounter queues. It is my first time to experience the Renaissance Shenzhen Bay Hotel and it feels very good. First, Tina from the reception team called me in advance to inquire about my arrival time. Like the room and the room, the impression was very good. When I arrived at the front desk, I remembered that Aurora checked me in. It was very fast and professional. Lsa warmly welcomed me to check in. Importantly, there was no need to queue! ! Then he sent me to the elevator to introduce the hotel information. After checking out, I met the lobby manager Tracy, who warmly asked me about my stay. Of course it was great, haha. In short, when visiting Shenzhen this time, staying at the Renaissance Shenzhen Bay Hotel is the best choice. The location is convenient and the transportation is convenient. The rooms are new and well designed. The most important thing is that the service is super good! ! Looking forward to coming again next time.

The shower room is made into a transparent room to make the room look larger. Considering the privacy issue, the glass in the shower room can also be fogged. The second is the clever idea of ​​lighting. When you lie on the big bed and look up, you will see the cute pattern lights in the corner, which makes the room lively.

msg:This is the first time I stayed at Renaissance Shenzhen Bay. It may be newly completed. All the facilities are very clean. The staff at the front desk and the restaurant are very polite and enthusiastic. We even tried the hotel buffet dinner. The food is of good quality, fresh and stylish Rich, delicious breakfast. The whole environment is so bright, the landscape is good, and it stretches as far as the eye can see. But there is a small fly in the oin**ent is the room cleaning service. Since we stayed for two nights in a row, the housekeeper only cleaned the toilet paper and did not replenish the toilet paper and facial tissue. We wore bathrobes and went to the swimming pool and did not give new replacements. There are a few deductions here. , but overall it is still a cost-effective hotel.

The 270-degree viewing hall on the 57th floor can watch the entire Shenzhen Bay. The scenery, Talent Park and Shenzhen Bay Park are not far from the hotel, which is very suitable for going out for a walk. The hotel's buffet is very rich, and dining with beautiful scenery is a very pleasant experience. The hotel service staff was very enthusiastic and considerate. They gave us two free breakfasts for two days, welcome fruit on the first day, and unlimited bottled drinking water in the room.

msg:I arrived at the front desk of the hotel at around 6 pm. The check-in clerk at the front desk said that the check-in information could not be found through my and my husband's names. I could only check the Ctrip order number myself. I was surprised. Why? Maybe it can’t be found! We were traveling with our children, and the hotel seemed to ignore them. They didn't even say hello to them during the entire check-in process. The most exaggerated thing is that we barely spoke to each other during check-in (except for collecting money). What is even more exaggerated is that a five-star hotel does not even introduce the hotel to the guests at the most basic level. I don’t know where the swimming pool is? I don’t know what facilities the hotel has! Don’t know how to park! All in all, I have no favorable impression of the hotel! The service is really bad👎, it’s not like the hotel will contact you in advance as mentioned in the reviews. The most exaggerated thing is that I was given a spa coupon. The check-in attendant gave me the coupon along with the room card. I had no idea where the spa was? How to use the coupon, etc. In short, the experience of staying this time was very bad.

You can hear the loudest speech in the next room. When you turn on the faucet and let out water, you can hear the sound of water pipes. Stayed for two nights and couldn't sleep well. 2. I booked three nights on Ctrip. When I checked in at the hotel, the front desk only found two nights. The first night was not found. After a delay, someone else confirmed that the hotel reservation order was wrong. They said first Check-in is successful only if it is entered into the system, and the experience is not good.
I couldn't stand it anymore after staying for two nights, so I canceled the last night. I really won’t dare to book hotels that are advertised a lot online, they are all fake!

The location is super convenient. It takes less than 10 minutes to reach Vientiane World. Parking. The underground parking lot is convenient. 20 minutes late on weekends to Futian

Facing Shenzhen Bay directly, looking at the wide and deep road along the river when we came here, it is super open and refreshing. The scenery in the morning and evening is great. Look up and a bright moon hangs high in the sky

Thank you Teacher Xu for the casual recommendation. I decided to come here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. I didn't expect the hotel butler to contact me in advance and specially prepared a birthday surprise for me! Also help to note that the front desk is confidential, super considerate

I would like to thank Ms. Santa and Mona with my real names here for ensuring a smooth check-in, solving all needs and problems, upgrading the executive lounge, hand-painted birthday cards, specially selected room types, looking at the sea on both sides, full of surprises and comfort

The high-altitude front desk is already amazing. The boyfriend in the room is super happy hahahaha. I took a lot of photos. The hotel staff are very nice. This stay experience is full of marks 💯 cost-effective second in Shenzhen Bay (the first has not yet been rated hahahahahahahahaha)

The rooms are empty and the materials are cheap. There is almost no sense of design. It feels like a high-end Atour hotel. The most important thing is that the sound insulation is so poor that you can clearly hear people talking in the corridor. I thought the most basic requirement of a hotel is good sound insulation? I am very dissatisfied with the soundproofing. Secondly, the cleaning tools are too smelly. It smells like rags. I will never stay in this shabby hotel again.

msg:There are 2 complaints. 1. The indoor parking lot, the planning is messy, and I stayed for one night. I stopped twice, but each time I didn't stop downstairs at the hotel. I took the children to walk two intersections before arriving at the hotel entrance. I asked the security guard at the gate and didn't tell me which area to stop. If you want to park in the indoor parking lot, remember to ask before parking. 2. Every time you go to the first floor, you must go to the 57th floor to change the elevator to get to the first floor. This is very troublesome.
Facilities: The swimming pool is on the 45th floor, with full marks for landscape and cleanliness. Children can also provide swimming rings, which is very good.
Hygiene: The hygiene of the room is very good, and no problems have been found. As for the sound insulation problem that many people have mentioned, when we usually go on weekends, we will occasionally hear the sound of the faucet in the next room, but we have never heard other sounds. Sound insulation is actually good.
Environment: The lobby is on the 57th floor, and the environment of the room, lobby, and swimming pool is very good.
Service: Except for the security guard on the first floor, everything else is very good.
200 yuan spa voucher: After the discount of this spa is 680 for an hour, I think it is too expensive to go, so I can't comment.
Breakfast: There are many types, it can be regarded as the sky ceiling in the breakfast buffet😜

We only need tenants to do this. I took the room card and showed it to him. Then he became silent. Later, when I was leaving, I went over to remind him that he couldn't talk to guests like this, it was not polite, and the guest experience was very bad. However, he refused to admit it and directly said that it was impossible to talk like this. He also said that we didn't go to the front desk to register or anything, except that we were always at the front desk. He retorted and didn't even say sorry in the end. Does Renaissance Hotel train its staff? Can you work without even knowing basic services? I was unhappy all night, the experience was really bad

The carpet in the corridor is imprinted with splashed ink, which is very artistic. The lights by the door have reflections of birds and leaves, children love to play with these shadows. The bathroom and toilet are separated to achieve a good dry and wet separation. There is a small bathtub in the bathroom, but it is a pity that disposable bathtub covers are not provided. The overall feeling is relatively clean and the facilities are very new. There is a small swimming pool with constant temperature water, and you must wear a swimming cap when swimming!

The service attitude of the hotel staff is very good!

The next day I had a buffet breakfast. If you want to sit by the window and eat while enjoying the scenery, you must have breakfast before nine o'clock. It's hard to get a seat by the window when I go late. Unfortunately, I didn't get a seat by the window. The buffet style is very rich, and the taste is also good, recommended!

There are all office buildings near the hotel, and the subway is easy to find. The front office registration is efficient, better than Zhongzhou Marriott, and they will offer to send fruit. I need to get ice in the afternoon, and the waiter brought it in a big bag, but I accidentally knocked over the floor of the tables and chairs when I placed the insulated bucket, so I called and asked to mop the floor for cleaning. I don’t know if it is during shift hours, and it took half an hour Someone came to deal with it, the ground and the trash can were full of water, the waiter was a little impatient, and it took an hour to deliver the welcome fruit. Secondly, there is an inexplicable melon seed shell at the door of the room? ! From check-in to check-out all the time.
Shenzhen Bay Renaissance’s room size and layout are great. The view is very open. You can directly see the MIXC and China Resources office buildings. The gym on the 45th floor is super big, but the swimming pool usually doesn’t have a small pool. The 200 yuan spa voucher I gave was not used , starting from 500 yuan for spa trea**ent. There are more choices for breakfast than Marriott, but there are also many varieties with average taste.

The place where the force is directly flattened will not rebound, and there are 4 pillows of the same style! There is no room for guests to choose. They slept poorly all night. When turning over, they need to pat the pillows to make them fluffy and supportive. The bedding is really not as good as ordinary three- and four-star chain hotels. They spend four-figure prices for accommodation. But he couldn't even sleep well.
I saw that many reviews mentioned pillows. As a hotel of this price, it only pays attention to decoration and facilities, and ignores the most important bedding for guests to rest. The hotel is located in a high-tech park, and there should be a lot of business people staying in it. If you don't have a good rest, it really has a great impact.
There is also the turndown service. I did not ask for the turndown service. The room service staff knocked on the door a few times around 6:00 p.m. Before I could react to open the door, they pushed the door open and entered, asking if I needed to turn the bed down , it's really a bit scary for a woman staying in a hotel alone.
The sanitation is average. When I checked in, I found that there were still hairs in the bathtub.
At this price, I will still choose the old-fashioned five-star hotels in the future, and I will no longer believe in the so-called Internet celebrity hotels.

msg:📓I saw a lot of reservations for Sheraton and Marriott, and I wanted to book it too, but I was afraid that many people would give up
Finally chose Renaissance Shenzhen Bay Hotel🏨
💁🏻‍♀️ Check-in: The hotel lobby is on the 57th floor. There are quite a lot of people queuing up when you check in, and you can pay directly with coupons
	
💁🏻‍♀️Room: The hotel rooms are basically high-rise, overlooking the night view of Shenzhen Bay🌃 The design in the room is also quite novel, and the environment is okay.
💁🏻‍♀️Food: Afternoon tea☕️Not bad, there are many kinds. The breakfast is also okay, but there are not many surprise dishes, but it is relatively ordinary.
💁🏻‍♀️Facilities: I went to the hotel's swimming pool, the water is cool, I feel cold at first, but I feel okay after going down. The swimming pool is very large and you can see the night view outside🌃
🙅🏻‍♀️Disadvantage: The toilet in the hotel is not smart. For many five-star hotels, this is no different from ordinary hotels. In addition, the TV 📺 cannot be connected to the Internet, which is more traditional. Not very surprised [Smile R] The charging cable in the room is paid for charging, everyone remembers to bring a charger🔋 It’s a bit broken
Generally speaking, the price is okay with coupons

msg:This is the most dissatisfied hotel I have booked for travel in recent years, and I have never given a bad review to any hotel. This year, the mask policy is open and I take children to travel together during the holidays. I don’t know if the hotel has not encountered such a problem in recent years. There are many guests. I checked in at the hotel at 3:00 p.m. and wanted to change clothes at the hotel. The hotel said that there was no clean room yet, so I couldn’t check in and had to wait. They asked me to check in first, saying that I would come later and get the room directly The card is fine, and if you come back at night and you haven't prepared in advance, that's fine. The room is on the 48th floor, next door is a terrace, the room can always hear the sound of the wind blowing, checked the window, can not open, don't know where the sound came from, the whole toilet shakes when the toilet is turned off, the sound is loud, let's talk about breakfast , It’s understandable to queue up. After I went in, I directed the seat. After the waiter put down the sign that I was eating, I went to pick up the meal and came back. I was seated. I asked the staff about the situation and she told me that I needed to reserve a seat. ? At breakfast the next day, I told a service staff member that I would take the children to pick up the food. They didn’t want to collect the food, and they were charged when they came back. Anyway, there were too many people and it was extremely chaotic, and I called the front desk to find the concierge after 11:00 noon. Multiple calls went unanswered. To sum up: the room is not soundproof, the noise is loud, the service force is not enough, and the experience is poor.

The room I stayed in for the first time had a secret door and the sound insulation was not good. After I reacted, I changed the room and did a good job. The birthday arrangement is very favorable, thank you! It is more attentive than Marriott's layout! The room is clean and hygienic, and the glass bathroom has electric control glass that can be adjusted to be transparent and opaque! The taste of breakfast is slightly inferior to that of Marriott, and the variety is also less. My favorite swimming pool is not open. It's a pity!
Disadvantages: The windows in the room are cracked, there is a strong wind at night, and there is always a howling wind. I was woken up in the middle of the night and tried various methods, but I couldn’t get it right. It made me sleep and dream like blowing strong winds in the ice and snow🤣

msg:1. Food delivery problem: The hotel needs to go to the 57th floor before transferring to the 1st floor; the hotel does not allow food delivery to the front desk on the 57th floor, and there is no hotel intelligent robot service. Guests are required to dress themselves, go from the 57th floor to the 1st floor, and go out to the takeaway counter outside the hotel. The service level is relatively backward, and the experience is extremely poor.
2. No Internet TV: The hotel TV only has cable TV channels and cannot be connected to the Internet. The equipment is backward, unimaginable!
3. Room design: The entrance of some rooms is narrow (as shown in the picture), and the wall is visible when you go out. The design is unreasonable.
4. The environment of the hotel parking lot is poor: It can be understood that it is a public parking lot of the building. It is recommended to repackage the special parking spaces for the hotel. In addition, this door is hard to find. I thought it was an escape route between the stairs. First impressions are important
5. Delayed check-out problem: I return to the hotel in the morning for personal reasons and it is close to 12:00, and I hope to delay the check-out by 1 hour. Call the hotel front desk, after a long time, feedback "You need to check out at 12 o'clock". Maybe Ctrip Platinum does not meet the standard, and I don't know what customers can meet the conditions for late check-out. Generally, hotels who stayed in the past will be considerate and agree to delay appropriately.
6. Hygienic problems in the room: washing the bathtub by hand, I feel that the wall of the bathtub is dirt or something. .

Of course, the hotel also has good aspects: the interior space of the room is relatively large, the surrounding city landscape is better, and the buffet service is more enthusiastic.

Areas for improvement:
Hygiene advice should be well requested. The hair dryer still has the hair of the previous guest. I don't think such a problem should occur in a star-rated hotel.

In order to find a more private hotel to propose marriage, I trot around nearly ten luxury hotels in Nanshan and Futian. I always wanted to relive the environment of a hotel in Beijing with my girlfriend. The suite room type of Renaissance Shenzhen Bay Hotel is the most satisfactory choice. Afterwards, my fiancee also praised the environment. I am very satisfied with my choice, and I am very fortunate.
Aaron learned that I was proposing marriage, and gave us a bottle of red wine to cheer us up. During the period, he learned that I needed to carry out some links in the restaurant, and actively communicated and coordinated with the restaurant manager Yang. During the whole process, I felt the professionalism and dedication of the Renaissance service team. Looking forward to meeting you next time! thank you all!

The hotel is located on the high floor of Shenzhen Bay, and you can see Hong Kong on the other side from the window.
It's a pity that the room with the view of the bamboo shoots could not be arranged on the day of check-in.
The swimming pool is a bit strange, you have to go through two escape doors to enter, which is a strange design.
The service and hygiene are above the standard.

When I finally booked on Ctrip, there was a 200 yuan spa voucher, but it was not given to me when I checked in.

Here we need to praise the warm, polite and professional attitude of the front desk ella👍👍 and the housekeeping depar**ent Sam who is tireless and responsible, and the customer service phone lady is meticulous, patient and tireless. Thank you for providing quality service to me and my children! ! !

During the holidays, the rooms are full, and the rooms with the "best view" and the swimming pools that want to go into the water but cannot swim are "overcrowded". I have regrets...

The hardware facilities of the hotel are good and very new, but there is still a smell of decoration in the room. The bed is obviously a little high (worry that the child will fall off and get injured), the two single beds and the sofa cannot be close together, and there is movement at the door of the room around 4 am, The surrounding piling is very noisy in the morning and other problems...

Give a five-star praise, look forward to the next stay, can experience better 😃

The hotel's epidemic prevention measures are very good, and it takes 48 hours to enter with a negative nucleic acid result

I chose the deluxe double room. This room type is not for the bamboo shoots.
Floor-to-ceiling glass is comfortable
The layout and furnishings in the room are also good
It is very considerate that there are different kinds of fruits.
-
The disadvantage is that the exhaust fan is only available in the bathroom, and there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom
This is not perfect from the point of view of the check-in experience.

The 57th floor is the check-in lobby
There is also a bar open at night
Lots of choices for buffet breakfast
Both Chinese, Western and Japanese styles are available. I think knife-cut noodles are delicious.
The soup base has a peppery taste, and it tastes very special

There are Courtyard and Renaissance in the hotel garage, don't read it wrong
Remember to enter the license plate number on the 1st floor before leaving the store

Check-in is very easy, the western restaurant is monotonous or self-service, the taste is online ~ you can see the scenery and night view of the entire Shenzhen Bay at night~
Located in the Ecological Science and Technology Park, get up early and go downstairs to make a nucleic acid. It only takes 1 minute to queue up. Then go to the ecological promenade of the Dasha River for a stroll, and it will be noon in a blink of an eye.

The front desk is on the 57th floor, which is more private, and no strange people will appear in the lobby.

Probably because the epidemic has not yet completely subsided, there are not many guests, we originally arrived late, and the ordinary twin room has been upgraded to a bay view room on the 52nd floor.

Because I brought a small pot friend, I called the front desk to ask for small slippers, and the front desk took the initiative to offer fruits, small bathrobes and a small pot friend's bath set (shower gel, shampoo, body milk, toothbrush, toothpaste, bear-shaped soap), super cute, small Pot friends put it down.

The swimming pool is on the 45th floor. It is not big, about 4 lanes wide. There are very few people, but the temperature is slightly lower and it feels a bit cold.
The heated pool is on the 45th floor at the end of the spa, and you need to walk over after swimming. Opposite the swimming pool is a small gym, so I didn't go in because there was no demand.
The men and women in the warm water pool were separated, and it was refreshing to go back to the room to rest after soaking in red. There is a steam room but it is not open?
There are plenty of showers over the heated pool, as well as a dryer for drying swimsuits.
Spa did not go to experience.

Ctrip points late check-out until 2:00, the next day is more calm.

The quilt was a little thick and it was hot at one point at night.

The weather is not good, the beauty of Shenzhen Bay can not be seen, it is foggy.

The overall facilities of the hotel are very new, the decoration is not old-fashioned at all, the bathrobes are relatively new, the shower gel and the like are also very smelly, and the attitude of the service staff is also quite good. This time, I didn't book a room with breakfast, and I didn't experience the hotel buffet. Let's try again next time.

Choosing a hotel still depends on the big brands. This Renaissance is one of the most expensive in the Renaissance. It is about the same price as JW, Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, etc. I feel that the bath is more special, so I came here to stay, but I am really disappointed. .
1. The four pillows in the room are all very flat, and the two cushions are too short together, which is very uncomfortable. Generally, it should be equipped with at least 2 thick + 2 flat.
2. The room is particularly stuffy. Turning on the air conditioner to 16°C to adjust the maximum air volume is also stuffy, and there is a smell in the room.
3. The newly opened hotel is equipped with an old TV. The screen is small and cannot be projected. There is no independent movie mode, and you can only watch its own TV channels.
4. There is no general control in the room to turn off all lights, and the bathroom is independent, which is more troublesome.
5. The sound insulation is average. In the morning, you will always hear the knocking on the door and the footsteps upstairs.
6. Except for the front desk, other services are not up to the standard. If you call without a charging cable, it means that a room can only be given a three-port line. The security guard also reminds you that you must check out and return it to the room. No, otherwise you lose 200. Breakfast service: arrived at the door at 9:45 and told me bluntly that there was only fifteen minutes left for meal time, even if it was a kind reminder, the tone and manner made people feel unpleasant. When I got up to get my meal, half of the plates and knives and forks on the table were taken away, but the egg rolls that I had not eaten were left. what to do?
I have stayed in all Shenzhen hotels, and there is another one on the Never Again List. With a price of 1k+ jw per night, I feel like I have stayed in an ordinary Renaissance (the scenery is still okay), and I will not step on thunder in the future.

msg:All to the worst, just to attract attention to the complaint!
The worst Renaissance and star hotel I have ever stayed in! ! !
1 Check-in at 2-3 pm. There are 2 check-in counters on the 57th floor. A total of three people including me checked in. Then I waited for more than ten minutes. . . What speed is this? ? !
2 went out to eat and left luggage at the concierge on the first floor. When I came back to pick it up, I waited for more than ten minutes. There was no one at the concierge on the first floor, or the little girls from other depar**ents next to me called me to urge someone from the front desk and the concierge to come quickly, and the guests were waiting to pick up their luggage.

What kind of rotten star is this, the worst Renaissance I have ever stayed in!

🔔Service: The most impressive thing is the service. The service is great! Every employee I met was very kind and polite, including the reception staff at the entrance and exit on the first floor, the front desk staff at the check-in and check-out on the 57th floor, the cleaning staff on the floor, the service staff in the fitness center, the staff in the restaurant, and the administrative staff. Each of the Cocos at the level is professional and kind, and must be manually liked.

🍃Environment: The view of the lobby on the 57th floor is very good. The restaurant where you have breakfast, the view is quite good. The gym and swimming pool are also very good👍👍👍

Breakfast: There are many choices, and I hope to keep it~ The seats are spacious and the Shenzhen Bay view is superb.

The welcome fruits and toiletries provided by Ctrip Platinum members are very warm, thank you!

msg:In the new hotel of the Science and Technology Park, the entrance is not so obvious and easy to find, but the simple and bright design fits the positioning of the Science and Technology Park. The hotel is very new, and the bedding and bath products are comfortable, which is very important. There is no capsule coffee machine equipped with hand-made hanging ear coffee, but it also provides some convenience for business guests. After staying for two nights, it is a pity that I did not experience more facilities when I was busy. The room is near the elevator entrance. Some noises were heard in the morning. It's worth noting.

msg:Room view:
The room can see the entire Shenzhen Bay, and there are spring bamboo shoots. When the view is quite wide, the glass is quite dirty.

Location traffic:
The traffic is very convenient, one or two kilometers away from Vientiane World. There are taxis, buses, and subways nearby. The location mark is not obvious. When the evening arrived, I went around and couldn't find it. Many drivers confuse Renaissance with the Courtyard opposite.

Room facilities:
The layout of the room is unreasonable. In the bathroom, the wet and dry separation zone is like a maze. It also causes a waste of space. Unreasonable and unattractive.
Gym:
The gym facilities are very complete, and there are pool spas. When I went there at 7 o'clock in the morning, there was still not even a staff member on duty.
breakfast:
The breakfast is rich, Japanese, Chinese and Western. But as Guangdong, congee, noodles and rice should be the best. But that porridge seems to be ripened, and if you add preserved eggs or beef, it doesn't taste at all. in addition. Why is the variety of breakfast on Friday and Saturday not stable? The side dishes on Fridays, pork floss, salted eggs, and Japanese squid rings, are gone on Saturday~
Generally speaking, there are not too many impressive places for the 1,800-priced hotel. It is a business hotel.

msg:🍃Environment:
It is a sky lobby with a very good environment and good aroma, but it’s a bit troublesome to get off the parking lot. You have to change three elevators.
The bar next to the lobby has a very good environment, and the night view with lights is very beautiful at night.
The room is relatively spacious. Outside the window is the building group on the right and the bay on the left. The view is nice.

🔔Service:
The attitude of the staff is very good. The staff in the bar on the lobby floor had a very good attitude. They closed and rested at about 12 o'clock in the evening. After ordering the juice, they helped me think about membership points and discounts.
Welcome fruit on the first day.
But I booked the turndown every day, only on the day of the reservation, there is no later 😕
There are many kinds of breakfast, but the girls went to eat alone, and the waiter never asked if they wanted coffee; when the boys went with, the waiter would help pull the chair and ask what they want to drink 😕

msg:（因為酒店定位緣故，本文撰寫時已調整要求，請自行斟酌。）

酒店位置方便，正在地鐵9號線高新南站上蓋，不過附近是高新工業區，所以沒有很多商場可逛。在這裡入住的話，主要是享用酒店設施。

先說好的體驗。房間走廊設計走自然風，燈光秀上燕子和樹木，格調令人感到放鬆。內部景觀開揚，空間感足夠，三邊下床空間十足。

員工很有心去提供服務，我們在午飯時間點了**，但技術問題沒法打開智能櫃，員工親自協助打電話解決問題，對談過程感受到積極應對。晚上健身房外值班員工知道我還沒出來，會主動告訴女友再等一會兒。

房間燈光和擺設均令人舒適，內裡有電動遮光板和電窗簾。不過好像只能全開和全關。

以下內容包含一些不好的體驗要留意
健身室、泳池和水療中心與房間一樣面向深圳灣。健身室每部器材都放了一瓶水，方便使用人士，還播放動感音樂，令人投入，水療中心有熱水池浸泡，不過更衣室裡邊人手不太足夠去收拾，梳妝枱有髮絲沒有即時處理。泳池恒溫，坐位足夠。

談一下房間，很多瘕疵要收拾，大家可以看圖，主要集中在衞浴。洗面鏡上有銹跡難以接受，廁所牆上有水泥跡。作為國際五星品牌，這些情況應時常檢查。

早餐時分，收拾速度不足，我們出去拿下一輪美食時候，沒有即時拿走光盤。

因為是生日，他們有心的擺設，但「生日快樂」的燈箱有兩個是沒電的，要我主動去要求換電，體驗不完美。

雖然總會留意缺點，但整體來說還是挺滿意住宿。

連續出差15天，整個人都emo了，但是一個好的酒店真的可以給人回家般的温暖

之前在深圳住了幾晚萬麗，非常非常滿意，從香港出差回來又續訂了，巧的是又遇到可愛甜美的前台小姐姐Michelle（希望我沒有記錯名，哈哈哈）

酒店旁邊有一個萬象天地，走路15-25分鐘左右，好吃好喝都有！很方便

去機場也近！打車30多分鐘

Anyway！推薦推薦 五星好評

msg:1、酒店在深圳灣附近，從機場出發到酒店大約四十分鐘左右，地鐵口出來就是酒店，非常方便。入住前一天，前台會主動電話問有無過節日、房型等特殊需求。
2、入住後，前台小姐姐幫我們做了upgrade，風景絕美，窗户也擦的十分乾淨，看深圳灣毫無遮擋。
3、在酒店吃的早飯，選品很豐富，可惜沒有拍照。味道還可以，十點半結束，建議早點去哈，去的晚了人多，早飯的對窗的風景也相當好，心曠神怡。
4、泳池也有，不過沒去踩點，所以不評價啦。
唯一不足就是可能房間隔音有一點差。
總體還是相當相當滿意的，價格也比較適中，超預期。

另外特別之處是服務員的綜合素質高，值得點贊

但酒店前台、禮賓部、客房部的工作人員態度都非常好，沒有下載叫車軟件，禮賓部的工作人員主動幫忙叫車，並且還護送我們上車，非常貼心。客房部的工作人員也會主動打招呼，和小朋友聊天。早上睡晚了也完全不會打擾！讚👍 房間清潔也非常乾淨。
客房設計時尚，非常喜歡洗澡區域的設計，干湿分離做的很好。香港的風筒、插電器直接插頭就行，不需轉換，好方便！
但客房的冷氣設置不太好，隔音也一般，隔壁聊天、放水聲都聽得到，吵到休息了。但這是酒店設計問題，總體來說非常值得入住的。

在登記的時間有一段小插曲，我在登記快完成的時候發現不見了快2歲的兒子，當下很著急，很快在另一邊的餐廳找到他，他太皮了四處走，當時酒店大堂沒什麼人，我轉身時有2名員工在我後面聊天，卻看不到他跑哪去了，員工培訓可加強，但是態度是很好的，只是有點不足。
房間很大，浴室是可霧屏的透明盒子，浴缸打卡一流。服務很好，需要的都能提供。
其他酒店設施沒嘗試，有機會會再去。

進了房間，發現枕頭有污漬。下午在房間用餐完放在門口的餐具第二天早上才收走。打掃房間的時候沙發上小孩子用的寢具也不管收拾。
客觀講，也有做的還可以的方面: 就一家四口來説，酒店雙床的房間面積還可以。早餐也還豐富，粉面腸粉啥的也都有，聖誕夜還給每間客服用聖誕襪子送了糖果。酒店一樓的禮賓服務還蠻OK。
但無論如何，心裏留下了陰影，下次不想再住了。

先説缺點：下午四點半到店時告知我房間還沒有收拾好，於是和朋友在酒廊等了一個多小時；第二天吃早餐時被告知餐廳沒有位置了需要排隊（可能本人酒店住的不夠多但真的沒有遇到過這種情況）

再説優點：酒店大堂和餐廳景觀很好；房間很大很寬敞，不枉等了這麼久，可惜不是灣景；晚上另一個朋友也來聚會請前台多拿一床被子也很快就送到了，第二天吃早餐去購買額外一位時被告知已經安排了三位免費（這一點我很驚訝也很感激，説明前台工作人員很用心）；自助餐選擇不算特別多但味道不錯；酒店離地鐵站也很近。

總體來説是一次瑕不掩瑜的體驗，朋友也特別滿意，以後在南山辦事還會選擇這家酒店。

2.床和枕頭都非常不舒服
3.9：30到餐廳需要排隊，單人拼桌會快點。早餐還算豐富，但中式的菜品味道一般
4.充電樁很多但全是交流電，新款電車充不了。
入住其他沒什麼問題，最熱情服務最好的是1樓的小夥伴，感謝

msg:上次來深圳還是為了去香港路過，酒店坐落於深圳灣科技園核心地帶，客房分佈46-56層，房間視野幾乎無遮擋，洗漱用品是萬麗標配的Argus By Margot Elena。酒店距離萬象城世界之窗歡樂海岸都很近，所以在這裏不論是體驗城市創意生活空間還是追求娛樂感官刺激，各種各樣的旅行需求都能滿足。行政酒廊位於酒店55層，這裏的風景相當不錯，白天和夜晚各有不一樣的美景等着。晚間歡樂時光出品尚可，這家酒水種類提供還是挺豐富的，也有很多雞尾酒可以給客人調製。特別是行政酒廊的經理santa 和主管summer。兩位都非常的專業。相信下次來深首選也是它

入住前一天，管家santa打電話詢問有什麼特別需求，添加了微信方便後期溝通，小寶寶用品也都提前準備好在房間內。
我們來的時候人不多，直接給我們安排了面朝深圳灣海景的房間，風景很好。
管家服務特別及時，事事有着落件件有迴應，我提前跟他説的事情我都忘了她還記得，真的很細心。前台電話也是秒接，服務員上問大家快。
整個酒店的環境很温馨，適合家庭入住。
整體符合我的預期，相當滿意

酒店在46樓以上，所以整體視野還是很棒的，可以很直接很深刻地感受到深圳這座城市帶來的視覺沖擊，平地而起，一代又一代的年輕人在這裏付出青春，揮灑努力的汗水。下次回來繼續選擇他

msg:已經是第二次入住了，比較失望，因為第一次入住讓我很驚喜，而且上一次也同是假期，不明白為何服務態度差了這麼多，一點到酒店想辦理入住，當時前台只開了兩條隊伍，兩個隊伍也只有一個客人在辦理，但是很久都沒有辦理成功，也沒有關係￼，但忽然之間有一個服務員走到一個新的前台櫃位，她也沒有示意我可以上前辦理，於是我繼續在自己的隊伍等待，但是突然間有一個新的客人剛剛出電梯，你們的服務員竟然叫他們先辦理入住，我站在這裏這麼久，如果是新開可以辦理入住的櫃位，為什麼不叫我先辦理？後來在我說了幾句之後新開的櫃位的同事有讓我先行辦理，但是辦理入住的服務員也是沒有熱情笑容，如果這是其他酒店店我覺得可以理解，但是作為奢華酒店我就覺得有欠熱情，而且由於我是在平台上購買用了積分兌換延遲到下午兩點退房，於是我希望確認一下，誰知服務員語氣有點鄙視像是以為我要問他延遲退房，並回答我是中午12點，要我提醒才知道我在平台上兌換的，然後他要我出示證明平台是有兌換，這是沒有問題的，但是期間不停向我要求先給按金，我就覺得奇怪了，先搞好一切資料及手續才給按金不是正常的嗎？為什麼着急地向我收按金？給我的觀感很差。最後你們讓其他客人先排隊的同事有注意到這個問題，後來有跟我道歉並有送上紀念品，也是值得欣賞，但是如果一開始有留意這個問題，客人的感受會好很多，也給人專業的感覺，但是這次令我有點失望，與上一次的感覺相差太遠了。而且我在一點辦理入住還沒有準備好房間，前台說如果有房間準備好會聯絡我，但是並沒有，要我自己到三點的時候再打電話到酒店問。最後想說一下你們的房間的風筒真是太差了，不論是上一次的房間還是今次的房間，那個插頭的位置非常容易掉下來，經常吹着頭便因那個插頭掉下來停了，非常不方便，而且冷氣不足，雖然可以最低調到16度，但是環境仍然是20度左右，我住了兩天兩天都是流着汗醒來的，不知道你們有沒有辦法改善，但就是想說一下￼。

開車停車樓下有停車場，但出去前要先去酒店大堂和前台服務員説，有效時間衹有15分鐘，這個比較麻煩些，如果有東西需要搬去房間，可以和樓下工作人員説一聲，他們可以直接幫忙拉上去，真的很謝謝他們！

酒店整體位置於45樓層高以上，尤其外牆設有白色航空障礙閃燈。

入夜後，明顯很受閃光响影！原因是窗簾遮光幕不厚而抵擋不起強光照射，房內仍會受光，閃光更是容易引發哮喘病發作的原因之一！

上下樓層的隔音完全是零水準！
原因沒有地毯，簡約木板設計，上層拉動行李喼，拉椅，踏步聲，大聲對話，完全清晰清楚！
連浴室都可傳來沖水聲，一分驚喜！差點誤以為**經過！

房內有夜燈3支，足夠光量，入睡前必要熄掉，絕不能長著…

近地鐵出口，方便！但站內未有標示提供！

房間很新，海景房可以遠遠看到深圳灣。唯一不足就是樓層太高，室外噪音有點大。酒店另外有點麻煩的就是要換電梯，高峯期等電梯有點點慢。

早餐很豐富。

健身房和泳池也不錯。

作為萬豪酒店會員，對於這次入住體驗可以説是非常非常差。酒店團隊散漫不作為。辦事效率低下。希望整頓整個管理團隊和工作人員。

       早餐廳風景很美！可以看見海和珠港澳大橋！早餐品種也挺豐富！該有的都有了！酒店服務不夠專業！
      總之，第一次住萬麗。體驗感不怎樣！果斷換酒店！這個價格還不如去萬豪，品質至少能保證！

msg:酒店環境是很好的，一入酒店大堂服務員態度也很好，叫我們都57樓check-in, 上到去要排兩個，職員又指示我們到55樓check-in, 結果在55樓等了40分鐘才可check-in, 但前面只有一人在登記，服務員攪了很久才完成。到我們check-in 服務聲稱幫我們upgrade了房間在48樓，我到房發現貨不對版，房型超奇怪，還有最特式的透明浴缸竟變了在厠所內，石屎牆，沒有窗沒有玻璃，結果我們又回到55樓跟服務員說房型不對，結果她給我們換了55樓（我們訂了的那種房型）。結果用了1小時15分鐘才能入到房，但其實一啲都唔多人。我只等一個，真不知道多人他們怎麼辨。

還有，酒店電梯非常不方便，每次想到其他樓層都要先到57樓轉電梯。還有，登記時服務員沒有跟我們說有free lounge, 是我在trip.com看到大家的留言才知道的（謝謝大家），但知道已經太晚，所以沒有享用過不知好壞。

還有，登記時服務員說會說生果盤，結果沒有說來，我亦忘記了，另外，叫他們拿拖鞋亦等了1個小時，打了3次電話才送來！！

另外，泳池原來是要用游泳帽及不可用酒店拖鞋，酒店可以買￥88一頂（沒有牌子的）。要去的請自己準備。

總括而言，酒店服務超差，景觀美的也不只他一家酒店，所以我不會再去這間酒店了，太浪費時間！

The hotel's beds are uncomfortable, the design is strange, the staff's service attitude is poor, and the overall service awareness is not up to the standard. The service staff felt inattentive. The sanitation was not cleaned in time, there was no sign of the guest's vomit on the ground, the ground was wet and slippery, which caused the child to fall into other people's vomit, the manager on duty at night just apologized and washed our clothes before it was over. , We were very dissatisfied with the result of this trea**ent, until we resolutely checked out the next day. The management staff of the entire hotel is not capable enough to deal with emergencies, and it is not enough to meet the service standards of the Renaissance Hotel!

msg:這可能是住過最差的五星酒店之一，首先聲明我是對照香港萬麗酒店的體驗，香港萬麗在我印象中絕對是老牌高端酒店的典範，不是頂級富人酒店，但是是那種規規矩矩不犯錯但是有常有小驚喜的五星酒店。
但是深圳這個萬麗都讓我感覺這是萬麗嗎？風格都完全不一樣，難道是套牌？真的是槽點滿滿，整個感覺就是設計師/設計團隊都是吃x的嗎？這樣的酒店居然攜程排深圳最具設計感第6名？
我先説説優點再吐槽缺點：
優點：
1. 選址很好，晚景很美；
2. 酒店在46-56層，高層看景不錯；
缺點：
1. 酒店入口在連體建築內部，造成入口很昏暗，外面沒有顯著特色提醒我這裡是萬麗酒店；
2. 進入酒店大堂，整個大堂跳高至少六七層樓高，大廳有一個應該是禮賓台的地方，但是沒有客人休息的地方，整個入口大廳顯得空空盪盪，冷冷清清，給人感覺像進了廢棄的辦公樓；
3. 然後那個一共三個電梯上到57樓酒店大堂：
 a. 電梯等待時候感覺偏長，b. 速度倒是不慢，也沒有耳鳴感，c. 但是電梯電視循環播放一個動感廣告，聲音有點大，讓整個電梯搭乘時間非常煎熬折磨，整個過程同一個廣告可能能循環三次左右，可以想象一天搭乘幾次是什麼體驗嗎？ d. 電梯內燈光昏暗，是真昏暗而不是那種高級的光感。五六個色彩和位置都很雜亂的好多安全標識什麼的，一下子破壞掉整個電梯的氣氛
4. 57樓大堂，早餐廳就在前台旁邊。可以看到灣景，但是並沒有正常五星酒店那種大堂會客區。
5. 客房在57層往下，46-56層，需要搭乘另外一部電梯下去，但是45層是健身房，我就想問，為什麼不能酒店大堂剛在45，大家再搭乘電梯上去？這樣既浪費大家時間又浪費能源的設計，這幫**是怎麼想到的？而且事實上可以從客房直接到45層健身房樓層再換乘上來那部電梯下到1樓，沒試過可不可以換到45樓上到客房，但是電梯裏指示住客是要去57樓換乘下1樓
6. 酒店裝修整體風格有點像亞朵，不合時宜和亮度的燈光，淺色木地板裝修，走廊

槽點太多，寫到一半覺得沒興趣寫下去了，總之當時感覺這個價位住萬麗太值了，但是現在覺得除了名字哪哪都不像萬麗酒店。

最後甚至忘記把證件還我
前台發現第一時間也不是通知我
而是自顧自的找人送到房間裏？
1. 如果我在房間就算了 我不在房間呢？工作人員隨意進出嘛？
2. 還送錯了房間 我發現了去前台問才去找人取回來？
這一系列就是迷之操作….
 還有酒店地下停車場居然不直通酒店？我要到旁邊的辦公園區上到一樓再步行到酒店？這也很迷
如果酒店電梯可以直達（反正我沒找到）那標識就很有問題………….

自助早餐分為西式、日式、傳統中式、粵式、新融合等。值得一試的是腸粉、奶酪、烘焙、秋刀魚、肥牛、蛋酪……
房屋中間的浴缸很有特色，尤其是晚上關燈之後……
55層是行政酒廊，方便組織一些商務活動，特別表揚一下Summer女士和另外一位男士，解決了我着急打印的問題。
房間內有一個很高級的電熨斗，晚上在房間裏自己洗衣服熨好後第二天正好穿，早知道就帶換洗的內衣襪子就好了。

然後除了擁有公共場所（泳池 健身）其他方面跟四五百的沒啥區別了……
定的海景房也沒啥看點，窗外望去一半是建築一般是高爾夫球場…
最奇葩的是第一次遇到吃早餐自助餐要排隊？？？！沒有安排小零食沒有椅子沒有水，就站着在那乾等….
然後自助餐很多食物都沒有了也沒有繼續供應！
工作人員服務態度還是可以的，談話都友好。
整體來講 個人認為不值這個價格。

入住後：躺在床上都能看到馬桶，就像廁所裏放張床一樣，格局非常奇怪。提出換房間，等了一天也沒有任何回覆！隔音也很差，每天都被旁邊打掃房間的吸塵器聲音吵醒！還有點外賣不讓外面員進來ok，那麼要麼派人要麼讓機器人送也可行，保安衹會説外賣員不讓進，保安也不能上大堂。必須讓客人自己下去拿，又要坐電梯上到大堂然後換另外的電梯下去，既然這麼麻煩就應該為客人想出合適的解決方案！
退房：一大早就打電話一定讓人兩點退，問能不能延後一個小時，來來回回也衹會説兩點系統自動收半天房費其他什麼都不會説。住過萬豪那麼多酒店，三四點退房從來沒有遇到任何問題！
總結：服務態度衹是標準的，不能解決任何實質性問題的話也是廢物。房間也不咋地，同等價位隨便的酒店都可以吊打！非常辣雞以後絕不會再住！！

msg:本來是溜娃出來旅行，把深圳作為了中轉站，各方看了推薦最後入住的深圳灣萬麗酒店。總體評價差許多意思，設施設備跟商務酒店差不多（估計跟在深圳金融商業圈寫字樓周圍有關係），大堂設在57樓但是1樓沒有相應的指引，至是有個招牌顯示這裏確實是酒店的進入口。去房間需要在57樓大堂轉電梯間才能到酒店所屬的樓層，然後如果要去地下車庫需要先從房間的四部電梯轉到57樓，然後再轉到一樓，再然後去旁邊的電梯間下到停車場。全過程折磨人的心態。房間內部空調是擺設，打電話詢問，告知目前衹能制熱，製冷主機沒打開，建議我們開通風選項，結果隨便哪個選項都是無風，工程維修倒是來得挺快，十分鐘的修整，有一點微風了，但是温度根本下不來，而且由於樓層高，所有玻璃窗户都是密閉狀態，小朋友一直喊熱，關鍵晚上睡覺明顯鼻子已經堵了，完全不通風透氣造成的。其它的設施設備根本沒有豪華酒店的特色和亮點，除了一點，電視打開很多英文和他國語言的頻道，這個是高端酒店的標配。退房退按金倒挺快的。重點就是我們開始辦理入住的心得體會了：首先我們是兩家人四大兩小選擇了灣景標間房型，確實酒店的雙床都是目前住過最大尺寸的床型，這也是我們選擇重要原因。我們一家人上午十一點左右先到，大廳設在了寫字樓的57層，俗稱空中大廳走廊，確實景色還行，都是高樓大廈，有部分海灣景色，前台告知本來是下午三點才能辦理入住，看我們帶小孩先給我們開一間（訂房期間再三跟攜程客服要求兩間房要相鄰房間，客服答應儘量），説另一間房就隔了一個房間，將心比心雖然不能理解為什麼要下午三點才能開房間，我花一天的房費衹能住21小時嗎？你們怎麼不把退房時間也延遲到三點呢？但是前台這樣説還是很貼心，也表示另一間房還處於臟房狀態，我們也表示朋友一家人要三點後才來影響不大，然後把兩間房的按金交了，囑咐前台朋友來報名字或者房號直接按程序登記入住。結果開始揪心的事就接踵而至了，嚴重影響了我們對深圳的遊玩心情和深圳灣的期待了。首先朋友三點半後到前台被告知房間還沒打掃出來，先又多交了一間房按金登記但是沒有拿房卡，然後喊等待，房間好了電話告知。結果四十分鐘過去了打電話詢問也是説的沒有打掃好，詢問了回電話。又是半小時過去了詢問前台還是這樣推諉，好像你們萬豪旗下的酒店前台是前台，客房服務是客房服務，你們都是獨立運營的機構一樣，完全沒有責任心。期間我們多次到所謂的隔壁臟房查看，一直處於關閉狀態，也沒客房服務員在打掃的意思。最後過了兩小時多，我們直接到前台，前台美女説的不好意思，不確定房間目前衞生情況什麼時候能好我們給你換到其它樓層的行政雙床房（所謂的房型升級），先不説你們早幹什麼去了，關鍵換過去的不同樓層房間跟我們訂的房間一模一樣，這樣赤裸裸的無視客人的需求，欺騙客人的智商，我能客觀的給你們衞生三星，環境三星已經是仁至義盡了。至少你們的做法讓我們對豪華型酒店品牌萬豪都產生了不信任了，就不説還住不住你們酒店了，強烈不推薦。視頻是客觀美化製作的，僅供欣賞。

早餐：種類還算可以，很好吃！最愛薯角！豆沙包、蒸南瓜、炒麪都挺好吃的！不過餐廳位置不算多，9點半的時候就開始排隊了
衞生：水龍頭上還有水漬，浴巾上有頭髮，讓我有點懷疑整個酒店的衞生……

但辦理入住速度很慢，等很久。因為春節人多早餐排隊超過二十多分鐘。最不太能理解的是，五星級酒店難道不應該是全天泳池嗎，這難道不是必須有的服務嗎，如果是泳池維修完全不能用可以理解，但是泳池衹能下午開始到晚上這確實不懂。服務人員説是外包的，可是酒店是否外包泳池跟客人好像沒有關係呀。一千多一晚是不貴，但很多細節確實讓人不覺得這是個五星級酒店。

msg:大年初一入住～
在地下停車場停好車，但指引上酒店的電梯確實不清晰，第一次從隔壁樓上去了，後來專門開車慢慢兜，才找到直通酒店的小門。
由於從另一棟樓出來了，於是從酒店大堂進入，旋轉門，走兩步就卡住了。一位大堂哥哥和一位大堂叔叔冷漠地在旁邊用手勢讓我們走前走後，大概弄了個半分鐘吧，門才動起來。走出來後我問大堂叔叔為啥門的感應這麼不好，嗯，冷漠無比，眼睛都不看我，一句話不説。導致一到酒店的感覺非常差！
電梯到57樓前台，前台小姐姐從頭到尾沒有一句“你好”“新年好“歡迎光臨”。其他流程順暢。
第二天早餐，種類和口味一般般吧。
中午退房，到晚上也沒收到退按金的短訊。於是晚上八點多打電話到酒店問，説可能因為太忙了，沒來得及操作。掛掉電話之後，秒退了。
點評的之後才發現訂房費裏麪包含一個209元水療代金券，全程沒見過沒問過沒提過耶………

msg:不是一次最好的萬麗酒店入住經歷。在checkin 的時候，專門問那個前台西裝小哥，房間有沒有courtesy upgrade （入住率也就40% 不到），小哥頭也不抬的回覆："沒有“。我問的原因，國慶節期間，就是對房間景觀有一定的期望，深圳灣，hello。。。。好了，填了一堆表，給了我房卡，我大包小包的坐電梯去到房間樓層，開門進去，發現窗户對着一大片廠房，城中村。。。。我隨即打電話給前台：“為什麼不offer 一間看深圳灣景觀的房間（occupancy 也就40+% 不到），我剛才專門還起了這個話頭，問你”，電話那端，這才告訴我“ 要看海景，要加200塊。。。。”。 

我在入住的時候，為什麼穿筆挺西裝的小哥，不告訴我差價？頭也不抬的就在敲鍵盤。。。這是一次很不舒服的經歷。Renaissance 是一家非常棒的國際酒店。在國外生活，出差，都是首選。很遺憾，來到中國後，酒店的管理，HR資源，也就天朝化了。。。。3星差評。

￥200差價我給了，一身汗的，跑上跑下，我也換了房間。下次還會不會選擇入住深圳灣萬麗酒店。Absolutely No.
