We put two mattresses together, which is super big and super comfortable. Disadvantages: there are no children's toothbrushes and slippers, and the hygiene is not good. Overall, I am satisfied. Finally, I strongly recommend the mutton in Youyu, which is very delicious.

When I came back at night, I was told that the hot water boiler was broken and there was no backup or plan. The water in all the rooms was muddy and yellow. I thought it could be repaired in an hour or two, but it turned out to be the next day. After the repair, the whole house was dirty and smelly. I called and asked if I could change the bedding tomorrow. Tell me to go downstairs and then go upstairs to take a bath in the recreation center on another building. The implication is that we won’t change. I’ll tell you where you want to wash it or not. I asked if so many people could be accommodated if they all poured in from the guest rooms. I was struggling with my baby at 90 o'clock in the evening. After thinking about it, I had to use the hot water kettle to boil some water and just scrub. Fortunately, I brought a basin. , but it can’t be cleaned cleanly and it’s very cold. I’m so speechless.

② When I first entered the room, it smelled bad and the air conditioner was not cooling (I called the guest room and they said that the hotel managed the air conditioner temperature uniformly. I don’t understand. Is the temperature the same in every room?)
③ The water in the bathtub was yellow (the hotel provided a free disposable bathtub cover). There were only two bottles of free drinks in the room. You should not take more drinking water because they sell 1L mineral water.
④ The refrigerator was broken.
⑤ The gym is an independent charging facility and is not under the management of the hotel. It is open to the public. Guests staying in the room still need to pay extra to exercise.

It was extremely hot when I first entered the room, there was a strange smell, and the air conditioner could not cool? When I changed rooms, I found that seven or eight rooms on other floors were also ridiculously hot. The control panel on the wall showed "30 degrees", "33 degrees", and "32 degrees"! ! ! When I asked, the air conditioner could not cool after August. The five-star hotel did not solve this problem in two months? ? ? I could only choose a room with 29 degrees to stay. I had Yongchang's 109 buffet for dinner. The dishes were simple and the dishes were replenished slowly. The breakfast was simple and boring. In short, the experience of staying was very bad

msg:Absolutely frightening experience, the first time I was fooled by the hotel.
Six of us rushed from Datong to Youyu on the evening of August 17th to check in. We chose the best local hotel, thinking that we could relax leisurely the next day. At around seven in the morning, I seemed to hear someone broadcasting in the room in my dream, "There is an emergency, you need to evacuate immediately..." The first time, we were dizzy and didn't care. After more than ten minutes, we received a loud broadcast in the room again, "There is an emergency, you need to evacuate immediately..." I immediately thought it was an earthquake, I was dizzy, woke up my family, frantically looked for clothes, and prepared to go downstairs for shelter. A friend called and said that after checking with the front desk, it was the maintenance staff who made a surprise inspection and debugged the equipment. I was still in shock. Are we being fooled? Even if there was no time to notify the guests when checking in, they couldn't say a few more words during the broadcast, "Debugging the equipment??? What level, this is more casual than a small hotel. The standard for breakfast in a four-star hotel is only five slices of bread. It's really calculating. The soy milk is gone, just pour water directly. This management level is too low. Bad review Bad review

There are electric curtains, separate wet and dry toilets, and the location is suitable and the environment is quiet. Since it is not a tourist hotspot, the price is not high, more than 300 yuan is acceptable. The breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western food, and the variety is quite rich. Good review!

msg:Such a tall hotel did not provide air conditioning after the summer solstice. It was like staying in a steamer at night. I went to the front desk to find a solution at 12 in the middle of the night. I could only adjust the room. The other rooms were just as stuffy. Finally, the floor attendant helped to find a small electric fan, and it was considered to have survived the night. Who would dare to stay in a hotel where air-conditioning can only be provided in July without thinking about the guests and not caring about the guests' feelings?

msg:When I saw the comment that the hotel turned off the air conditioning at night, I was suspicious. I was very afraid of the heat~~ So before I went, I called the front desk again and again to ask: "Is the air-conditioning open 24 hours? Will the air-conditioning be turned off at night?", the answer is yes . As a result, it’s not the same thing after I went there. It’s the same as the previous netizens have reported. Generally, at 12 o’clock in the evening, the air-conditioning switchboard of the entire hotel is turned off. The indoor temperature is 26 or 27 degrees. I feel that the room is very hot. It is uncomfortable~~~~ Until 6/7 in the morning, the air conditioner is turned on again~~~ The response to the front desk is also invalid. At night, the air conditioner switchboard is still turned off~~~~ Is this a five-star hotel? Seriously unworthy.
