msg:My stay at the Hyakumangoku Onsen Hotel was a unique blend of modern Japanese style and traditional onsen experience. The hotel's architecture and interior design were sleek and contemporary, creating a serene and peaceful atmosphere.

However, I was disappointed to find that the hot spring was not available for couple usage, which was a major draw for me. Despite being renovated in 2021, some fixtures and soft furnishings showed signs of wear and tear, which detracted from the overall experience.

On the plus side, the hotel's location was convenient for visiting Shanghai Disney Land and Shanghai Village, which offered a range of international brands for shopping.

Overall, I would recommend the Hyakumangoku Onsen Hotel for its modern take on traditional Japanese hospitality, but with the caveat that some areas may need further attention to detail.

And the service in general was great, but it was difficult at times because the clerkes didn’t speak English. But they were very understanding and tried to speak to us through WeChat..

Check-in was easy with a lot of freebies, such as game coins for the arcade machine, free breakfast ($198RMB), 2 adults to the onsen and a 2 person dinner set which we shared between 3 adults and 1 child.

From higher points in the hotel you can view the fireworks that Disney shows every night.
Daily shuttle bus to Disney is easy but needs to be pre-booked, easy to do at the check-in counter. Return shuttle is also available and should be booked at the same time.

The onsen was nice, in the mens bath there were 4 pools, 2 indoors and 2 outdoors. Additional service is backscrubbing which was reasonably priced for the type of accom.

Room was nice and clean with 2 single beds that can be pushed together to form a king sized bed. 
Onsen yukatas were provided in the room after check-in.

The cost performance ratio was obviously much lower. I take back my recommendation. The dessert was cancelled when I checked in, and the dessert in the evening was also cancelled. I also found that the sound insulation was too poor. I could hear the snoring next door clearly at night. At 5 o'clock in the morning, I don't know why they got up so early and chatted outside, which made me unable to sleep. At 7 o'clock in the morning, the neighbors sang loudly, and I was really impressed.

If you have a trip to Disney or Bicester in your itinerary, the cost-effectiveness is still quite high (after all, Disney is now priced at 4K, and this hotel is 1K8 for a stay, convenient and in a good location. It is also a high-end one under the Gokuraku Hot Springs 🏨)

It is less than 2KM away from Disney. The hotel has a shuttle bus to Disney in the morning, and the last bus is at 9:30. It is also very close to Bicester and convenient for shopping.

If you arrive at the hotel earlier, you can have afternoon tea and go to the hot springs in the evening. You can also catch dolls and take photos in the hotel 👘. These activities are also suitable for bringing children to play.
If you are only going for the hot springs ♨️, it is definitely not worth it, because it is not a private hot spring. The breakfast is average, a little disappointed, I didn’t see Udon noodles

The hot spring is in the middle of several buildings. It is very convenient, quiet and clean. The aunt is very diligent in cleaning. You can get a bottle of drink from the vending machine with a hand card. You can see a little bit of Disney fireworks in the innermost hot spring pool.
The hotel breakfast is a typical Japanese breakfast and some Chinese breakfast. The taste and quantity vary from person to person. I am more acceptable.

But the bed was so hard that I couldn't sleep on it. It was so hard that I couldn't even get up! Have you changed the mattress?
There is actually a charge for the minibar in the house. This is a bit petty.

Has the breakfast been improved? How can it be so simple? Only the udon noodles are hot! It's not completely freshly cooked, just hot soup poured over the udon noodles.
The bread is also of convenience store quality

The hot spring is okay. I hope the store can improve the breakfast quality.

The service staff greets you with a dedicated attitude and smile, creating a warm and comfortable home feeling for guests.

A paradise for physical and mental relaxation

The hotel not only provides comfortable rooms and excellent services, but also physical and mental relaxation brought by hot spring bathing. Immersed in the warm spring water, the body seems to be liberated, and worries and pressure gradually dissipate in the water, bringing unparalleled comfort and pleasure.

Meticulous and thoughtful care

The service staff greets guests with a smile, and their professionalism and professional attitude win the praise of guests. Clean the room every day to create a clean and comfortable living environment, so that guests can feel meticulous and thoughtful care and warmth.

Harmony with nature

The hotel park is full of greenery, with birds singing and flowers blooming. It is far away from the hustle and bustle, and the harmonious scene of symbiosis with nature is intoxicating. There is no hustle and bustle of high-rise buildings, no sense of oppression in the city, only tranquility and relaxation, which makes this holiday paradise

Our family of three did not receive any milk. The only thing I want to praise is that the driver who picked up and dropped off Disneyland was very punctual, and the weirdest thing is the hygiene. The corridor light at the door of the room is voice-activated. It will automatically light up when I get up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet... Wouldn't it be easy to wake up my sleeping family members? The person who checked in at the front desk also lacked service awareness. I even came in with my luggage and looked at the front desk. I didn’t go to the computer to check it out for me immediately... What I want to complain about the most is the breakfast. Although it is a buffet, except for the porridge, everything else is too unpalatable, especially the omelette is super hard, as mentioned in other guest reviews Udon noodles are not provided at all. This is really the worst breakfast I have ever had in a hotel where I have stayed so many times.

msg:The breakfast is very good, there are not many Japanese varieties but they are exquisite and delicious! The service was just average. There was a foreman at the front desk who was a bit rude and lived far away. Although he helped to pull the boxes, it was a bit deducted. There were also stains on the tatami. The public bathing pool is very clean and comfortable with few people. The toiletries are more thoughtful, but the children's supplies are not prepared and not meticulous enough!

There are not many people bathing in the hot spring. It is clean and tidy, and you can relax your body and mind~
I especially like the view at night. In addition, you can see Disney's castle in the distance from the room🎆

msg:I originally wanted to be close to Disney, but something very disgusting happened when I checked out: the front desk asked me how my check-in experience was, and I casually said it was okay, but the air conditioner was still a bit noisy at night, right? Something is wrong, there is a dripping sound like dripping water at night. I didn't think about anything, just checked out and left. The front desk said they were sorry and gave me a box of small gifts. I felt embarrassed at first, but when I got home and opened it, I saw that I was given a box of expired cookies with Merry Christmas written on it, and it was expired! What does this mean? First of all, I checked out on March 7th, which is also Women’s Day. What is the purpose of sending someone away with expired inventory? I will never come back to this hotel again. The service is very, very inadequate and unprofessional. Bad review! What does it mean to give customers cookies that have expired for so long? Be a human being?

What needs improvement is that the room is on the second floor but there is no elevator. There are no toilet paper, makeup sponges or cotton swabs in the bathroom. The charges of a 5-star hotel are not up to this standard. Yukata cannot be selected. If you want to choose a color, you can only pay an additional rental fee of 398+. The hot spring area is very small, with only one natural hot spring. There are no video rooms or lounges in the public areas. There are no bath towels for bathing, only face-sized towels are provided. The restaurant has a good a**osphere, but the taste is average.

Although Ji Le Tang is small, it is better because there are fewer people and it is clean.
Breakfast has a little less variety, service is pretty good
The venue is well maintained. I don’t want to go out of Shanghai on weekends.
Take a vacation with great value for money~

After a crazy day at Disney, have a good sleep in the hot spring hotel, have a delicious breakfast the next morning, and then stroll around the hotel and soak in the hot springs. It’s not too much. At ease. Children also like this hotel very much. When checking in, the front desk will give you five coins to catch dolls in the claw machine next to it. There is also a large lawn next to the hot spring pavilion. The swing is the children's favorite. When the weather is nice, It’s so fun to play on the swing🥳, and the hotel will prepare gifts for guests staying in the hotel during every festival, haha, it’s a very warm hotel. Special mention to the restaurant manager, he is a very nice person. I have two children, one of whom is older. When we were having breakfast, we thought of adding another breakfast, but the manager said we don’t have to pay anymore. It’s the New Year and we will give you one as a gift. Thank you! Next time I come to Disneyland, I will choose Million Stone Hot Spring Hotel again.

msg:My home is located in Pudong, Shanghai, and it's only a few subway stops and two or three shuttle stops away from Wanwanshi. I bought a discounted family package for this hot spring hotel on Ctrip, which includes: one night's stay, Japanese buffet breakfast, hot spring + two free drinks after soaking, and 15 game coins. Let’s talk about my and my family’s experiences in detail one by one:
1. Stay for one night. When checking in, the handsome guy at the front desk was very considerate and arranged a room on the second floor of 5B. Note: This is the best place to watch the Disney fireworks at night! We took a lot of videos and it was so worth it! After opening the door with the room card, the floor heating and air conditioning in the house will automatically turn on and turn off automatically after ten o'clock at night. There is no need to worry about the severe cold outside. Personally, I am too hot. Although I push a small window to 35 degrees all night (push It reached the limit), but it was still too hot that night and I didn’t sleep well (the only thing I didn’t like about this experience). The indoor bedding is very clean, and the light from the lamps is soft. What is particularly considerate is that the ceiling lights in the entrance and dry and wet areas are sensor-controlled. They will light up when someone walks by, and will turn off automatically after leaving for a while. Well, I like the toilet the most. It is warm and comfortable anytime I sit on it, and there is no problem in using the female, butt cleansing and drying functions. I also like the configuration of the sink and bathroom: transplanted soft-bristle toothbrush + Oral-B toothpaste, Australian niche brand appelles black label toiletries, all of which demonstrate quality and care in details.
2. Japanese buffet breakfast. It’s not purely Japanese, there are sushi, fish, porridge, small wontons, grilled bacon, butter bread, etc. The milk at room temperature is of good quality, the juice is very clear, and the pineapple, cucumber, watermelon, and cantaloupe cut into pieces are also very fresh. From 7:00 to 10:00 in the morning, when all kinds of food are almost exhausted, they will be added in time. The overall quality of breakfast is good.
3. Hot spring + two free drinks after soaking. The hot spring is open from 10:00 to 23:00, separate for men and women, and the whole fruit bath is available. Just bring your room card with you when you go. It is recommended to bring a shower cap. My family only soaked in the women's bath, which is two pools of different depths. The water temperature was very comfortable and we soaked for nearly 20 minutes. After soaking, I sat for a while in the Japanese-style lobby and drank room-temperature Sprite, which was very relaxing. We didn't pay for the massage, although there was a coupon, but preferred the Thai massage with clothes on.
4. 15 game coins. The claw machine puts 5 coins in each time. I played it three times and didn’t get any dolls. I was very happy.
5. Regarding dinner on the day of check-in and lunch on the next day. I ate at Yi Oulai across the road from the hotel. I had Wang Fei’s Barbecue and Yeli Xali respectively. It was very convenient to buy the set meal online on Dianping.com.

There is no rest area to lie down. After soaking, you can only go back to the room. I booked it for 6 days and 5 nights. Upgrade me to a room with at least a bathtub. It rained every day for 6 days and 5 nights and I have never experienced such a boring and boring vacation. The only hotel facilities are hot springs where I can go for a while and then there is nothing. Fortunately, there is a shopping village opposite and there are restaurants. There are many branded products available, and they are all discounted, which is so cheap! Will come to the shopping village again next time!

The advantage is that it is very unique and great for taking photos. The disadvantage is that it is quite cold in winter when you go to the hot spring bathing place from where you live. The hotel has floor heating, which makes it very warm in winter. The hot spring pool is divided into indoor and outdoor areas, and the outdoor one is very Japanese style.

msg:I almost never write negative reviews. This time I must give a negative review to the hotel’s hot springs:
1. The woman who assisted in bathing on the morning of 1/13 was extremely fierce. After being tired from Disneyland the day before, I chose to take a shower while sitting down. I was afraid that the chair would be dirty and I had to use a towel pad. The female bathing assistant screamed and refused to let me bathe while giving guests a bath. Sitting, it is said to be disinfected in the morning and evening, but disinfecting in the morning and evening does not mean that every guest is disinfected immediately after sitting down. Sitting with bare buttocks is always unhygienic, right? She didn't give me a disposable bath pad or money when I asked her. Finally, she gave me two shower caps. I was really convinced and talked a lot. I was in a good mood early in the morning and was scolded for no reason. pause.
2. There are no bath towels in the entire hot spring, and the towels are not divided into upper and lower bodies. There are only one-size face towels for guests to wipe. When I went to soak outdoors, there was no towel to block the wind.
3. Both indoor and outdoor hot spring areas and changing areas require bare feet, and there is no pair of non-slip slippers. The floor feels cold when you step on it, and some places are also very slippery.
The rooms are also very ordinary. There is no elevator in the second floor room and you have to carry your own suitcases. There is no bathtub in the rooms priced at 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. There are few choices for breakfast. I strongly recommend not to take advantage of this price and standard.

It would be better to add a salad. Of course, as a hot spring hotel, Tangquan's is still great. The decoration is very Japanese, and the hot spring is very comfortable. It's great to soak in the outdoor hot spring and watch the stars. The spa in Tangquan is also very good, and the service staff are very enthusiastic. Chat with the staff, and the Japanese curator will often come to evaluate the water quality and service quality! All in all, it’s great to take a dip in the hot springs and massage your feet after visiting Disneyland! I will choose this place next time I come to Disney.

However, the sales service provided by the staff in the hot spring can be reduced or introduced at the front desk.
Good environment, good facilities, and a small garden for children to run around
Instructions for floor heating, air conditioning, etc. can be added in Chinese and English for the convenience of passengers.
Although there is an explanation at the front desk, you may not remember it when you return to your room.
Hot springs, restaurants, etc. are all good
Overall good

msg:I watched a lot of video introductions before traveling and was quite looking forward to the hotel, but the overall experience was not good. Let’s talk about the good parts first. The environment is relatively quiet, check-in is very fast and smooth, Bicester is across the road and is very convenient for eating, and the overall attitude of the staff is very good. Then I talked about my dissatisfaction: I initially stayed in Building 2 and the room had a peculiar smell, so I moved to another room. After unpacking everything, I went out for lunch. When I came back, I found that there was still a strong smell in the room. This smell was caused by smelly socks blowing in the heater. I finally found out that it was the central air conditioner. Then we packed our luggage and changed rooms. A responsible person from the hotel came and offered to upgrade our room to Building 6. However, the so-called upgrade was to change to a room with a private bath on the balcony, and the room area was reduced. This private hot spring is a bit cumbersome. On the day of check-in, the outdoor temperature was less than 5 degrees, and the private hot spring can be seen from every angle on the balcony.

There is a place where you can rent kimonos, have afternoon tea and make handicrafts. Children like gashapon machines and claw machines very much. The location is very good. It is very convenient to go to Disney. There is a bus stop just a few steps away, three stops to Disney, and Bicester Shopping Center is across the road. After a day at Disneyland, I went to take a bath when I was tired, and then made an appoin**ent for a massage to relieve fatigue. Suddenly I remembered that there was an ice cream making machine, a tutorial on hand-folding paper, and there was a swing outside and a bunny on the lawn. All in all, it’s super suitable for kids to come and play. It’s my first time to write a review on Ctrip. I’m usually lazy, but bringing Disney tickets for two nights this time was a great experience, so I’ll give it to everyone.

The first time I ordered takeout in the park, I found that I couldn't get it in because I couldn't drive a moped. All takeaways had to be ordered in by myself. Some riders require me to bear the taxi fare, otherwise I will cancel. Things in the hotel are relatively expensive. The hot spring pavilion is so small and ends at 23:00. There are only two hot spring pools indoors and two outdoors. A sauna. There is nothing to play with and the children find it boring. However, it is relatively convenient to go to Disneyland, parks, and surrounding areas. There are buses available at the door.

It was the flower blooming season, and when I opened the window in the morning, I saw a garden full of flowers. It was so beautiful!
As a hot spring hotel, the pool is clean and sanitary. After all, there are so few people that it can almost be reserved. I would like to praise the auntie who took a bath 👍. I have never dared to try it. This time I will give it a try. Auntie's technique is very professional. Because I am shy and afraid of pain, she will change the intensity according to my needs so that I can enjoy it with peace of mind. Especially after soaking and boiling, it is very comfortable~
Finally, I may have gone to breakfast late. I felt that the content was not as rich as before, and there were too many small flying insects in the fruit area (because it was very sweet). Overall it's great!

msg:In a word, this hotel rests on its laurels. If I was going to pay the same amount, I would have preferred to stay at a hotel in Shanghai and use the taxi fare.
The hotel is set up in a Japanese style, but it seems that it was not supervised by Japanese people. If you are planning to go shopping at Shanghai Disneyland or the outlets, the location is good.
The large public bath attached to the hotel is clean, but there are only a few large bathtubs with no particular features, an open-air bath, and a sauna. The bath also offers a body scrub service, but the staff are annoying when they try to sell you. Even if you refuse in Chinese, they keep trying. What's more, the price is about three times the market price, which is surprising.
The bath temperature was displayed as around 40 degrees, but it felt lukewarm to me.
If you are going there for the hot spring, you will be disappointed.
I was even more dissatisfied with the breakfast. I heard that the main dishes were Japanese-style, but there were only a few types and the quality was low. To be honest, it was bad... Chinese people who don't know anything about it might mistake it for Japanese food. As a Japanese person, I would like them to improve this as it damages my image.
I was surprised that the rice and grilled fish were cold. The sushi rolls were sticky and all the rice was mixed together. The miso soup and udon broth were worse than retort-style.
It was also difficult to move around the hotel. I booked a regular room, not a cottage or villa, but I was given a room where I had to go outside to get to the front desk, bath, or dining area. It was raining when I checked in, so it was the worst.
The room was clean. Two bottles of room temperature water were provided for free, but I was surprised that the same bottled water in the fridge had to be charged for.

Since it's summer, there aren't many people in the hot springs. You can go to the nearby Lavender Park by swiping your hotel room card. There is no bathtub in the room. Ask the front desk for a bathtub to bathe the baby. He is too young to go to the hot springs. The service is also very friendly, and there are battery carts that can be delivered to the room.

I chose this place mainly to go to Shanghai Disney. The hotel has a shuttle bus. It doesn’t matter if the hotel shuttle fails to catch up. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel. The resort has direct access to the Disney bus parking lot. It can only be reached by shuttle bus. The Donald Duck parking lot is closer to the park on foot; opposite is Bicester Shopping Village. If you stay a day in advance, you can go shopping and the restaurants are also good;
The hot spring bathing experience is very good. Japanese-style bathing is conducted separately for men and women, and management is strict. There are 4 hot spring pools for women (2 indoors, 2 outdoor). The hot springs are not real hot springs, but soft water made with professional equipment, which helps It softens and cares for the skin. The water temperature is constant at 40 degrees. After soaking for half an hour, I am already sweating all over the body. It is very comfortable.
The breakfast is a buffet, which is quite rich. The curry rice and miso soup are delicious. The overall food is very Japanese, and natto is also provided (although I don't like it personally).
I stayed there for two days and there was nothing I was dissatisfied with. The price/performance ratio was high and it was worth staying.

At first, I wanted to book a hotel next door, Meliá, but the date I wanted to stay was gone; I also saw Ctrip’s 919 promotion, where two nights and two breakfasts only cost 1,948 yuan, which is a great deal! Just give it a try.
The actual experience is very good. The decoration style is restrained and luxurious, with great texture and class!
When we first arrived at the hotel, the car parked in front of the door, but there was no bellman!
If you want to go to Disneyland, the station across the road from the hotel entrance is the direction to the Disney subway station! The front desk didn't explain it clearly at the time. It would be better if it could be explained in more detail! If you want to go to Disney Town, it’s right in front of the hotel and to the western suburbs hub. It only costs 1 yuan to take the bus. A bus comes every two or three minutes, and there is no one on the bus. The speed is faster than the hotel shuttle bus, but the shuttle bus also takes a detour...
After playing Disney well, when I came back in the evening, a handsome guy at the front desk helped me with my luggage and brought it to the room. Other project activity locations were also introduced.
There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the quality is definitely good and delicious!
The hotel's bliss bath is exactly like the bathhouse in Japanese dramas. The aunt has a very good attitude and takes the initiative to hand out towels and help tie hair.
After checking out and returning home, I found that the new hairband I bought for my children was gone. I called the hotel and found it. I’m so happy to have lost it and found it again!
If I have the chance, I would like to come again next time! !
However, the game coins and souvenirs in the package this time are missing. I hope I can replenish them next time, hehe😁

Facilities: Very complete configuration, baby pillows, baby auxiliary stools, baby slippers, baby toothbrushes are all provided.

Hygiene: The guest rooms are very clean, so feel free to step on the floor with bare feet!

Environment: Quiet and undisturbed, pure Japanese experience!

Service: This is the key point. When the service staff see us, they will greet us very friendly and proactively, which makes us feel cordial. I would especially like to praise the young man named Jerry at the front desk. After we checked in, he unexpectedly followed us out to help us pick up our luggage. We were very touched! He did a great job in this aspect, which made Wanshi Hotel even more popular in our hearts! This is one of the important reasons why I want to write another review!
We will still visit again!

msg:Because I want to take my baby to Disneyland, I plan to live nearby. I chose a million stones. Although I found that there are good and bad when referring to the reviews, I would like to share my specific feelings for your reference.

Location: Very close to Disney, there is a direct bus at the door. It is also convenient to take a taxi. But Disney may encounter traffic control when it comes out at night, so the bus is still very convenient. The hotel itself also has a bus to Disney, which is scheduled. We didn't take it because the time didn't match.

It was noon when we arrived at the hotel. We checked in very enthusiastically in the lobby, explained the matters, and then took us to our residence by battery car. We live in a room on the second floor. The room is clean. The tatami setting makes the children very happy. The basic equipment is still very good. It has everything we need. We want a double bed room, double bed room and twin bed room this time. The settings are different, and mothers can compare according to their own needs. I said I chose a small table, and children can play in this area.

Snacks are given when you check in. The toothbrush and toothpaste for children, including the toothpaste for adults, are all made in Japan. This equipment is not bad. The toiletries are generously replenished, there is mung bean sweet soup every night, and the cleaning is also timely.

There is greenery outside the room window, and the environment of the whole hotel is very good. My children and I both like it, it's quiet and suitable for walking. My child and I also swiped the card to go to the lavender garden at the back, which is very big and empty. Although there is no lavender in this season, it also makes people feel refreshed. Saw a lot of roses. It is said that there is a rabbit nest next to it, for children to play, Shanghainese and those who have enough time can arrange it.

On the first night when we arrived at the store, we went to the opposite Bicester for dinner. It was just across the road, and the environment was also very good. Then we bought Arabica coffee. The coffee star who moved from Wuzhen finally drank coffee, so happy. That is to say, there is no need to worry about eating. You can also use Japanese food in the hotel if you like.

The hotel has a place where you can rent kimonos. You can go there if you like. There is also a small room where you can catch dolls. Give 10 coins. Children can catch babies twice. We reserved five coins for playing.

On the first night, we tried bathing. At first, we were a little apprehensive because we were worried that there would be too many people in the naked bath, but after we went, we found that there were not many people, so we took a dip with peace of mind. The body and mind were happy, and the children were also very happy. Bathing process: After going there, I will store my shoes, put away my things, rinse, soak in the bath, and then I can wash there. The shampoo and bath supplies are all from Japan, and the hair dryer is Dyson. The whole configuration is still very good of.

I went to Disney early the next morning and booked a Didi car, which was very convenient. Came back after a long day of fighting and ordered takeout. The takeaway will be delivered to the hotel lobby, just pick it up.

In the morning of the third day, we had a serious breakfast, after all, we didn't eat it the first day. Our family likes Japanese food very much, which is why I chose this restaurant without any scruples. The breakfast is more Japanese. I have tried a lot, such as homemade miso soup, homemade curry rice, and smoked food. Salmon, all kinds of grilled food, is a new experience.

After breakfast, we played for a long time on the big lawn where there are mushrooms, swings, trampolines and slides, as shown in the picture, the environment is really good.

Then I went to soak the soup for the second time, which was a very happy process. We can receive a bottle of milk with our wristband every time we finish the bath, and we can also choose Coke or Sprite.

When we left, we had to go back to downtown Shanghai. We chose the bus to take the subway to Disney Station, which was very convenient.

Finally, let’s talk about the room, which is equipped with a dehumidifier, and the quilt will be a little damp. For me, I think the quilt is a little thick, haha. Other room facilities are still good. TV didn't watch. You can sit on tatami at any time, very comfortable.

I bought it at a good price when I was engaged in an event. If it is not too expensive on weekdays, you can experience it. Personally, I think it is good, and the service attitude is also very good. Reference for everyone with babies.

Although check-in was not ready until after 2 o'clock, we were upgraded to a room with a private bath. There were electric cars to pick up and drop off in and out, and the service was excellent! As long as you stay at the hotel, you have unlimited entry and exit, free drinks every time, and there are very few people and it is very clean. There are also swings, slides and trampolines that children love, and they won’t want to leave.

msg:It’s already a second-budget hotel. The last time I was with my family at the beginning of last year. This time I brought friends. I chose the hotel’s package, which was very cost-effective. Apart from the welcome gift and the soup, it included breakfast and a full meal. It was more cost-effective than booking a single meal. We arrived early that day and checked in smoothly. Because the room was not cleaned, we reserved a phone call and left our luggage. Arrived, the front desk was a bit busy, but fortunately my room had been reserved, so I took the luggage and welcome gift, and followed the bellman to the downstairs where we lived. Coincidentally, it was next to the room I lived in last time. With the capsule coffee provided in the room and the wagashi as a gift, it was a delicious afternoon tea. After drinking good coffee, I took my friends for a walk around the hotel. I went to the lavender park next to the wall after going through the gate control. After dinner, I went to the hot spring. I hung the doll with the 5 free game coins. The added ✌️ breakfast is mainly Japanese style. The venue is not big but the variety is quite rich. My friend loves the curry sauce and regrets discovering it too late, otherwise a curry rice can knock her down 😄 During breakfast, the welcome staff confirmed the lunch time with us. Every service staff member greeted them warmly and proactively, especially the room attendants. They gave them a little trouble when they checked out, but they still gave them a warm and polite farewell. I am so sorry. For me, this is a resort hotel worth staying in. I hope the hotel will get better and better. Looking forward to seeing you next time 🌹

You can take the bus directly to the Disneyland subway station at any time within a 100-meter walk. There won’t be many people riding in the car after watching the fireworks show at night. What is worthy of praise is that the management of the hot spring attached to the hotel is very good. My mother and her 5-year-old boy thought that they would not be able to bathe in the hot spring. She asked with the intention of giving it a try. The waiter said that she could take the child to bathe or play with the child for a while. . It liberated the mother, the hot spring was so comfortable, and the child slept soundly at night. In addition, the restaurant environment is very good. If you are not in a hurry, it would be very comfortable to have afternoon tea here.

msg:The two-night room purchased in the 1988 group can be used from Sunday to Thursday without any increase in price. Compared to the calendar price, it is quite cost-effective. You can stay together or separately, and you can go to the hotel's hot spring pool during your stay every time.
The overall facilities of the hotel are relatively new, and the internal faucet and toilet configurations are also relatively good. Another advantage is that you can swipe the key card to enter the lavender garden directly, which is a blessing during the lavender season.
To the northwest of the hotel is Disneyland. You can also swipe your card to enter the lavender garden at night and watch the fireworks on the lawn. However, the low-altitude areas are blocked by trees, and you can only see the high-altitude part.
Talking about the bad, there is a weak light from the charging port in the hotel room. The curtains cannot completely block the light that shines into the room in the morning. The quilt is very thick. In summer, the air conditioner is turned on to 22 degrees, but it is still too hot even if it is covered.
The breakfast has Japanese characteristics, with limited varieties. The restaurant is not big and there are relatively few seats.

The garden environment in the hotel makes you relaxed and happy. When you want to shop, the Bicsite Shopping Village opposite the hotel is great. You had a great time shopping... So I posted it to Moments after checking out yesterday, and several friends immediately purchased packages on Ctrip. In the evening, I went to Ctrip to book another package, but I didn’t expect the price to go up. This is too unfriendly. Maybe the price has gone up as more people place orders...
    Special mention is that its Japanese-style breakfast is great

msg:Finally, the weather is not so hot anymore, so I can go out and play. It’s quite comfortable to soak in the hot springs today.
The room we were given was in Building 5B. After checking in, a battery car would drive you there. However, the distance was not bad and it was very convenient to walk around. The environment was very elegant and quiet along the way.
The room is very Japanese, very large, and the layout is very simple. There are two mattresses on a tatami mat as the bed. There is a sofa and a small table by the window. They are all in the style of logs. The solid wood floors have no carpets and are very clean. This design should be used in winter. There is floor heating.
There really isn't much to say about the room. The main feature is the hot spring. I stayed there for two nights and soaked three times. I met two or three people in total, and they didn't all arrive at the same time, so each time I soaked in the pool, it was reserved. There are three indoor pools and two outdoor ones. The weather is still hot in this season, so it will be much more comfortable to soak in the outdoor ones. Every time you soak in a hot spring, you can get a free bottle of milk with your hand card when you come out of the hot spring. After you come out, there is a row of mirrors where you can sit and do your skin care and hair drying. The skin care products are all from Japan and the hair dryer is from Dyson. What I like most is that the dressing area is not hot (nor cold) at all. You can soak in the hot springs when it is very hot. It’s no longer uncomfortable to blow dry your hair here.

The breakfast on the second day was a bit ordinary, with few varieties. What was unique was that there were many Japanese foods, such as natto sushi and salmon. I have never eaten these things in the morning.

I can definitely come again for this hot spring, but it would be nice if the price was more cost-effective. The price/performance ratio is really not high.

Their Japanese kaiseki cuisine is really high-end and many celebrities have the same style. The quality of each service staff in this hotel is very high. The most impressive thing about this hotel is our butler Hu Xiaobu (his WeChat name). He always smiles and salutes us and takes care of us patiently. I accompanied the child with the doll and always asked us what we needed. Just tell me, I think Xiao Hu really made me feel like a VIP. The experience of this hotel is very good and comfortable, and the grade is very high. I remember Xiao Hu said that we want every guest to experience the noble experience of the Million Stone Hotel, with service first. So I have a very good impression of Million Stone. I have already introduced several friends to come to Million Stone. The preferred brand hotel for visiting Disney is Million Stone. I’m sending this praise from the bottom of my heart. On the day we left the store, Xiao Hu specially walked us to Bicester opposite. There are many shopping brands in Bicester. Next time I’ll stay at Million Stone Hotel. It’s really comfortable. It’s a one-stop shop for shopping. My sister is also very warm. She gave me two face masks every day, which are very useful. The sanitation is very clean, and the clothes are neatly folded for us. In short, the Million Stone Hotel is really worthy of your precious possession! Remember to ask the butler Hu Xiaobu!

msg:A so-called high-end resort hotel. When I arrived, I had a lot of luggage because I was traveling with my family. The price was nearly 9,000 for two nights. There was a railing in the parking lot at the front of the hotel.
After checking in at the front desk, I still had to ask for a shuttle bus to take us to the room. The courtyard was messy and dirty. Continuing the characteristics of Japanese tatami, guests are allowed to change shoes at the door, but there is no provision for courtyard shoes in the courtyard room. So should I go to the courtyard barefoot or should I go to the courtyard with my shoes and change out of slippers.
After staying for two nights, I had to call the front desk several times to have toiletries delivered to the room. Toothbrush and bath towel are not enough. A resort hotel has only one shuttle bus, and the distance to the lobby is far away. You need a shuttle bus to travel, but you can't wait for the shuttle bus. Waiting for more than 20 minutes is common.
Every concierge I saw from the moment I checked in was always black-faced. The people at the front desk were in a mess, and some were dining at the front desk. It is indeed the first time I have seen it in a hotel of this level.
You can hear the sneezing of the residents next to the courtyard room. There is no distance between the courtyard and a fence and bamboo hat wall separate the two rooms.
Because the child is going to Disney, there is a shuttle bus to the hotel, but the front desk suggested that I take the bus by myself and said that I would have to walk for more than ten minutes after they delivered it. When I arrived by the bus, I found that I was still there It takes more than ten minutes to walk. A shuttle bus, probably because there are not many tourists going to this point, they are unwilling to let a few of us go. I was very angry after buying it for 9,000 taels a night.
Lightning protection! ! ! Why not choose the Disneyland Hotel! ! !
The meal is because I checked in at noon, and the children were hungry. I went to the restaurant and ordered a set meal. I ordered two servings of wagyu fried rice for 188. The meat was old and unpalatable. I don’t know what kind of cognition your store has for wagyu. of such quality. Dining for four people cost 700+ and I felt so sick after eating it.

The men's conditioner and shower gel are made in the island. They are so good that I have repurchased them. The service at the front desk and in the restaurant is indeed unsatisfactory, and there is indeed a clear gap in service awareness. I didn’t ask about the shuttle bus, and I didn’t take the initiative to tell you. I didn’t know if I didn’t read everyone’s reviews. It was more convenient to take the bus at the door. If you stay two nights in a row, you will be given game currency for one day. Although it is worthless, these are also the right to housing. I ate something unknown for breakfast and put it in my teeth. I have no sense of apology. I just explain that this is not a dirty thing. I don’t want to affect my mood. . It's a good hotel, don't let the service hold you back.

msg:I went to Shanghai Disneyland and found a treasure hotel. It's about half an hour's walk from Disney, which should be about 1.6 kilometers. There is a special line bus for the resort at the entrance, and the toll for one yuan goes directly to Disney Town. The hotel also has a shuttle bus, which is easy to book. The hotel is very quiet and the environment is very good. The interior decoration is very Japanese and very comfortable. The service of the hotel is very good, checking in, eating, soaking in hot springs, room service, and finally checking out, all respond super fast. All service staff are friendly and enthusiastic. This is the feeling of being at home~ The hotel's food and beverages are also very good, breakfast, afternoon tea, I have tried the dinner, the quality is good and the taste is amazing~ I really chose the right hotel when I came to Disneyland, I am very satisfied with the accommodation experience, I will definitely come again if I have the opportunity~

msg:I have to write a review. I am really sorry for the price. I booked a standard room. The room has two beds similar to tatami mats. It looks very simple because I brought some snacks myself. As soon as I entered The room is simple, there is nowhere to put things, and there is a sofa bed next to it? It is divided into two parts, so it can be regarded as a styling sofa. There is a small coffee table to put things on. It can only hold a mobile phone and a bottle of mineral water. There are also bedside tables on both sides, which are very small. Then I called the front desk to ask about this situation, and they helped bring a simple folding small table. The standard room is said to be like this, and the pictures on the Internet also show it like this. Is this the case for such an expensive room? Then there is Ctrip, which says it will give away five game coins and a bottle of milk. Is it good to have it on its own? It's a bit deceptive to consumers. The bathing area feels too basic and not worth the price. Please avoid lightning.

msg:The artistic conception of the hotel is well done, with every plant and tree and various arrangements, as if you are really in Japan. The room is quite big, there is music playing, and the bathroom has a washlet. The service is very good, the concierge can respond to various needs in a timely manner, and also added mineral water in time, and delivered mung bean soup at night (but why is there only one spoon with a small mouthful in it?)

Several scenes of the hotel are very suitable for taking pictures in yukata. The colors provided by the hotel are average, and a serious kimono rental shop opposite the lobby is more expensive. I brought a set of my own yukata and added some accessories, which can be done in a few hundred. The hotel does not provide slippers, only disposable cotton slippers, it is best to bring a pair of plastic ones.

The breakfast is so-so, and the rich variety may not be as good as Atour. But there are curry rice and smoked salmon, which are very special and taste ok, and the food is quite satisfactory.

Lunch is also eaten in the hotel restaurant. The tableware is quite elegant and the taste level is medium. It is convenient. After all, 200 meters away is the restaurant area of ​​Bicester, so it is not necessary to eat here.

The soup restaurant is a bit disappointing. The public area is about 0, and there are only 2 bathing pools. The shampoo provided is too oily. It can only be said that the advantage lies in the a**osphere of the decoration style, and the introduction of real hot spring water, and there are relatively few people.

Seriously complain about the Yangzhou bathing lady in the soup restaurant. Her skills are not very good, but her attitude is quite interesting. It feels like she puts herself in the position of a manager, as if I have to listen to her when I enter her territory. I chose a package of 198, which is not cheap. She said that you should choose the more expensive package B because you have acne on your back. I said I don’t want it, and then she said: Why are you so careless? Don't you despise yourself, and repeatedly said something like this to pua me. I asked back. Can you solve it by rubbing your back? She just shut up. She reminded me of the kind of distant relatives who would show up during the Chinese New Year. She put on the airs of an elder and pointed out her shortcomings. She has no sense of service at all, but she is quite high-minded. Due to poor workmanship and disgusting communication methods, the four of us who had to do the project were not happy to do it.

The breakfast is Japanese style. We ate breakfast twice, and the main dishes were not repeated. I heard that the dinner dishes are also very good. It's a pity that we were too late at Disney and didn't have a chance to experience it...
Next time you have a chance to go, you must make a special trip to soak in the hotel's hot springs and spend a leisurely day~

Environment: There is really nothing to say about this, there are not many people and it is very quiet. But the sound insulation of the room is not good, and the dehumidifier suddenly started, it was scary

Hygiene: This is not bad, clean. The soup side is also clean~

Facilities: The bathhouse is really small, but I always go there in the afternoon, and there are almost no one there. There is one bathing service person, so you need to queue up. The price is not bad for the environment. A single massage is 148, and there is a package of 198 that includes a bath + small items + back tapping. It is a good choice after a day at Disneyland. The spa is in line with the price of the hotel, more than 500 for 60 minutes, it must be not cost-effective

msg:The room is very nice, and there are a lot of delicious food. The breakfast is not as rich as expected, but it can definitely fill you up. However, the service really did not meet expectations. I checked in at the store at 1:30, and I gave a room first, saying that in order to facilitate our travel together, the other room was connected to us. We waited for a long time in the already opened room. I haven't given another room at half past one. I asked many times and said it was still being cleaned up. Finally, I was given the second room after urging back and forth at 3:30. Because the hotel announced that check-in was after 2 o'clock, we tried our best to express our understanding at 2:30 o'clock, but it was not until 3:30 o'clock. I was really not satisfied with this service.
When I went to the soup, the staff was also very impatient. I saw in the cabinet that you can ask the staff for underwear bags, so I asked, but they asked me several times. What do you say? As it was written, an old employee came and brought it to me. After taking a bath, I took a towel. First I took the towel for the upper body, and then the towel for wiping the lower body. The old man at home didn’t know that I could take two towels, so I only wiped the upper body, so I went to lift her to take the towel for the lower body. The personnel told me that we are not enough for ourselves, and there is no more. The towels are all there, and I'm not blind. If you think that a guest can only take two towels, you can explain it in a friendly manner instead of using this method and tone.
As a resort hotel, Million Rock has a lot to offer, but the details determine success or failure. We hope to provide more considerate service to every customer.

After getting off at the Disney station by subway, you can take the tourist line 1 shopping village station and get off at the shopping village station. The hotel is next to the station, which is very convenient. The environment of the hotel is Japanese style, not many people, very comfortable, the design of the room is also very modern, it is my favorite style, there is my favorite capsule coffee in the room, mineral water can also be added at any time, two beds can be shared In one, we sleep comfortably with two babies. There are also vending machines in the hotel to buy Japanese snacks and instant noodles. We haven’t eaten dinner in Disney these days, so it’s just right to buy noodles and soda here at night for supper. The hotel service is also very considerate. When we were traveling, the front desk upgraded us to a room with private soup, bath salts and disposable membranes. The two children were very comfortable taking a bath in it when they were tired of playing. Although there are not many types of breakfast in the hotel, the products are very good, especially the noodles are delicious 😋 I stayed for three days, and the breakfast for the three days had different varieties. Overall, it's very good, and I will book this hotel next time I come to Disney

Secondly, the constant electricity card in the hotel room is worth recommending to everyone. It is hot in summer. Sweating profusely, before even getting to the room, it was cool in the aisle leading to the room. The environment is very comfortable, super nice, and the supporting facilities are also very complete. The most worth mentioning is that the smart toilet is super comfortable, the mineral water of Voss is unlimited, and the mung bean sago dew is provided every day in summer. The sanitation is also very good. We went to Disneyland early in the morning, and when we came back in the evening, the room was very, very tidy, and the shoes were neatly arranged. The hotel is very spacious and large, relatively clean and elegant, making people not irritable. This is what really fits the word vacation. But one of the biggest disadvantages is that the takeaway cannot be delivered to the hotel. If you want to go a long distance from the hotel, you need to walk in for takeaway yuan, but many riders don’t deliver, so those who like to order takeaway should be cautious. Another disadvantage is that there is no paper drawer in the room. It is inconvenient to wipe your hands after eating.

msg:Seeing a group buying event, I quickly stocked up. Although I am in Shanghai, I have been planting grass in this hotel for a long time, and I finally stayed in it
We arrived after 12 o'clock, and we can check in directly when we arrive. From the moment we enter the door, someone will help us with our luggage. After checking in, we will also help us bring our luggage to the room. Along the way, we will introduce where to eat, where to shop, and where to soak in hot springs.
The room is large, with sensor lights in the corridor, and a large dehumidifier, very clean, smart toilet, and two capsule coffees. The only downside may be that there are only two bottles of free water, and there are only two bottles in the minibar. There is a charge, and I would like to make a small suggestion that the capsule coffee can have creamer. In the past, the capsule coffee in the hotel in Japan used to be served with creamer. It is too high for children to wash their hands, which is inconvenient.
The most satisfying thing is the service. The staff will greet you enthusiastically when you meet on the road. If you accidentally sprained your foot, the staff will come over to help you up immediately and disinfect it with iodophor. Unfortunately, the hot spring can’t be used, but my husband and son did. I don't even want to come out anymore. I get free wagashi when I check in, and mung bean soup at night
You can take the bus to Disneyland at the entrance of the hotel. Annual card users go to Disneyland at night. Now the hot weather in summer and the hours of queuing for amu*****t items, it is very comfortable to go shopping at night. The opposite is Bicester, and it is convenient to buy and buy.
The overall stay is very satisfactory, and I will come again next time!

Environment: Very good. There are two-story small houses with few rooms on each floor, so the isolation effect is really good. The hotel is just across the road from Bicester, which is very convenient for shopping and eating.
Service: Praise to the restaurant waiters, especially when the set meal is used at noon, they are not neglected at all because it is not a la carte, and they feel at home. However, the service of the two aunts in the hot spring is questionable. I really don’t like the feeling that you wipe your body naked and she keeps staring at you. In addition to recommending bathing services, there is no sense of service.
Likes: breakfast, lunch, aromatherapy in the room, blue sky and white clouds outside the bed, quiet sleeping environment.
Summary: The price of summer vacation is much cheaper than that of winter vacation and Chinese New Year, and the price is good.

However, he didn’t seem to understand Chinese and continued to sell me. I was speechless. This store felt like it was not a good place to get points.

The hotel showed no sympathy and care at all the next day after the accident. Construction work was even carried out during the breakfast rush hour. There was no safety reminder or staff supervision at all. There was no safety awareness at all! This is a hotel recommended by Ctrip, which is simply incomprehensible.

msg:A hot spring hotel close to Disney. It's the rainy season, when you check in, there will be a vic butler to pick you up, and the vic butler will take care of you in every possible way. The hotel's indoor and outdoor hot springs are exquisite and beautiful, with a feeling of being drunk and listening to the wind and rain. The dinner service is more thoughtful, especially the desserts are refreshing and not greasy. The Japanese style in the room is strong, and the hotel's additional services such as renting kimonos are full of experience. It was a very pleasant stay

The environment of the hotel is also very good, it feels like I really went to Japan. We can see the Disney Castle from our room. Outside the window is a lavender garden, but it's not the season. The hotel bathing is also very good, and the service is very attentive. It's just that the indoor lights of the soup house are slightly brighter, which is a little embarrassing. The hotel also helped us upgrade the room, which was really a super satisfying stay. Ps. The food is delicious, breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner are very attentive.

msg:A very satisfying hotel experience. I went to the hot springs on the day of check-in. There are not many hot springs, but they are very delicate, very clean, and there are few people. It is said that the hot spring water is shipped from Jiangsu. It is worthy of being the No. 1 hot spring in Shanghai. I felt that I was slippery all over, and I had a massage, went to a spa, and had a good rest. After all, the next day is going to fight against Disney, so I have to treat myself first. After soaking in the soup, I will enjoy the sunset Swinging on the swing is really pleasant. Next to it is the Lavender Paradise. I think it should be quite beautiful, but I was too tired that day, so I didn't go shopping. I went to the restaurant for a Japanese meal. It is exquisite, clean, good service, and fresh ingredients. I went to Disneyland to stay at the Paradise Hotel before, but the environment of the hot spring hotel is much better than that of the Paradise Hotel. Whether it’s food, accommodation, all aspects are very good, whether it’s the hotel’s shuttle bus or public transportation, it’s very convenient. I just go to experience it once, but I can come to this hot spring hotel N times. The teammates are also very satisfied with this arrangement. After all, it is already very hard to go to Disneyland with the baby. Come out to play and everyone is happy to be really happy! Of course, I am also very happy. The opposite is the Bicester Shopping Village. After eating, I will go shopping and do some shopping. I think there is nothing happier than shopping😜

The whole hotel is a typical Japanese courtyard style. Walking in the garden-like interior of the hotel has a feeling of being in Japan. Only in the lobby, when the service staff communicate in Shanghai dialect, do they realize that this is Allah Shanghai. Tickets for the Bliss Soup are free. The biggest advantage is that there are few people, and it is comfortable to soak for half an hour.

On the whole, the hotel rooms are so-so. This price mainly buys the experience, the surrounding environment of the hotel and the hot spring experience.

I bought a package with a mini double bed room. I arrived at the hotel in the morning. I thought I would be able to check in in the afternoon. The lady at the front desk welcomed me warmly and even upgraded the twin room for free. It was an unexpected surprise.
After check-in, go straight to the hot spring, and the staff greets you warmly with a smile on your face. The characteristic of Japanese hot springs is naked bathing. Soaking in the hot spring pool after showering is comfortable. It is said that it is a soft water hot spring, which is less irritating to the skin. The water quality is checked every hour, and I feel very at ease.
Going back to the room, the capsule coffee machine makes a cup of coffee, which is really pleasant.
In the afternoon, go shopping in Bicester opposite, and after returning to the hotel, soak in a hot spring to relieve fatigue, and have a good night's sleep!

Located in the Disney Resort, opposite the Bicester Shopping Village, next to the gate is the bus shopping village station, it is very convenient to arrive by car or bus.
We went to the hotel to check in early on the first day and store our luggage. The service at the front desk was very fast, and then we packed lightly and took the bus at the door to Disneyland. After playing all day, we took the bus back to the hotel at night and went to the front desk to get it immediately. The room card and welcome snacks are beautiful and delicious.
After breakfast the next day, go to the hot spring to soak in the hot spring, and there is a free drink for each person. I also went to the park to play with my children. I said that the swing there is very good, you can lie down and swing in the sun.
Check out at noon, then continue to store your luggage at the concierge at the front desk, and then go to the opposite side to visit Bicester. You are almost tired after shopping for 2 hours. Just when you arrive at the hotel for afternoon tea, you will go back to the hotel to enjoy the package. afternoon tea. The content of the afternoon tea is good, it looks like it is freshly made, not a finished product bought from outside, and the tea is also freshly brewed.
Finally, go back to the front desk to pick up your luggage and leave the store. You can take a taxi or take a bus to the subway station of Line 11 when you go home.
In short, this night's hotel is very cost-effective, the hotel environment is good, the service is good, and it is convenient to enter and exit.
My 2 days and 1 night arrangement includes food, accommodation, transportation, entertainment and shopping. Filling but not tiring.
This hotel can be said to be very suitable for daily leisure and relaxation without leaving Shanghai. It is also very suitable for tourists from other places to play Disney, the key point is that it is convenient and not tiring.

But the friend who was in the room directly encountered the cleaning staff who pushed in the door and refused to go out. After talking to each other, you were still cursing at the door. The most disgusting thing was that the front desk called the room instead of apologizing but asking you why you didn't leave.
It's obvious that the hotel's management is in disarray and the handover is a problem, but they still come to question the guests.

msg:The overall environment and experience are great, but if you are attracted by the low-priced package, don’t go there. After all, it’s a hotel that specializes in private hot springs, and the public bath facilities are very general. Therefore, you can either spend a lot of money to buy a room type with hot springs, or Don't join in the fun 😂

The environment is good, the catering is acceptable, and the transportation to and from Disney is also convenient. Overall, it is well received.

Or just don't do this project and directly tell the hotel guests about the bus route. If you do this project, you still need to set the shuttle time.

The service is very good, the front desk is well-trained, and the luggage is directly pulled on and off the car. The bedding is comfortable. It's just that the door can't be closed, and the master quickly repairs it. The room on the first floor faces the path and the lake, which lacks a bit of privacy. Overall management is good. It is recommended ♨️ to bring a bathrobe or a large towel for the guests. It is really cold outdoors, and the children's playground is enough to play. Breakfast sushi is OK, others are so-so.

msg:Located next to Bicester, 5 minutes walk away, very convenient for dining and shopping, not far from Disney. Surrounded by parks and water systems, the hotel has a beautiful environment. The overall is a small Japanese-style building with a large floor area and relatively new facilities and equipment. There are 2 bottles of VOSS drinking water in the room, but it is surprising that other drinks in the refrigerator need to be paid for. The price of the room is not enough to drink freely? The toiletries are all branded, which can be praised. The room has floor heating, so it should be more comfortable to live in winter. But the sound insulation is not good. In the middle of the night, I can still hear the sound of the TV and the sound of talking in the upper, lower, left, and right rooms. It interferes with sleep, and the experience is greatly reduced. Hot spring hotels are naturally indispensable for hot springs. The room rate includes two large and one small hot spring tickets, and you can go to the hot spring hall for free. Although they are all bliss soup, this one is much smaller than the regular bliss soup place. There is only one large pool indoors and two small pools outside. Maybe the flow of people is not enough to support a large soup restaurant. Moreover, the hot spring hall really only has hot springs, and there are no leisure, entertainment and dining facilities like the regular bliss soup. You can only come out after soaking in it, almost like a high-end bathhouse. It is recommended to provide unlimited bathing for customers staying in the restaurant. For example, if you are hungry after soaking, go out to eat, and the experience of strolling around and coming back to soak again is much better. After all, there are no items in the restaurant. Other items in the hotel are also very limited, there are a few claw machines (it costs 5 coins for one catch, is it appropriate?), there are a few swings outdoors, and there are ducks in the small lake to the north, that's all. Moreover, the food and beverages are very expensive. After looking at the menu, you may not be able to beat 500 yuan per person for casual meals. It is better to go to Bicester across the road, where there are more choices. But the breakfast is really good, very rich, and there is no extra money for children, the food standard is at least much higher than that of Disney hotels.

After checking out the next day, you can soak again on the same day. This service is great. The hotel also provides a free shuttle bus to Disney, which is convenient and the car is very clean.
The service is also unrivaled. The cleaning aunt at the soup place is very enthusiastic and offered to pour water for me several times for me to drink. There are few people in Tangchi and the cleaning is very clean. There are no recreational facilities, so it is suitable for a quiet bath, very relaxing!
The food in the buffet breakfast is also very good, variety, fresh and tasty.
The only small disadvantage is that the sound insulation is average. After 10 o'clock, you can hear the footsteps and noise of other guests upstairs.
The overall standard is very good, especially the attentive service, and I will come again next time.

Only turn on the floor heating to sleep at night and the lower bed and the room will be cold again. The toilet has no door, and it will be colder when taking a shower. But now that the weather is warmer, it's not a big problem. From the service to the experience of the whole hotel, everything else is great. The kids love it.

This time it is a guest room on the second floor of Building 2, which is slightly smaller than the room on the first floor of Building 5 last time, but the view outside the window is much better. It is a small pond with many ducks swimming around.

The Japanese-style soup restaurant of Jiletang is still very good. The soup is very comfortable. I prefer the outdoor soup pool. There are few people and the clean environment is good, and the waiter's service is also very good.

The breakfast at Million Stones All-Day Restaurant is also ok. There are not many choices but the taste is good. Japanese meals are still very distinctive, and the sushi is quite delicious. The last time I came, there was a free afternoon tea, and the appearance is also very good.

It is still a good choice to come to Disney to stay. Compared with Disneyland Hotel and Toy Story Hotel, it lacks Disney elements and early access card service, but the hot spring is the main feature.

Opposite is Bicester, walk for two or three minutes, it's good to go shopping.

msg:It was a very good experience. It happened that my husband was entangled in coming and going on his birthday, so he chose a hot spring hotel not far from home. On the one hand, it is close to Disney and Bicester, and my baby and I can be satisfied at one time. On the other hand, the Japanese hot spring is also a factor that attracts us.
It happened to be my husband's birthday, so I upgraded the room type, and there is a tatami area where the baby likes to draw and drink milk. The room is not big, but very warm and comfortable to live in. We stayed at the end of February, and it wasn't very humid. It was very comfortable to turn on the heat properly, but it was very hot when it was turned on. The room provided robes which were very comfortable to wear.
The whole hotel is very Japanese-style, and I felt like I was in Japan when I first came in. Children's facilities are outdoors, with several swings, trampolines, and slides, simple but safe. It is not suitable before and after rainy days, but the big lawn is very comfortable to bask in the sun when the weather is good.
The hot springs are separated for men and women. They are not big, to be precise, they are relatively small, and they may also be linked to check-in, so the whole area is not big. It's not bad if there are friends in the same industry to bubble together. But I am somewhat deserted by myself. It is said that the father and husband were in a mess with the baby. It would be even better if there is a family private soup that can be reserved. You can get a box of milk after taking a bath, which is very good. However, my aunt did not comment that the service was good and she would blow my hair or something. Knowing that I didn't need to rub my back, I just chatted with a few people there, and hurriedly cleaned up at night. In addition, it would be great if the hot spring time can be later. Disney watched the fireworks at 10 o'clock, and the hot spring just ended. I was so tired after playing for a day that I wanted to take a bath...
A reservation system is implemented for catering, because I have two coupons, so I have two afternoon teas, and I have made reservations three days in advance for the first and third days, and the waiter hurriedly said to take my afternoon tea at breakfast the next day It’s also used. I can come directly in the afternoon. I repeatedly emphasized that I made an early reservation for the next day... Alas, the service is good but I’m a little anxious... I had breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea, and they were all ok. The breakfast was very good The Japanese style has sushi curry and udon noodles, which is very similar to the breakfast in Osaka.
Overall it is still recommended! especially when there is price activity

The hotel upgraded the room type for free, and gave toothbrushes, bathrobes and souvenirs when I checked in. The room is very large and spacious, the floor heating is very comfortable, and the sanitation is also very large. The hotel has the scale of a small village, and the surrounding scenery is very Japanese. The hot spring is under the banner of Jiletang. The indoor structure completely reproduces the Japanese-style hot spring. There are no extra entertainment activities. The indoor is the Yintang hot spring from Taixi, and the outdoor
It is soft water, and a carton of milk will be given after soaking. There are many types of breakfast the next day, but only a feeling of fullness, and the taste is average. You can also soak once before checking out at 12 o'clock. The experience is in line with expectations, the breakfast is not very delicious, there is still room for improvement.

The hotel occupies a large area, the environment is good, the air is fresh, and the room has floor heating, which is very warm. That is, there are only two indoor and outdoor soup pools, which feel a little small, but fortunately there are not many people, so it is enough. You can also go to Disney Town in the surrounding area. The traffic is quite convenient, and there are more buses than expected. Anyway, I haven't waited for a long time for a bus. The breakfast is Japanese style and there are not many varieties, but the udon noodles are delicious, and a double set meal is included in the accommodation package, which is worth the price of the day.

msg:The 1288 special package booked on Ctrip is quite cost-effective, including breakfast, hot spring bath, afternoon tea and welcome gift. The room type is a mini Japanese-style double room. The room is indeed very mini. When we checked in, there was a problem with the lights in the room. The welcoming guy immediately helped us upgrade the room type, and the work was very efficient👍. The room comes with a hot tub and a capsule coffee machine. The free water is also good 😄. I went to the restaurant for afternoon tea at 2 pm. There were few people and it was quiet. The aunt who served was also very proactive and polite, and kept adding water for us. The quality of afternoon tea is also good, I especially like chips and salmon Tapas. Disadvantages: The water flow in the bathroom is not strong, it is uncomfortable to wash, the water pipe of the shower is hard, and it is a bit awkward to handle; when the water splashes on the metal baffle of the sewer, the sound is very loud, which is a major flaw in the design. I don't know what cheap brand the hair dryer is. The sound is very loud, unlike the Dyson hair dryer and L'Occitane washing and care brand mentioned in the reviews. Maybe it's because the room rate is not up to standard! Advantages: The location is advantageous. The No. 1 bus at the door takes three stops to the Disney subway station. The hotel also has a shuttle bus to Disney, which needs to be reserved in advance. Across the road is the Bicester Shopping Center, which opens at 10 in the morning. It is very convenient for shopping.

There are so few people that it is basically a private room, and the staff, whether it is the front desk or the hot spring waiter, are very nice! I tried the hotel's breakfast and dinner set menus (need to be booked in advance). The only disadvantage of breakfast is that there are not many choices. The whole fits my taste. I am too lazy to choose two large and one small set meals for dinner. The amount of food for two people is full. , but the taste is good for people who like Japanese food, and the price is a bit expensive; the location of the hotel is very good, just across the street from Bicester, which is very friendly to people who like to buy and buy, and can solve the problem of eating at the same time. For those who want to go shopping around Disney, it is also very convenient to take a direct bus. There are not many pools for hot spring experience, and I have also been to small local hot springs in Japan. The comparison is still not good, so the only thing that impresses me is the lack of people. Overall, the choice this time is still recommended, the relative price is high, but within the acceptable range

The hot spring part is a perfect copy of the Japanese hot spring. If it is for the hot spring alone, you can come. Let's talk about the shortcomings: the reception service at the front desk is shockingly bad. There is a middle-aged man in a suit and leather shoes who looks like a manager with a bad attitude. The hotel cannot order takeaway, and the takeaway boy will be stopped by the security guards in the park 5 kilometers away, and the electric car will not be allowed to enter. When I came back late at night, my child was hungry, so I went to the front desk to ask if I could have food delivered in the room, but the front desk didn't even lift an eyelid, and said coldly: there is no room for food delivery. 😨 You deserve to be called your own hotel? You don't even qualify as a hotel, do you? Also, the sound insulation of the room is extremely poor. The sound of children crying and the TV in the next room can be heard clearly.

Afternoon tea is so-so, with tea, four-grid snacks, French fries and ice cream with cakes.

msg:This hotel is amazing~ When you enter the building, you will be greeted by a fresh fragrance. The Japanese-style rooms have air-conditioning and floor heating. The floor heating is turned on when you enter the door. It is very comfortable to enter the room in cold weather. The hotel's toiletries are also very high-end . There are not many varieties of breakfast and it tastes good. There are not many hot spring pools and people, and the service is very good. The location of the hotel is still very good. The shuttle bus from Disney Metro takes 2 stops to the hotel entrance. If you are not used to Japanese food, it is also very convenient to eat in Yioulai across the road.

msg:The hotel is very grand. This feeling of grandeur is not only reflected in the layout, design, style, color, and courtyard landscape of the hotel's buildings, but also in the management and owner's business philosophy of accepting hundreds of guests. The hotel's hospitality can be reflected in every move. On the basis of not affecting others and the hotel's principles, you can help as much as you can, and you are not stingy or trying to please. It is just right and makes people feel comfortable. Not only can you feel the characteristics of Japanese service, but also feel the a**osphere of Shanghai. Stayed for the second time, and continue to praise. The epidemic is over, and the spring of the hotel is coming, come on.

The sound insulation of the room is not good, and the voices of the people next door can be clearly heard at night. 2. The water pressure in the shower is not strong, taking a bath is very laborious and wastes water. 3. The room is very hot, the air conditioner and the floor heating are not turned on, and it is still very stuffy. I live in a room on the first floor, and I dare not open the window, because people who open the window can go in and out directly, and the quilt is very thick. I don’t know why , It was hot in the bed, I didn't sleep well all night, and I sweated a lot. Bathing is very comfortable, there are not many people, but the rest area is a bit small, just a table, a few futons and beanbags, and more entertainment equipment. The movie theater has not opened yet, saying that the qualification has not yet been applied for. It would be even better if there are more supporting facilities such as food courts and shopping streets. After all, housing prices are not cheap.

The service of the hotel is very good, especially in the hot springs. My daughter had been in the hot springs for a long time and suddenly passed out. The two waiters were very enthusiastic. They poured water and towels and fed sugar, which quickly made my daughter recover. I will remind other guests to pay attention later~
The hotel also has a children's play area, next to the hot spring, swinging or something

Unexpectedly, I can watch fireworks in the room, and there are extra shows during the Spring Festival. I watched two shows at 8:00 and 9:15, and I made money. The dinner set menu is very delicate, you can’t get enough without additional dishes, the price is not very conscientious, and the quality can be guaranteed. The private soup is very mini, similar to a local hotel in Japan, with few people and clean, you must experience it, pure bathing, no entertainment or food, except for coin-operated claw machines and ice cream machines.

msg:The location of the hotel is easy to find, and the location is smooth. The hotel has its own parking space. Generally, there is no problem with parking for staying guests. We went there on the first day of the new year, and the road was not blocked.
The hotel is Japanese-style, and the family room I booked has two large beds + two small beds. The small bed is generally large enough for those under 1.65m to sleep, and the large bed can be combined into a super large bed, which is very comfortable. The room has floor heating and air conditioning, so it won't be too hot. The room has a small refrigerator, coffee machine, kettle, and speakers, which basically meet the needs of life. When checking in, I gave the children breakfast. The breakfast is more Japanese style, and there are not many varieties, but I like it very much. I have tea and rice, and I am satisfied!
The hotel is not too big, the highest floor is 2 floors, and the entrance to the room is raised, which is pretty good! The hot spring ends at 10:00 in the evening, because it is in the hotel, so the hot spring rest area is not big, there is no order service, there is a snack cabinet, and each bracelet can receive a drink: milk, Sprite, Coke!
The hotel is just across the road from Bicester. Both eating and shopping are good. The only downside is that the takeaway can't be delivered, and you have to go to the service area to pick it up, which is a bit troublesome!
Overall not bad!

Usually, there are more than 2,000 calendar rooms, and now a set of 1288 includes breakfast and afternoon tea. The style and service of the whole hotel are like those in a Japanese hot spring hotel. When I checked in on weekdays, the guy at the front desk upgraded the room. The room is clean and tidy, and has the unique fragrance of hot spring hotels. It is especially suitable for bringing the whole family to the hotel in winter. There are two baths for men and women in the bliss soup, and there are two hot spring pools in the women's soup, both indoors and outdoors. The towels are clean and you can use them with confidence. The overall health status is very good, especially thanks to sister JUDY, 👍.

After telling the receptionist that this was an elegant twin room, they later called me and said they could help me move to Building 5, but I I had already gone out and came back very late, so I was so happy. In addition, the service was okay, but there was no kind of heartfelt greetings and smiles. It was far from the hotels in Sanya. The breakfast was so-so, so I went to get something to eat with my baby. When I came back, I found that the tables were already being cleared. This was so unpleasant. Although I helped get food later, I understood that it was past 9:30 and would end at 10 o'clock, but I felt that it was really bad to get off work in a hurry, and there was a table on the table. I haven't eaten a lot of them yet. I just took my baby to get coffee. I hope the Japanese-style service can be better, so that the hotel can go further

It takes about 5-10 minutes to take the shuttle bus to the Donald Duck parking lot. Take public transportation No. 70 in front of the hotel. It takes 2¥3 stops to reach the public transportation hub near Disney Town. It is very suitable for walking. Small town fast track friends. Compared with Disney hotels, except that there are no Disney elements, the price/performance ratio, location and environment are all superb. The most important thing is that the staff (front desk, catering, concierge, etc.) are responsible, very polite, and approachable. They also gave valuable advice on ordering takeout, which avoided a lot of trouble. The breakfast is fresh, healthy, simple, and delicious, and the dining environment is spacious and quiet. Super satisfied! I really recommend friends who want to go to Disney to stay here. You can have a good rest without worrying about traffic inconvenience!

It is super convenient for eating and shopping. After shopping, you can soak in a hot spring... It's like a fairy! The hotel is very quiet. It is a wise move to choose this place instead of the Paradise Hotel and various homestays when going to Disney this time!

There are several restaurants in Bicester Shopping Village that can provide meals. We have a Dayton was settled in Yerichali, which is economical! 2.

The hotel's afternoon tea, I personally think it is average, mainly because of the tea The standard is lacking, and the teabag is given; the breakfast is compared to others. Five-star hotels, although there are fewer simple varieties, but the overall quality is good, there are salmon, cod, noodles, porridge, bread... 4. When it comes to the most important soup, because it is only for hotel guests, there are few people, basically belongs to The whole hot spring restaurant is not big, the only thing lacking is that the resting place is too small, there are only two tables, and many introductions say that there is iced milk, just saying. You can scan a bottle of milk in the beverage machine with your card (or you can choose iced cola). Personally, I think the price of the room coupon is around 1300, but the price of the calendar room is around 2700. The service of this hotel is not good, so I was a little nervous when I came here, but I think every waiter is very polite, and they will take the initiative to say hello when they see it. It is very good. If the price is still available, I will come again!

The handsome guy at the front desk of the hotel thoughtfully helped us upgrade to a big room with a view of the water. I felt warm in my heart. Adults are obsessed with hot springs, and children are fond of the swings, slides and trampolines next to the hot springs. Because of the epidemic, the number of employees in the hotel is much less than last month, but the environment of the whole hotel is still so clean and the service is still so attentive. Some five-star hotels went there once I don’t want to go again, it’s just a reputation, but the Million Stone Hot Spring Hotel is the first choice of hotels I want to come back to.

There are two types of pools: the open-air soft water pool and the indoor silver hot spring pool. They are not very big, but fortunately there are not many people. The indoors are a little stuffy, but the outdoors are just right. It’s comfortable to rinse off after soaking, but you’ll feel a little dizzy after soaking for a long time☺️ By the way, the business hours of the ♨️ hall are from 10 am to 10 pm. Tenants can go to soak at any time. My dad went Several times, every time I handed him water to take disposables and bathrobes, the service of the male soup is much better than that of the female soup~🤔
The small lawn that comes with the hotel has a swing canopy and a smaller children's playground. Although the hot spring is small, it has everything it should have; the buffet breakfast is not full, and you can eat a few more rounds; the room is quite clean The activity space is not too small, but the sensor lights in the corridor are too smart, and there is no response when the floor heating is turned on. Fortunately, it has not been cold these two days; the service is okay, very enthusiastic, and the basic requirements can be met. There is a big garden and lawn next to the hotel. You can use your room card to enter the park. No one is very suitable for walking and digesting food. I like it~❤️
Also, it rained heavily on the night of check-in and we wanted to order a meal at the hotel restaurant. Unfortunately, we were told that we could not enter (or wait until after 8 o'clock) when the appoin**ent was full, so we had to brave the heavy rain and go to the opposite side of Bicester to find food. It is suggested that when checking in, we can remind us that the restaurant is not big and there are not many tables. We need to make an appoin**ent in advance, instead of just telling the location of the restaurant. After all, we asked the hotel restaurant if we can eat at night.

As far as the environment and service are concerned, it is really good and very satisfactory, especially on non-weekends and working days. There are few, but unfortunately, the maintenance and repair of the outdoor hot spring pool is scheduled for this day. Only indoor hot springs are open. However, there are really not many hot springs, so there are only two indoor and one outdoor. It is relatively simple, but for the only open words for hotel accommodation customers, it is still less crowded and cleaner, and it feels cleaner in terms of hygiene, especially the aunties in the hot spring hall are very enthusiastic, they take the initiative to help us blow our hair, and the sauna is also good. The tea was delivered. I have to say that the hotel is still very attentive in terms of staff service. The staff at the front desk are also very kind. The hotel has not cleaned the room at 12:30 noon. It is still OK, let us wait for a while , the door leading to the lavender that day was locked and it was useless to swipe the door card. I asked the waiter that there was nothing to see in this season. Simple and simple style, the ground is very clean, there is no dirty soles or gray layers when walking barefoot, but there are no toiletries and wooden combs in the room, and the room attendant at the front desk will deliver them quickly at night.

msg:This week I went to the Million Stone Hot Spring Hotel in Disney, which belongs to the high-end hotel brand of Jiletang. Parking and entering the hotel is a strong neon feeling. Hot spring town, drug store, kimono shop...
[Service experience] It continues the highest service standards of Japanese hot spring hotels, which can be reflected in many details such as meals and service attitudes. Even the uncle next to the soup pool can think of what you think and serve enthusiastically.
 
[Room facilities] In Japanese-style rooms, the TVs are hidden inside the small sliding doors. Thinking of the time when I booked a century-old store without TVs in Kyoto, I can understand their good intentions... The room has sufficient floor heating. It looks like 5 or 6 degrees in the sky, but you can wear short sleeves in the room. The small stereo is playing "Kikujiro's Summer", if the TV can watch nhk, it will be more like that
 
[Meal quality] At present, the hotel has a package with room and meal, which is very cost-effective. Meals need to be pre-booked in advance. There are appetizer platters, salads, fried chicken, sukiyaki, desserts, and some sashimi, sushi, and wine are enough. I ate slowly with my friends for two hours, feeling like kaiseki cuisine haha.
[Tang Quan] My friend from the north told me something bad: there is no place to take a bath! Ha ha ha ha. Others are empty because they are only open to in-house guests. Soaking in the outdoor bath, looking at the cold sky, anyway, this kind of comfortable feeling has never been experienced in chain stores outside.
By the way, the hotel is opposite Bicester Village.

The most amazing thing is the hotel's breakfast! It's the best hotel breakfast I've ever had, and everything is delicious. The hotel has a door leading directly to the Lavender Paradise, although there are no flowers and plants in this season. The only thing that is not so good is the aunt in the hot spring place, who stares closely at the whole process, which makes people feel uncomfortable.

msg:Overall it's pretty good. I checked in on Friday. I upgraded the room type. The room is larger and the child can sleep on the sofa. It's similar to a Japanese western-style room. Would it be better if tatami mats are provided? There are yukatas in the room, which is convenient for bathing. It's very considerate to have a coat when it's cold . There are no hot springs in Shanghai, but soft water is used. In the Bliss Soup, there are indoor and outdoor pools, and men and women are separated. When we went, no one was there, and we were still chatting with my husband outside through the wall. Breakfast is a Japanese buffet, plus points. The most surprising thing is that the front desk staff and the restaurant manager are all from Shanghai, and they have service experience in five-star hotels in the city. There are swings and children's leisure by the side of the bath, so there is no need to go to the rabbit's nest to be crowded. By the way, the hotel has a small door leading directly to the lavender manor. There is no one. Although the season is not right, the experience is excellent. Million Stone is worth recommending.

msg:The hotel is good overall, the room is Japanese style, there is a car to pick you up and go, the hot spring is also very comfortable, although the smell of disinfectant is still very strong. Because there are few people, I reserved the place by myself when I went there, and it was very free to soak up. I just hope that the hotel can improve it and provide the room with a pair of slippers for going out to the bath, otherwise it would be too troublesome to go to the bath.
Then write about the set meal. This set looks like a lot of things. In fact, there are only two things added, a meal and a chance to hang a doll. As for other free things, there will be some if you don’t buy the set meal. I feel that writing it is not very sincere. , The set meal I chose for dinner, the quantity is okay, the taste is quite satisfactory...
Finally, write about the other paid parts. I paid for the afternoon tea myself, which was different from the one on the leaflet. Some desserts were replaced without any explanation, so they were just served to me. . . Because it is winter, there are yukatas in the room, and if you want to borrow a kimono, you need to pay 800 once. You can choose to return the clothes to them the next day, but you can only wear them once. You can think about it for yourself...

msg:A satisfying experience!
I have been planting grass for a long time, and finally had the opportunity to bring my parents to stay once. Ctrip has a discount of about 2,000 a night. The location of the hotel is excellent. In the Disney Resort, there is a shuttle bus to Disney. Opposite the hotel is Bicester Shopping Village, inside the hotel There is an inner door directly to enter the Shanghai Lavender Garden, and even the tickets are free 😝 You can enjoy the endless flower sea
The hotel is mainly Japanese-style, but the rooms and the private rooms of the restaurant are Western-style. The rooms are relatively ordinary, but they are clean and hygienic (the second floor is a little unpleasant)
The public bath in the hotel is only open to hotel guests, and there are very few people in the afternoon; it can almost be reserved, and there are more aunties serving than guests. There are three or four indoor and outdoor pools, as well as dry steam rooms. The waiter and aunt are very enthusiastic. It makes people feel like they are in a high-end private soup served by several aunties. The dry steam room is always open even if no one is there, and the layout is very clean. It can be said that even if there are not many guests in this hotel, the service and facilities are not stingy. very rigorous and in place
There is a campsite after the hot spring. The hotel is arranged for children to play with. There are not many things for children to play with. This is just to attract less parents with children and let everyone enjoy the private soup more cleanly😎
Breakfast is a buffet, more Japanese style, a bowl of miso soup with rice and grilled fish is very satisfying
The service at the front desk of the hotel is also very good, and the requirements of the guests will be satisfied very sincerely
Although the price is a bit expensive for the room, the main value lies in the hotel's hot spring facilities and location. After soaking in the soup and eating Japanese food, go shopping in a European-style town, or take pictures and camp in the sea of flowers, focusing on high-end Japanese-style private soup. The experience is very suitable for taking parents to rest and relax. I am very satisfied with this experience and will visit again if I have the opportunity!

Unlimited hot springs, we went to soak once on the first night, and then again before checking out the next morning

Facilities and services are very Japanese, comfortable.
Several good friends went with their babies, all of whom were boys. Dad took the campsite for a run, took a bath after running, and went back to the room comfortably to play a game together. Mothers can get the best relaxation here. After soaking the skin, go back to the room and chat until high. The best way to relax on weekends.
Definitely a place to brush often.

First-class service attitude From the front desk to the soup market, all the service staff are dedicated, polite and gentle. The service aunts in the soup market are very gentle and enthusiastic. They always came to bring me water during the soup, especially Aunt Tulip who also carefully dried my hair. I like the smell of toiletries 😘.
There is nothing to say about the natural environment. As can be seen in the picture, there is no post-production, pure original film 👍.
The only flaw is probably the catering. The food is average. From breakfast to afternoon tea, the chefs can still be better when selecting ingredients.
Finally, I will bring my family again. I hope the hotel will keep opening at a standard level~

They gave a friend an ice cream waffle as a small gift during breakfast, which was very thoughtful. All in all, it was a happy and fulfilling weekend trip, and the hotel is a paradise in Shanghai.

msg:Million Stone Hot Spring Hotel, one sentence review: Japanese-style courtyard, private open-air bath, exquisite refreshment dishes, travel to neon in minutes~
Shenxian Hotel deserves specific reviews (as follows):
Friends have stayed and recommended it, and I have been planting grass for a long time. When the Ctrip 919 activity group is over, the package can be booked directly online for instant confirmation. The package is a 25 square bed room, and you can directly upgrade to a 35 square bed room with a lake view at the front desk of the hotel, great!
The waiter led to the room and introduced various facilities warmly on the way. The hotel occupies a large area, with several two- and three-story buildings. You can enter by swiping the room card. It is safe and private. The air is fragrant. With soothing music, you can enjoy the welcome and fruit.
I rented a yukata at the tea house for 398 yuan, which can be worn out of the hotel and returned before 6 pm. Write a wish-painting horse in front of the wishing wall, and wish the epidemic will dissipate as soon as possible, the economy will recover, and everyone will be happy.
I ate dinner in Bicester, opposite the hotel, and watched the fountain for a while. After dinner, I went back to my room to change into a bathrobe. There are two colors for adults, light-colored goldfish and dark-colored plum blossoms. I chose plum blossoms, which made me look thinner. Off to Bliss Soup!
When night fell, I saw little frogs (?) and egrets over the wild lake on the road. The ecology was really good. This Bliss Soup is a private soup and is only open to guests. The business hours are from 10 to 20 o'clock. You can drink it at will with your room card, and there are free drinks after you soak it. Female soup has two indoor soups and two outdoor soups. The indoor silver soup is said to be transported from the groundwater of Shaxi. It is rich in trace elements and has health benefits. The outdoor soft water is friendly to sensitive skin. The auntie in the hot spring was very kind, helping to blow hair, tie belts, and hand towels, which was very touching. After soaking ♨️ it is easy.
The next day, I slept until I woke up naturally, and enjoyed a Japanese-style buffet breakfast with a wide variety of varieties. We recommend grilled salmon sushi and boiled food. Late check-out until two o'clock, there is plenty of time to go to Bicester to buy and buy. Surprise with a small gift upon check out. I ate the 268 yuan Yunrong Afternoon Tea in the set menu. The plate was super beautiful~, with a sweet aftertaste, and ended a pleasant two days and one night.

msg:A very distinctive hot spring hotel, it is also a rare Japanese-style bathing experience in Shanghai and even the whole country. I have seen a lot of Chinese-style hot springs and hot spring hotels that seek greatness and perfection. Some are upgraded bathhouses and bathing centers, and some hot springs are just to make soy sauce and add a selling point. In my opinion, here is a relatively simple hot spring bath to enjoy and rest, it is far from the city center, there are not many rooms and guests, and it pays more attention to quality and service.

surroundings:
The hotel is in a corner of the lavender park, the surrounding is very quiet and has an idyllic scenery. The buildings are all 2-3-storey small buildings, connected by 2-storey corridors, quiet and private. The interior decoration is also in the style of a Japanese hotel, with painted horses, dry landscape gardens, and Japanese garden lights, creating the a**osphere of a hot spring hotel. The room layout is similar to Japanese and Western style, and the decoration details are in place. The elegant double room we stayed in was very clean, with a separate tatami area, and we could see the hotel's inner lake through the large window. The vegetation in the park is lush. When I went there, the sweet-scented osmanthus bloomed, and I could smell the faint scent of sweet-scented osmanthus in the air.

facility:
This is a chain brand of Bliss Soup. There are few hot spring soup pools, separated by men and women. There are 4 indoor and outdoor pools, which are only open to hotel guests. Very clean, it is the cleanest public soup pool I have ever soaked in in China. When I went on Sunday, there were fewer guests, and the hotels that were originally escaping were even more quiet. The soup is basically a private restaurant, which is comparable to a private soup. The hotel also has suites with private soup, just choose according to your needs.
Japanese restaurant is another highlight of the hotel, known as Michelin level. We used their afternoon tea and breakfast and the quality is really good. Buffet breakfast, there are few choices, but there are all the basic categories, enough to eat. The freshly made beef udon noodles are delicious, and the grilled silver snowfish is also impressive.

Serve:
The service level is good, warm and professional. We arrived very early at noon, and the front desk checked in nicely in advance, upgraded the room, and added customer service WeChat, and the processing speed was very fast. The concierge guy took the initiative to carry the luggage, introduced the hotel facilities, and politely guided him all the way into the room. The service at the front desk is very good, and the few times of communication are quick response and problem solving.
The service in the hot spring is more "Japanese" in form, and because there are few guests, there is a feeling of exclusive service. The hot spring customer service must have received special training and will take the initiative to provide services. If there is a need for improvement, it is recommended not to be too "active". It's hard to imagine that in a Japanese hot spring, there will be waiters who take the initiative to pour water and take towels for guests. After all, this is a private occasion, and the sense of space is very important. If you serve me, I will be comfortable. Of course, the domestic culture is different, and the guests also need to be cultivated. The original intention of the manager can be understood, but this also has higher requirements for customer service, and it is necessary to master this measure.

Surrounding activities:
The hotel is not far from Disney, and there is a bus stop at the door. It is very convenient to take the hotel shuttle or the bus from the resort. Across the road is the Bicester outlet, which is convenient for shopping and dining.

Having said all that, I'm mainly ready to come again. The recent ups and downs of the epidemic, Disney has also turned on and off. I hope that the million stone will stick to it, it is not easy to find a serious place to soak in the soup in Shanghai 😎

The room is Japanese. There are tatami mats in it, which are very popular among children and adults. The bathroom is quite big. Too bad there is no bathtub. But you can go to the soup, and you can drink milk or cola after the soup. If you want to take a sauna, the staff can also help with babysitting.
Yi Ou Lai is just across the road from the hotel, you can go shopping, but there are more people on holidays. There is nowhere to eat except Yi Ou Lai. The hotel's own restaurant, you can order a set menu is relatively affordable (there are a lot of seafood). Swipe the room card to enter and exit the side door to enter the lavender garden.

But the hot spring is really comfortable, there are few people, almost reserved venues, the experience is really great! The afternoon tea served was lackluster, barely touched. Breakfast is still decent. The location is very good, opposite is Bicester. After shopping, take a hot spring, put away the spoils, and then go shopping. I would like to suggest whether you can give a large bath towel when you come out of the hot spring. They are all very small towels, which are very laborious to wipe. In addition, can you not charge for a baby cot in the future? Other hotels have never encountered such a thing as a baby cot fee! Overall praise, will come again in the future!

The breakfast is Japanese-style. I personally feel that the variety is not particularly rich, but the taste is outstanding. The grilled salmon sushi is delicious, and the service is also very good. Help with the noodles and pour the soy sauce. In short, it is a characteristic hotel worth recommending. There are lavender and rose gardens to stroll around, especially suitable for leisure vacations

msg:The second time I stayed at Million Stone, I felt that the service was upgraded again. Very warm and attentive. This time I chose the most basic room type, but I was pleasantly surprised. Although the room is not big, the functional areas are reasonably divided, and four friends do not feel crowded when they come to the room to sit and drink tea. The hotel's Japanese restaurant is said to have changed the chef team. I tried it at night. It is definitely the top Japanese food in the Disney Resort. The service manager of the restaurant is also the king of the service industry. He has achieved the ultimate Japanese service. Thank you very much. Overall, it was a very satisfactory stay experience, happy.

msg:On weekdays, I take children to play Disney at different peaks. This should be a very cost-effective hotel around Disney. Living in a Disney hotel (not counting Toy Story) is actually not cost-effective. It is mainly in the park during the day, and it is not cost-effective to go back to sleep at night, and if the peak is off, you can basically go in early in the morning without queuing and brushing again. The highlight of this hotel is that you can take a free hot spring when you stay in the hotel. The hotel environment is also very good. The back door leads directly to the lavender park, and the children in the rabbit nest can basically play for a long time. The breakfast in the hotel is Japanese style. I am used to eating Western-style Chinese breakfast. It is also very good to change the taste. The taste is also very good. The package includes afternoon tea. The children like it very much, and the portion is sufficient. It's a pity that this package was taken off the shelf after leaving the store. If there is such a package next time, I must stock up more.

msg:The hotel is located directly opposite Bicester, Disney Resort. It is very convenient to eat and shop. If you want to go to Disney, there is a tram at the door…
The whole hotel is quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle. The guest rooms are connected by two-story houses. The overall space of the guest rooms is very large, and the hygiene is very good. The facilities are still very new. There is no mold in the corners of the bathroom... Children wash in slippers There are bathrobes, because they are Japanese-style, so the washlet is standard. The make-up mirror in the bathroom has a heating function, and there will be no fog after taking a shower.
Let me talk about the service. On the day of arrival, the concierge took the initiative to unload the luggage. After checking in, the doorman took the electric car and sent it to the room. He was enthusiastic and proactive... The service of the clerk at the Bliss Soup was also very nice, and the female soup was very clean. Hair, Auntie is also very active to find a cabinet and open the sliding door for you to prepare underwear bags... It is estimated that you can only soak in the soup when you stay in the store, so it is very quiet and clean compared to the Bliss soup outside
The breakfast here is all Japanese-style, udon noodles, sushi, fried food, miso soup, rice curry, etc. It is worth mentioning that my husband got up at 10:10 late and came to the restaurant to find me. I didn't expect the clerk to take the initiative to run I came to ask what I needed to eat, and then went to the back kitchen to get two large plates of various dim sums, which is a plus for the hotel
On the whole, the hotel is still very Japanese. The soup setting is the same as that of a Japanese hot spring hotel. The main service can catch up with some domestic chain hotels.
As for the shortcomings, the sound insulation of the room is a bit poor. The children next door are expected to be very noisy when they go to Disneyland at 7 o'clock in the morning. If you can prepare footstools for children to wash in the public toilet and guest room, the design of the hotel faucet is very close to the inside. Our 120-year-old children still can't reach the hotel faucet switch.
And don't come to the soup in summer...I really sweated back to the room after the soak

Because I booked a standard room, and then the breakfast is two big and one small. After telling the front desk that an adult with two big children, the hotel was very considerate and gave us three adult buffet breakfasts when we checked in. The breakfast is Japanese. breakfast buffet.
The hotel is very close to Disney. After a day of playing in the hot springs, it was very comfortable, and each person was given a free bottle of milk. The aunt Tulip of the hot spring hall was super nice, and the service was very good. yukata tied with a nice bow.
If you can't go to Japan, but you want to experience a Japanese-style hot spring hotel, this is a good choice. If you want to eat, there is Bicester Shopping Village opposite the hotel, and there are many restaurants.

msg:Very surprising hotel, quite similar to the hot spring hotel in Japan. The hardware and software are very good, and the food is also very good.
For my husband's birthday, he helped us upgrade to a duplex suite for free. The kids really enjoyed the tatami upstairs. Free extra bed and breakfast for two and a half children. The boss is really nice.
The service far exceeds that of many five-star hotels. The front office manager's service was very enthusiastic. When he left, he even delivered a small gift to the door. The staff in the restaurant, guest room, and security depar**ent at the entrance of the project are also very friendly.
The breakfast is very suitable for our appetite. The fried mackerel, fried chicken and curry rice in our favorite Japanese breakfast are all of good quality. 888's dinner in the set menu is flawless. The prawns they recommend are average.
The design of the hot spring is exactly the same as in Japan, small but clean and not many people.
If you have to pick faults, one is that the slippers in the room do not match the overall standard, and the other is that the quilt is very damp and uncomfortable to cover.
If this level can be maintained, I will definitely come back to the hotel.

In the morning, I arrived at the advanced parking lot, and went directly to Disney for two stops by the bus. After walking 20,000 steps, I came back and soaked in hot water. It was really worth it. After eating the Japanese buffet breakfast the next day, across the road is Bicester. After buying and buying, the hotel has a rest and the return journey is very perfect. Golden designated location
The naive lucky meow at the entrance, the small and fresh Japanese-style courtyard, the cute little snails on the road after the rain, the carp streamers of the Bliss Soup ~ everything is so beautiful ~ the top female "Chuansha Daji" with good luck witnesses this. everything~

msg:It is the first stop hotel after the recovery of the epidemic. The location of the hotel is very good. You only need to cross the road to Bicester Shopping Center. The hotel has a back door that leads directly to the rabbit nest, which is really suitable for parents and children. The details of the hotel's environment are still good. It can be compared with hot spring hotels in Japan. It is very comfortable and quiet to walk at night, and there are no mosquitoes. I don't know how to do this. It's amazing.
In terms of meals, the hotel is still very expensive, and the all-Japanese breakfast won my heart, and the silver cod is all-you-can-eat. The 688 set dinner for three is also a great value. M9 beef sukiyaki, sashimi platter, grilled salmon sushi, the family is very satisfied.
In terms of service, the room uses L'Occitane toiletries, voss mineral water, the floor is clean and you can go barefoot, there is a fresh fan to circulate the air, the room is very spacious, and the tatami is very comfortable to sleep on. There are also Japanese snacks for children at the store.
Soup, it's really unbelievable. There are indoor and outdoor soup pools, and the soup is shipped from Nanchang to a real hot spring. In the summer night, I take a small soak in the outdoor bath for a while, I feel very relaxed, and sleep in seconds after soaking. The most worthy of praise is that it is really clean. After soaking and drinking a can of ice milk (free), it really seems to be in Japan. The hot spring aunt will also help the children blow their hair, which is really caring.
Bring the whole family to the soup when preparing for the new year.

Ctrip ordered a package of 2200, which includes a double room for one night, 2 large and 1 small package, breakfast, hot spring tickets, milk after bath, Disney business car transfer, and the price/performance ratio is still good.
Stayed twice at the Disney Hotel and thought it was cleaner. The traffic is really very convenient. The entrance is Tourism 1 Road, across the road is Bicester Shopping Village, and next to it is the Lavender Garden.
There are some facilities in the hotel that are still under construction and should be able to experience more next year.
We drive our car to the hotel and then take the hotel car to Disney early in the morning, which can save 100 yuan of parking fees, go back to the hotel and travel 1 road and 3 stops...
It is also more convenient to have nucleic acid points across the road.

It is very pleasant to take a bath in the courtyard and listen to the cicadas. Room hygiene is very clean. The hotel is very big, the staff are very enthusiastic, and the staff you see along the way will take the initiative to say hello. The transportation is very convenient, next to Disney. It is worth mentioning that the catering, the breakfast buffet is all Japanese, very delicate, the dining environment is comfortable and there are outdoor dining tables. We also ordered dinner at 688, enough for 3 people, fresh ingredients. It is also very comfortable to take a bath in summer, especially outdoors, the breeze is very cool.

🧹Sanitation: The Japanese-style room is quite large, and the details are very careful. Automatic sensor light for shoe changing hall. 3 Separate toilets, automatic toilets, Dyson hair dryers, and soft and clean bath towels.
🍃Environment: Entering the hotel is like being in Japan. There are soup restaurants and kimono shops in the hotel. There is also a whole row of cherry blossom trees. I missed the cherry blossoms in this spring. I will definitely come back next year. Hotel guests have a small door leading directly to the lavender park, and luckily we caught the tail of the lavender season.
🍕Diet: Breakfast and dinner are settled at the hotel. The dinner set was full of sincerity, and I forgot to take a lot of photos while eating and chatting. The breakfast is a buffet, very Japanese and delicious. By the way, I was pleasantly surprised that the check-in gift was a gift box of raw fruit 🎁, which is quite amazing!
The first summer trip with friends gave millions of stones, and the children can't wait to come for the second time😃

msg:Before checking in, I read a lot of reviews saying that it is not worth 2k. After I went there, I felt that the service was worthy of the price. If you are talking about 3 or 4k a night around Disney, you will definitely choose Disney Hotel. If it is less than 1k, then B&B or Chuansha Bliss Soup is also fine, but the low price is relatively more people. If you don’t want to eat dumplings, choose Million Stone. At this price, it feels necessary for a family to have a quiet soup! The staff in the hotel lobby and the soup pool are very active and enthusiastic. I checked in on Thursday afternoon, and I had two sessions from 14:00-16:00 and the next day from 10:00-12:00. It was basically the rhythm of the reserved venue, and the women's pool was clean. There is no hair, and the toiletries are good. They are all Japanese-style facilities. The children are a little bored, because there is no TV and no music in the soup pool. I feel that in the future, we can provide activities such as spa or foot bath to enrich the hotel projects. There are no gifts of wagashi this season. I received a box of small biscuits at the front desk. It is recommended to introduce some seasonal drinks. Mung bean soup and the like are not expensive. The washing and care in the room is L'Occitane, but the water is a little slow, the curtains are very good at shading, and I sleep until 10 o'clock in the night. The restaurant service is good, but because I just resumed work, there are few types of meals. The person in charge recommended the 688 package, but we still I chose a la carte, the taste is good, but the price is not high. If you don't eat Japanese food, it is recommended to walk for 5 minutes to Bistri

msg:This year is really unfriendly to Shanghai. After being banned for 3 months, every day I think about when I can go out for a trip, even if it is a short trip, but it is still very difficult🤯. This hotel was previously bought by my good neighbor Amway. After checking it, it has resumed business. Although I was hesitant about whether it would be too hot in summer, I really want to stay in a hotel far away from the city. It is considered a short trip. It is said that The hotel facilities and services and the soup pool are designed according to the Japanese concept, which is too much for those who have a Japanese travel plot, so they directly ordered a set meal package. Because the hotel is near Disney and it is hot, it is more cost-effective to think that the package can include a full meal. It was unexpectedly good to stay here. It was not hot at all to take a bath. It is right to treat winter diseases in summer.
Let’s talk about it first: Needless to say about the route to Disney by car, the hotel has a shuttle bus to Disney, which is convenient for parents and families. Public transportation is to take bus No. 1 and 2 at Disney Station and get off for 5 minutes, which is very smooth.
Environment: Beautiful. From the gate, there is a Japanese hotel's a**osphere. The surrounding greenery is good. The whole design and layout of the hotel is very reasonable. I feel that the air is much better than the urban area, and it is clean and tidy.
Room: Large space, much bigger than Japanese hotel rooms, haha, great hardware facilities, sensor lights in the shoe changing area at the door, automatic toilets with high sensitivity in toilets, Dyson hair dryers, L'Occitane washers, capsule coffee machines, electric teriyaki The kettles are all good. The bed is so comfortable and soft, I want to buy a pillow to go back.
Catering: Since I arrived at the hotel late, I booked the dinner in the package (it can also be changed to lunch). I read the pictures and talked.
Finally, the hotel's special feature is the hot spring, which is taken from the underground hot spring in Shaxi Town, Taicang♨️. It is a real hot spring. Soft water is really good for skin and hair. Girls should have more bubbles to promote blood circulation, and the soup pool is very clean👍 , The washing area will be cleaned and disinfected every 2 hours. There are 2 indoor and 2 outdoor soup pools. The indoor temperature is about 36 degrees and the outdoor temperature is 40 degrees. It’s more comfortable. It’s not like the hot, stuffy and sun-dried places in the city. Although it’s a bit hot, it has a large space and lots of green plants. The breeze blows gently from time to time, and there is a roof for sun protection.
The overall feeling is that I have traveled to Hakone, Japan to soak in hot springs in one second. It is very recommended. The hotel staff has a strong sense of service, and the feeling of being served is good. I will go again if I have the opportunity. During the epidemic, it is very comfortable to take a nap occasionally.

msg:Since March, the house has been closed, and it has been held for more than 100 days. The dine-in hotel has resumed work, and Disney has reopened the park. The excitement of Disney will be stopped for now. I found a treasure hotel in a nearby search. The first reaction was Ji Le Tang Hot Spring~ The location is perfect. The Bicester Outlet Shopping Center is across the road from the hotel. There is a small gate reserved for hotel guests next to the hotel. By swiping the room card, you can take a shortcut to Ji Gao Rabbit. Wowo Parent-Child Garden and Guangming Ecological Garden~ Maybe because the reservation was earlier, just in time for the first wave of resumption of work, the hotel sent flowers and Japanese snacks and upgraded the suite, and the room also brought a small and elegant Japanese-style courtyard~ There are also Open-air private bathtub, take a bath with frogs croaking in the starry sky at night, and then have a bottle of soft drinking water in the small refrigerator of the hotel, this feeling is simple ~ because the weather is hot and I have a baby, breakfast and lunch are solved in the restaurant that comes with the hotel ~ day The meals are very friendly for children, desserts, fried foods, pasta, and fruits are all available. Because the epidemic has just recovered, there is no way to bring the hot spring water in, and the hotel customer service has communicated in advance. I think the lockdown is at home For families who have been in for 3 months, there is nothing more to ask for such a one-stop hot spring hotel that solves tourism and leisure vacations~! (ps. Check the Disney fireworks time on the night of check-in, go to the platform on the 2nd floor of Building 6~ and Disneyland, there is only a Bluetooth speaker for music, and a mobile phone is also OK~)

msg:After being persuaded to quit by the average price of 2000/night in various places, with a good friend and a family, we finally chose the "Million Stones" in the Disney Resort - soaking in hot springs and eating Japanese food. There are no conventional children's amusement facilities. When we checked in, the 2 children were just in general interest. However, the hotel package is exceptional, and the details of room and board services are in place.

For families with parents and children, the following running accounts are for reference. The travel preparation is compact, I directly ordered a package, including a dinner package, and also sent a ticket to the rabbit nest. A Japanese-style hotel, with a small courtyard scene that can be seen everywhere, a wishing card that moves with the wind, and good clothes can make a movie. After graduating from kindergarten, I brought a school uniform and a bubble machine and took a group photo. I couldn't make an appoin**ent to Disneyland, so I took the tickets I sent and went to Rabbit Nest (closed on Monday for renovation) - the hotel's back door is directly accessible. During the day, I was completely discharged, and I went back to the hotel to change clothes in a smelly sweat. The dinner set is said to be worth more than 600, and I suspect that the price is wrong. . . It should be impossible to eat without 1000. The amazing Japanese-style steamed eggs and fire-roasted salmon, the wagyu that was divided up by the kids, is worth rushing to eat again! Waiting for the little ones to eat, I didn't come and take pictures. At the moment, I asked the restaurant if it sold a single set meal, and said that there is currently no, and it may be arranged in the future. After all, it is the high-end under the Bliss Soup, and the soup is full score. If you go late, you can directly book the venue. Change your clothes and get a box of ice milk from the vending machine. Cool! The tatami is definitely the highlight, spacious enough. I tried to ask for an extra set of sheets and quilts, saying it was tatami. It is estimated that the hotel was asked many times and delivered quickly. I don't know if the preparation is sufficient, it is recommended to call the front desk before checking in. The size does not interfere with each other at night. In the end, the two babies slept together and successfully completed the first sleepover!
*Tips: 1- The hotel has a shuttle bus to Disneytown. We missed it and it was easy to take a taxi. When entering the town, the children also need a 72-hour nucleic acid test. 2- Rabbit Nest is closed on Mondays for rest. 3- Opposite the hotel is Outlets, you can rush to buy after check-out

msg:After the epidemic was lifted, I wanted to go out and visit the hotel, but I didn't want to run too far, so I chose this place. The one-stop experience of eating, playing and soaking in hot springs is very worthwhile! First of all, the accommodation is very spacious, quiet and stylish. There are winding paths in the hotel, and the rose garden and lavender garden at the back of the hotel are also very relaxing. Besides the food, a dinner package is also very rich, both sushi and sukiyaki are worth the fare. Finally, let’s talk about this soup – I’m very satisfied. The outdoor soup is wrapped in a bamboo forest. I lie in the pool at night and look up at the bright moon in the summer night. I immediately forget the troubles of the city!

The price of a single order is a bit expensive, but the food quality is still very good. Even the breakfast menu is very similar to that of a Japanese hotel. I miss the days when I could just walk away. Fortunately, there is such a family to talk to when I can't go out.

msg:A family of three came out to relax on weekends and chose this newly opened hot spring hotel, which exceeded expectations and is very affordable. Five-star recommendation:
1. The service attitude is very good. After the lobby is done, the whole process will guide you into the room and give a detailed introduction to the room. You can drink the beverages and capsule coffee in the refrigerator, the layout is opened, and the check-in experience is good. By the way, the floor heating is super hot, similar to the experience at home in the Northeast, and it won't get cold no matter how you wear it in the room.
2. The room is Japanese-style, very large, and there are tatami mats by the window. Children like it very much. Maybe I have never seen a room of this style. I don’t even want to go out to play, I have to play in the room. The check-in ceremony is also very delicate, and the taste is also up to standard.
3. The location is golden, the hotel door is facing Yi Ou Lai, you can go there after a zebra crossing, you can go to buy and buy at any time; next to it is the Rabbit Park, the holy land for children;
4. There are two options for going to Disney: The first option is to take the bus at the entrance of the hotel to the resort on the 1st route and two stops to Disney, and the same is true when you come back. Get off the bus and enter the park near the location, and you will arrive after crossing the bridge. Therefore, it is recommended not to drive, just park the car at the hotel. It feels much more convenient than driving several times before. The disadvantage is that the balloons that children want are not bought, and public transportation is not allowed. Option 2 is the hotel's shuttle bus, there are several shifts a day, the specific time is not detailed, the time is mainly designed for people who play for a day.
5. The hot springs in the hotel are said to be soft water shipped from Jiangsu. After soaking for a long time, the skin will not wrinkle much. Men and women have separate baths, and the outdoor experience is better. When you come out, remember to get the milk by hand. (It seems that Japan likes to drink ice milk after soaking)
6. It is very Japanese from the inside to the outside, which is suitable for punching in and taking pictures, but our family does not like taking pictures and enjoys them, so we are not afraid.
7. The combination of Chinese and Japanese for breakfast realizes the freedom of cherries and salmon. The hotel at this price is above the standard. Children love curry rice. I think the noodles are quite authentic.
8. Finally, whether it is in the hotel room or the hot spring, everything is very high-end, from washing to drinking water, washing is L'Occitane.
9. Finally, let’s talk about a disadvantage. There is no play area for children, which may be the reason for the recent opening. Fortunately, the surrounding area is a good supplement.
In general, it is still highly recommended. It is a good choice for those who like to relax on weekends but are unwilling to go out to Shanghai!

msg:so happy! I booked a queen room for my wife's birthday, but when I checked in, it was upgraded to the most luxurious Japanese-style courtyard room for free! This service has nothing to say!

🚗 Transportation: The location is very good, just across the street from Bicester Shopping Village. The nearest restaurant in the hotel only serves breakfast, and lunch and dinner can be done in Bicester. There is a bus to Disney at the door of the hotel. It takes about 10 minutes to drive, which is also very convenient.

🍃Environment: The courtyard in the room is very nice, and the layout is very Japanese. There are fences around to block the view, and the privacy is very good. The soup hall has four pools, indoor and outdoor. When I went, I was alone, soaking in one by one. There is a gashapon machine at the door, and my wife drew Nezuko and water.

The breakfast is exquisite, don't miss it if you like Japanese style.

A very happy stay, thank you for the thoughtful service of the hotel. Will definitely come again next time.

msg:After reading the comments, I was a little worried. After the actual experience, the hardware of the newly opened hotel is still OK. The overall design of the Japanese style is relatively simple and comfortable, and it is very suitable to have floor heating in winter. The biggest problem is going to the hot spring through the outside, like rainy or cold weather, especially if the room is far inside, the experience is too bad. Although a corridor is designed on the second floor of the hotel, the corridor is seriously flooded in rainy days, making it difficult to clean. Finally, let’s talk about the service. The concierge and health aunt I met were very attentive, but the front desk person in charge of the check-in was blunt and you couldn’t live it, which was far from the standard of luxury hotel services. Far, the breakfast also has a gap with the standard of 268 yuan. There is still much room for improvement.

There were very few people when we went there that day. After checking in, a waiter led us to the room, and there was an electric car to sit on. The waiter helped us carry our luggage until the door of the room. The first round of drinks inside is free, Japanese tatami style, and the kids are happy.
It's very close to Bicester shopping center, we went there for a meal, and went straight to the hot spring after eating ♨️.
I thought that all the hot springs in Bliss Soup in Shanghai all have playground facilities for children, but this one only has hot springs and no facilities. Maybe I want to take pictures with the Japanese hot spring hotel. There are few people and the service is good, but it is not very convenient to have a distance from the guest room to the hot spring. Needs to be improved, overall service hygiene is satisfactory and close to Disney.

It's just that the road from the room to the soup pool is really a bit far, and it's really inconvenient to get in and out in the winter.

The two-night 2499 purchased for this Ctrip package event still thinks it is almost the same price. In fact, it is a hotel suitable for going to Disney nearby. There are no other items, no spa, and no spa baths. The bathing lobby is very small and there is nothing to play, only sitting, only vending machines. The hot spring soup pool in the hotel lobby restaurant is separated and has to be walked outside. It is still quite cold to walk outside in winter. The decoration of the room is also relatively simple, and the breakfast for two adults and one small is almost 700 😂 not worth it at all! The only restaurant only has a lunch set menu that I think is pretty good. Evening is also very high per capita! Across the road is the shopping village. Let's go to the restaurant there to eat. The Bliss Soup in the hotel is only open to in-house customers. When I went to the hotel, I encountered people who were not in the hotel and could come in and have a dip! ! Really curious how it got in! Out of curiosity, the young lady at the service desk said she was a friend of their shareholders? Will the shareholders' friends know that this is a hotel? Do you need to ask me about accommodation? Before entering the gate, you should swipe the room card and check the number of people in each room before you can enter!

First of all, as a high-end hotel, the decoration of the room is too perfunctory. There is a TV on one side of the white wall, and two beds on the opposite side. The most exquisite is the toilet, and the toilet is the most advanced. There are toilets, I don't understand
Guest room lobby The hot springs are not in one building, so it is a bit troublesome to walk around in cold weather.
The hot spring hall is quite complete, and the aunt is very enthusiastic. One star is given to the aunt.
The soup is just a few pools. There are no steaming or entertainment items like those in the ordinary Bliss soup. It is very simple.
The buffet breakfast is mainly Japanese, there are not many choices, but the taste is ok.
The overall feeling is very general, I don't know where my two thousand ocean flowers have gone

Generally speaking, the price of an ordinary room is more than a thousand per night, and it is just across the road from Bicester Village. It is only two stops away from Disneyland (and the Disney shuttle station is right in front of the hotel)

msg:The overall environment is good. Even if the room is full on New Year's Day, there are not many people in sight, and there are not many people in the hot spring area. It feels like a Japanese street and has a great a**osphere. The hotel is new, so the hygiene is also very good, but some details need to be improved in person:
1. As a hotel, there isn't even a luggage rack in the room, which is too unreasonable.
2. In the whole room, except for the toilet roll paper, no paper towels can be found. I don't know if the cleaning staff forgot to release it or didn't provide it.
3. The temperature of the female soup is suitable and the soaking is quite comfortable. The temperature of the male soup is a bit too high (indoor 40 degrees and outdoor 42 degrees), my husband and son are a bit unbearable, which affects the experience.
4. The bathing and washing area does not provide basic skin care products such as toners and lotions. Since it is advertised as a high-end hot spring hotel and benchmarked against Japan, don't save this money.

ps: You can clearly see the Disney fireworks in the outdoor bathing area of the female bath. The New Year's special fireworks on New Year's Day are so beautiful. While enjoying the hot spring while enjoying the refreshing fireworks, of course, there is no such experience in the male bath.

msg:The hotel is still in trial operation, you can see his intentions. The most commendable is the quality of the soft water soup spring, which is very good for the skin, indeed as advertised. The operation of the Kekileyu Hot Spring Museum is obviously very careful. It provides a clean and hygienic bathrobe and a free glass of milk, and the rest area is slightly smaller. The attitude of the front desk was good. When the customers were overwhelmed and it was too late to clean up the rooms, the vacant rooms were adjusted and the check-out was delayed according to the delay time. However, it is still recommended to prepare for the emergency filing of high-traffic holidays, including the rooms and breakfast supply, which are slightly flustered. The location is very good, opposite the Bicester shopping area, and it is also very fast to reach the Disney town through the Moslian Garden behind.

If you can’t catch the hotel’s shuttle bus to Disney, there is a bus stop opposite the hotel, which is just a few steps away. The hotel’s service staff are also very enthusiastic, because we have ordered room service several times during the New Year, and they came very promptly. If Disney stays at the hotel later, I will definitely choose this one again.

msg:"Superb Japanese hotel in Shanghai ♨️♨️"
I chose to stay in Shanghai because of the epidemic and my friends’ New Year’s Eve
I found a hotel near Disney
Staying in is a surprise. Traveling through Japan🇯🇵
After check-in, a staff member will drive us to the hotel and introduce the park facilities along the way.
Originally, there was no set breakfast, but I gave us two Japanese breakfasts very intimately.
Lots of food choices and great taste
I have to say that Japanese breakfast is really a staple food and a staple food. You don’t have to eat it after lunch.
Back to the experience of staying in the room is very warm and clean, there is a tatami mat, staying will also give wagashi
The matching care is L'Occitane
The hot springs in the hotel use spring water. I heard that it contains skin care oil. After soaking, I feel slippery.
And because the soup pool is only open to guests, it’s very private and there are few people.
There is also a *****tore and a kimono shop in the hotel park. One-stop experience🉑️

🚗 Transportation: just across from Bicester Village. If you go to Disney, you can get there in ten minutes by taxi
🍃Environment: It’s a newly opened hotel, so the sanitation is great
🔔Service: I think the service experience is very good. As long as I meet the staff in the park, I will greet the guests
If you can't leave the country because of the epidemic, it is recommended to come here to experience Japanese style ♨️

msg:Knowing that Shanghai has opened a high-end hotel for Bliss Soup, I have always wanted to experience it. I personally like the light and luxurious decoration style of the hotel, because there are few people on the peak, the bathing experience is also very good, and the breakfast is also considered rich.
I thought the hotel would be the same as other Bliss Soups, in addition to bathing there will be some entertainment facilities, but the actual hot springs are two or three indoor and open-air bathing pools, which is quite boring.
And from the guest room to the hot springs, you have to go through the outdoors. In such a cold day, you can wear three floors inside and three outside. When you go to the hot springs to soak in the hot springs, it is really funny to wear and take off your clothes.
I saw some guests directly wearing the big cotton robe provided by the hotel to bathe outside the bathrobe, but I asked the front desk and was told what package these guests bought! Are you wondering if all the guests come to stay in your hotel? Shouldn't such a robe have two pieces in the room for all guests to use? There is no need to treat it differently!

Summary of feelings: The service is good, but not detailed. The environment is nice, but not amazing. The main hot spring is a bit disappointing. Personally, it is not worth the price.


1. Check-in at the front desk at 2:30, you still need to wait a moment to confirm that the room cleaning is completed.
2. Building 6 is far away and there is a shuttle bus to pick you up. Pick up and drop off every time (the guy is very cute)
3. The scenery is not good after checking in, and there are many electronic devices in the house. Call the staff to come over and explain how to use it (personally, I feel that if you take the initiative to accompany and explain, the experience will be much better)
4. The toiletries are different from those sold online, so please replace them.
5. Called to inquire about the Chris**as fruit giveaway (saw it online), but no one mentioned it before.
6. The hot spring (women's hot spring) has an indoor and outdoor pool, and the indoor is a natural hot spring; the venue is much smaller than expected, and there are no other items (such as bathing, leisure space, food, movies, etc.). It comes out in about an hour. (Aunt Tang is very enthusiastic and cute)
7. Breakfast is a buffet of Japanese food. There are not many varieties. I arrived at 9 o'clock. Some are out of stock and the replenishment is not timely.

msg:After returning to Shanghai, I haven't returned to Japan for almost two years due to the epidemic. Seeing this hot spring hotel, I chose to come and experience it on weekdays. Because it is a trial operation, I will understand the imperfections of some details, but I still hope to improve:
1) The reservation is made through Ctrip, and the remarks stated that an extra bed is required. When I arrived, I found that the information was not updated. After talking about it, the front desk didn’t show up for three hours. I urged it twice to come.
2) The new decoration has a smell, which is covered by fragrance. In fact, you need to open more windows for ventilation, especially when the trial operation rooms are not full
3) The movement guidance between each venue is not as good as that of Japanese hotels, and it is not clear enough
4) As a hot spring hotel, it is impossible to soak in the hot spring in the morning, which is unimaginable in Japan. The so-called follow the locals, I understand that is not the case
5) The restaurant has only one Japanese food, and the nearby convenience store is far away. The price of the Japanese food store is slightly higher than that of the urban area, so the choices are too limited.
6) For the use time of various facilities, the pre-explanation of the activity time is insufficient

Generally speaking, the environment is beautiful and the venue is wide. But staff training needs to be strengthened. When checking in at the front desk, I didn't feel the extraordinary feeling, which was similar to ordinary business hotels, and didn't give me an amazing feeling.

The passenger flow is very few and the service is very attentive. The afternoon bathing is basically a one-person private room. I went on 11/22. At four or five o’clock in the afternoon, there were two or three service staff aunts who were very enthusiastic. One aunt with bangs actually blown my hair. This is definitely not within the scope of the service, but I was really flattered. My boyfriend said that he was a man. The same is true for the uncle of Tang. We are all pleasantly surprised by the service. Thank you very much. We hope that Bliss Tang will give them some rewards. It will inevitably attract more customers, and we are willing to pay for the soup and considerate service.

Because the soup pool is only open to our hotel guests, the experience of privacy and hygiene is very good. Going to soak at night, there is only the sound of running water, which is very suitable to let yourself go and have a good rest. The outdoor pool has a roof. If it is higher, you can see more sky, or if there is a pool without a roof, it feels more open.
Upon check-in, a box of exquisite pastries gave us a little surprise. At the Yakushima restaurant in the hotel, dinner can only be ordered a la carte without a set meal. The a la carte dishes are exquisite but the price is a bit hot.
Apart from bathing in the hotel, there are few other entertainment facilities.

The hotel facilities are very new, and the sanitary environment is comparable to Japanese hotel standards. Two elderly people are unanimously praised. We booked two Japanese-style elegant twin rooms. The rooms are Japanese-style. The toiletries are all from L’Occitane. The Japanese wagashi pastry gift box, there are dehumidifiers and air purifiers in the room, but the noise is a bit louder. Our order includes breakfast and hot spring tickets for the next day. As the National Day holiday has not yet arrived, there are very few hotel guests. We took two baths after check-in, each of which was reserved. The bath is divided into indoor and outdoor. There are four pools in total. The hot spring feels good. Although it is not as good as the experience in Japan, it is still acceptable. Used facial masks and skin care products. There is also a kimono rental shop in the hotel area. With the room card, you can get a discount of 100 yuan, but each room is limited to one person. The staff service is good, and the way of wearing yukata and kimono is also very professional. Hotel guests are late the next morning. It was returned to the front desk of the hotel, so we also wore kimonos when we went out to the Bicester shopping village opposite to have dinner. The breakfast on the second day is still a private room. The entire restaurant is served by our family, and the breakfast waiters are enthusiastic around us. At first, the online reviews thought it was a one-person set meal, and I was afraid that the men would not have enough to eat. The result was a small buffet order, but there were not as many varieties as other five-star hotels, but it was enough to eat. Cooked udon The noodles have a strong taste and delicious. The small pastries are relatively average. There are a few cute but not good tastes. I hope they can be improved in the future. The hotel also has a free bus to Disneyland, which can be reached in about ten minutes. In short, although the price is slightly more expensive, but overall it is worth experiencing, and I will experience it again if I have the opportunity.

I stayed at Million Stone again after a lapse of February, and I am very pleased that it has been carefully upgrading various services and facilities.
Let me talk about the special choice for staying on the last day of the Mid-Autumn Festival. In order to experience the 24-hour efficient and ideal holiday combination of "Bicester Shopping Village + Disney Mid-Autumn Fireworks + Open-air Baths and Moon Viewing", I spent a day of shopping and fun outside. The hotel slid into the pool under the sky of Haoyue. After we were exhausted, we could resurrect with full blood and return to the city to upgrade and fight monsters. :)

How to play: Bicester + Disney + Million Stone
The location of the hotel is unique, and the service center of Bicester Village is just across the road from the gate. Guests with VIP cards can enjoy free SF shopping trophies and hands-free shopping. There is also a shuttle bus available for hotel guests to Disneyland (at 8 am, 8 pm and around 9:30 after the fireworks, we boarded at the Donald Duck parking lot at the exit of the park). The park is a physical activity, and there is no living nearby. Transportation and transportation are too physically challenging.

Let’s talk about the several enhancements of this stay to experience Million Stones:
1. Activities: The Mid-Autumn Festival holiday hotel has very rich activities, there are performances and garden party activities, the hotel is also decorated with solar moon rabbit lights, the festive atmosphere is very interesting.
2. Bathing: Japanese Yukata can be worn in the hotel area. The addition of automatic Japanese food vending machines and gashapon machines also allows guests to replenish energy at any time and relieve gluttons. The soup pool also adds a Mid-Autumn Osmanthus limited soup.
3. Guest room: The courtyard twin room is still clean and comfortable. The wagashi is also a special Mid-autumn festival. The music, temperature and moderation at the entrance are all set just right. We checked in at 12 and the toothbrush was delivered quickly.
4. Public area: The *****tore has opened. Various facial masks and small Japanese care items can be purchased with the bathing experience. You can write a wishing wooden sign next to it.

It is really pleasant to have a new hotel that improves every time, and I look forward to seeing better Million Stones next time you come back!

msg:I wanted to bring my family to experience it, so I first stepped on it. If it's thunder, don't step on the family 😅. The overall is more than expected, so let's comment.
Check-in: I was a bit late than I made the appoin**ent. I arrived at the front desk more than 18 o'clock. The waiter was very enthusiastic and the efficiency of checkin was quite high. Afterwards, the waiter led the room and passed the Japanese-style yard along the way. The overall a**osphere was good. The lights were turned on at night. Special feeling.
Room: The rooms here are like small villas, divided into the first floor and the second floor. The room I live in is on the second floor. There are not many rooms, so I feel very private. The room is very spacious, and the decoration is Japanese-style solid wood simple style. You can still smell the unique smell of wood in the room, probably because it is a relatively new relationship. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the toiletries are relatively complete. The water pressure in the bathroom is quite sufficient, and the shower is quite comfortable. There was a small episode. At first, the hair dryer didn't need to call the front desk and quickly sent one for me, and gave me some guidance, and the response was very fast.
In addition, I want to especially praise this bedding. I have lived in a more comfortable bedding. The mattress is very good. It is the softness and hardness that I like.
Dinner: There is a shopping village opposite Bicester. I want to go shopping and have dinner inside. This is also a highlight. You can go shopping after a distance of the road, praise, praise, but it closes a bit early , This is not a lot of shopping to go again next time.
Hot spring: After dinner, it is natural to take a hot spring. The equipment is very new, so I won't say much. The most important thing is that it is said that the ones used here are all real! temperature! spring! water! It’s really comfortable, but I can only stay for 10 minutes in this weather, but it’s enough to relax ☺️The pool is divided into large pools and small pools, indoor, outdoor, and outdoor are also divided into 2 pools, open-air, and a wall separated from the men’s pool. , If a family comes to the meeting, they can probably hear each other chatting. In addition, there is ice milk to drink after soaking in the hot spring. This is very Japanese. I especially praise this milk. Although the packaging is not as flavorful as the Japanese glass bottle, the taste is really dull and very delicious.
Breakfast: Japanese-style set meal, quite satisfactory, the part of the buffet is milk porridge or something, the choice is a little bit small. The fried fish served for breakfast is a bit chai, and the miso soup is quite authentic. In addition, the air-conditioning in the lobby of the restaurant is too full. I feel a little bit cold after having breakfast. I hope it can be improved!
Overall it exceeds my expectations and will bring family members here once

The exquisite plant landscaping, the street lights in the shape of a small house, the red brick and blue tiles, you can shoot a blockbuster easily, and the room is also presented with handmade wagashi, and the soft drinks in the minibar on the first day are free~~~ Great!

The bedding and service are all OK, in general, it is still a recommended hotel!

msg:The decoration is attentive, the hardware is good, the service attitude is good, but the details are too poor
Weekend price is 2500, renting clothes is 399, and 88. Hotel room card is 100 cheaper...
The price of a meal is more expensive than the Bund. The waiting time is 40 minutes. An ice cream ball is 100 yuan. The fried rice 398 has a deep memory...
The sushi rice ball may be as small as 30 rice (half thumb) for fear that you will be full
Eating one or two thousand is the same as not eating
This price is all Shanghai omakase eat it casually, how can this suburban Japanese food store be ashamed to say that it’s just a special slaughter in store punches.
The hotel has nothing to play except the small hot spring pool... (separate for men and women) It is better to go to the baths
I don’t know how those reviews who have soaked in Japanese hot springs say that the hot spring water is the same as in Japan! ! The texture is completely different.
The most important thing is that there is no room service throughout the day! ! I didn’t have enough for dinner, I could only get hungry in the middle of the night!
The hotel care is L’Occitane verbena... But people who have used more than a dozen bottles of verbena in previous years said that the smell is a bit strange... Maybe it's a version update?
So... the hotel is new and the hardware is good, but it won’t be used twice. The maximum value is 1k and can’t be more.
Another point is that I was still sleeping at 12 at noon, and an aunt opened the door to clean up and said that the front desk told me that this room has been checked out... This is a hotel taboo...
It's a boutique hotel at best, it's definitely not a professional hotel...
Now at noon, I’m sitting in the hotel restaurant and writing this sentence. I entered at two o’clock and waited for 20 minutes. I haven’t served food yet... The restaurant is very few and few people. I don’t understand why I have to wait for 40 minutes for dinner in the evening and half an hour at noon! ! It’s really because it’s a hot day that you don’t want to go out, or who would eat here! ! !

msg:The courtyard room we stayed in was clean and the front desk service was very good. The room we chose was very satisfied. I felt that the price was a bit high before I went. The kimono shop opposite the front desk was very beautiful and the clothes were very beautiful. Warm and professional, you can rent for 24 hours. The formal dress we chose is almost 700 sets. There is also a cheap breakfast. Although it is a set meal, there are also various fruit teas, milk drinks and soups that can be taken by yourself. There is still a lot of food. There were three or four aunts standing in the dressing room. I changed my clothes. They were watching and chatting. It was really embarrassing. I felt that there was no one in the bath and there was no need for so many aunts. Some of the aunts had an attitude. When I go to the cell phone, I can’t use my cell phone in the locker room. I didn’t use it. One aunt told the other that I was going to take a secret photo. I heard that I said I put it in the closet. People feel uncomfortable

msg:One: I went out in the afternoon and went back to the hotel more than nine o'clock in the evening. I opened the door in shock and didn't turn down the bed. The room was messy. Ask the staff who came to deliver the toothbrushes. Do you not have this service? What she said was turning down.
Two: The hotel has no entertainment facilities. The children have no place to play, but they are not satisfied to buy an ice cream.
Three: The staff of the shuttle bus will not be flexible. Under the big sun, we are required to wait for another baggage to go to the lobby to carry three or four times. We decisively get off the bus and walk to the lobby by ourselves.
Of course the location of the hotel is good, there is a shopping village on the opposite side. It takes ten minutes to get to Disney.

msg:Came with high expectations, left with disappointment.
To be frank, this hotel is terrible!! Regardless of expectations, it is very reasonable to say that it cannot be worse at this price.

First, check in.
We were a group of two families with children. We arrived at the hotel at 1:30 pm. When we checked in, they said that the room had not been cleaned yet and we had to wait for 30 minutes. OK! I have no objection to the two o'clock agreed. (By the way, we usually don't argue with the hotel that the legal requirement for hotels is 24 hours). The key is that the front desk told the auntie to clean. Oh my God. Clean two rooms in 30 minutes. I also confirmed with the front desk, "Can two rooms be cleaned in 30 minutes?" The front desk answered with certainty, "Yes." At that time, I began to worry about the hygiene of the room. Was the quilt changed? Was the cup disinfected or washed? After 30 minutes, we were told to upgrade to a twin room with garden view. We booked a Japanese elegant king-size bed room. Finally, when we got home, we found that there was no upgrade at all, but our king-size bed room was changed to a twin-size bed room. It was clear that we were being treated. The front desk didn't know what room upgrade meant. Then the waiting time was 30 minutes. The reception time was almost 30 minutes. It was very chaotic. There was only one machine to take pictures, and there was no order, it was just a mess!

Finally, I checked into the room!
After checking in, the Japanese style gave people the feeling that it should be very clean. There were no children's slippers in the room, the hotel didn't have them, and we didn't bring them, so I planned to let my daughter go barefoot, but the floor was not clean, there was a lot of dust, hair, and rolling dust, and it was impossible to go barefoot. We asked the aunt to wipe it again, but the speakers were covered with dust. It was frustrating. Think about the two rooms that could be checked in half an hour before... (Forget it, don't talk about things you didn't see). Then a small cockroach was found in my friend's room 🪳, and a centipede (like a small centipede) was found at night, the sky was vast and the wilderness was vast! My God! !
The layout of the large room was ordinary, with dry and wet separation, and the design sense was reflected in the small places. From the outside, it looked like a planted flower that was not very good-looking.
The path of the hotel felt good. There were not many people. The hotel was very small.

Hot spring pool
!! Another pitfall!! The hotel is supposed to be a small and exquisite hot spring pool. But there are only three pools. Then there is a toilet and a dressing area in the bathing area. What's that? We spent half an hour. Don't even think about wearing a Japanese yukata (like a kimono👘), just an ordinary servant-like yukata (a style), and the nice ones cost money. Three or four hundred yuan to rent a day. It's really unnecessary. My husband and his friend came out in ten minutes. It's really boring.

Parent-child facilities
No! Yes, no. Just no!

Dining
Another pitfall!! A huge pitfall!!
Where is the promised Mi San? ! What the hell! If you give 1 point out of 10, it's for the baby chair. Really, really, an ordinary izakaya. The tone is consistent with the hotel. I want to spend money to experience the good and high-end, but I spent money and found that the experience was that the hotel treated me like a **, and it would be bad if I didn't try the restaurant. It's not bad, but I still say, it's unnecessary, what the hell do you call yourself Mi San!
Do you think the hotel breakfast looks very exquisite in the pictures? This is the most frustrating part! There are not many people in the hotel, and they look too busy. There is no children's breakfast in the six-square set meal. The self-service includes: white porridge, rice, udon noodles, kimchi, pickles, milk, and maybe some drinks are missing, that's it. I was shocked when the six-square set was placed in front of me. It felt like Motel 168 was selling Amman at the price. Six-square grid: a steamed egg, sausage with mashed potato cake, a piece of fish (very old), a salad, two potato cubes with konjac knots and a piece of chicken, a small pickle (see Figure 5), this six-square grid was prepared for a long time... and it was still not delicious, alas 😮‍💨...

The only good thing is that the cleaning lady in the room was very active in delivering water, and it was no problem to drink voss water until you were full~ There are so many hotels in Shanghai, and this is the first one with such a bad price. How does it want to survive? It's very strange~ Wouldn't it be nice to stay in one of the many good hotels such as Puli, Anadi, Park Hyatt, Yongshe, etc. If you want to stay in Disney, just go to the official hotel. I fell into this pit for you!

msg:I saw the introduction of the hotel on a certain public account, and came to **** before the start of school. Check-in is fast, the hotel opened soon, so the appearance and facilities are very new. The indoor public spaces and rooms are empty and working, so there is no smell. Duplex room electric curtains, washlets, double basins, smart speakers including Hermes accessories are all high-end standard equipment.
On weekends and weekends, there are 4 pools for male and female baths, 2 indoors and 2 outdoors, but they are connected, in fact, one indoor and outdoor. The soup is said to be a real hot spring shipped from other places. Anyway, I didn't see the specific introduction in the store. Let me believe that the products are genuine at a reasonable price. Since they are only open to hotel guests, there are not many people in general and the experience is good. The bathroom outside the soup pool is also kept very clean, and the service staff have been wiping and tidying up. Cold milk and facial mask will be given when you soak and rest. The next day I also tried the bathtub in the balcony, which was quite comfortable, but only suitable for single people😝
In terms of service, it should be attentive, and the staff's response speed is also very fast. I ordered spare parts and mineral water, and they were delivered quickly, which exceeded my expectations. I also gave wagashi and many small gifts when I checked in. In addition, smart speakers are also extra points. You can order songs by yourself, listen to your favorite music, drink tea, bubble soup, and feel comfortable 😆
Next is the slot. The duplex room I live in can access the balcony from the living room and bathroom, but the doors on both sides cannot be locked. The friends who went there are also duplex rooms. Although the sliding door on the balcony can be locked, but the bolt falls after shaking it a few times. This safety is worrying. This decoration detail is completely unworthy of the hotel's own luxury positioning and this price.
The second is breakfast. It is understandable that the hot spring hotel provides a fixed meal breakfast, but the simple style and the few varieties are really not worth the price of the hotel alone. The breakfast packages offered at hot spring hotels less than 2000 at Lake Kawaguchi are all three-course 😂
In addition, the water provided in the hotel room is 500ml VOSS, and the next delivery is a 330ml small bottle. Although it is a trivial matter, the experience is reduced a bit 😝 but compared to Chicken and Mario 2000 easily The hotel is equipped with 1 yuan a bottle of ice dew, this is already considered kind.
Then there is staying with a friend, the same price, the same room type, but the duplex room the friend stayed in was obviously 10-15% smaller than mine, which was confusing. If there is no contrast, it may not matter. With contrast, there will be a pimple in my heart🙄
In general, the hotel is still worth recommending. Come to warm up during winter vacation. By the way, the entrance of the hotel is right at the entrance of Bristol Shopping Village, which is all kinds of convenience.

There is a feeling of not going abroad. Thank you Falls. I believe there is such a good leader to bring it out. With such an excellent team, I will share these wonderful staying experiences with more friends. Thank you for your hard work.

Drink a small wine in the evening and soak in a hot spring to completely relax. When I went there coincided with heavy rain, soaking in the hot springs in the rain gave me a unique view. The minibar has beer and Paris water for free, as well as capsule coffee. Toiletries of Hermes are one level higher than ordinary rooms. The disadvantage is that there are no children's slippers and toothbrushes, and the bathroom sink lacks a child's step stool. If you mind hot springs in public, it is recommended that you must set up a supreme room type.

The hot spring water is relatively clean and trial operation. Free bathing room for hotel guests. The hair dryer in the room is Dyson toiletries. With pillows, it is recommended that the room can be installed with a fresh air system. If the water in the rain room is not smooth, it will spread to the toilet next to it. The hotel should pay attention to it! The breakfast is a Japanese-style set, which is relatively simple, but the meal is slow and the fish is not fresh. Be careful! The staff basically have a sense of service and are more enthusiastic and polite. They will take the initiative to ask about customer needs. Special thanks to Falls at the front desk and a little brother in the shuttle bus (forgot to read the name (•̀ᴗ•́)و ̑̑) The service is very intimate. Because I am also in the same industry, I pay more attention to small details. The overall experience of staying in is still very good. I will often choose this hotel in the future!

Then the eel rice said it was not available at night! But those who take the meal coupons at the next table can have it? Wonderful!

The hot springs are clean and well managed. It is still a good choice when you can’t go out of Shanghai. It’s the Chinese Valentine’s Day. I gave a lot of small gifts. It’s very considerate. The toiletries are from L’Occitane. Dyson hair dryers are used in the hot springs. The rooms are not Dyson’s. There are few key people, but the soundproofing effect of the room is not good. Hearing the sound of the next door, the sound of the water pipe on the top of the room at midnight is too noisy. We can only change the room in the middle of the night. The hotel service staff is very nice, but I feel that the operation is not familiar yet. As soon as I enter the restaurant, I say an extra breakfast. After the meal Forgot...but overall it's good, easy to park

The experience of staying in is very good, full of Japanese style, architectural style, environmental facilities, service level are very satisfied. Especially in the hot springs, which are only open to hotel guests, there are almost no people, so you can almost enjoy the feeling of private bathing. Breakfast is a daily set meal, with reasonable collocation and abundant business. Opposite the hotel is Bicester Shopping Village, which is very convenient for shopping. It is also very convenient to drive a few minutes away from Disney Town. In short, it is a treasure hotel, and I will come when I am free in the future.

msg:I often go to Biyun’s Bliss Soup, natural hot spring water, who doesn’t love it ❤️
Recently I heard that the first hot spring hotel has been opened in the Disney Resort. Come and experience it before becoming a hard-to-find Internet celebrity hotel.
👭 Million Stone Hot Spring Street is a high-end brand of Bliss Soup, a comprehensive hot spring resort town integrating hotel accommodation, leisure and entertainment, dining and shopping. The natural hot spring water "Silver Soup" is transported from the ancient town of Shaxi in Taicang at any cost. After soaking, the skin will not be dry and the hair will not be frizzy~
👘There is also a kimono experience shop in the small town, which matches the overall Japanese architectural style. It is very good for filming, as if you are in Japan.
🍡As soon as I entered the room after checking in, I found the beautifully packaged Japanese wagashi on the table with edible gold leaf on it, which is so cute
🍼Hotel guests can experience the hot spring museum for free. The museum provides free ice milk to replenish moisture at any time. After soaking, skin care products and facial masks are also given. It is too intimate! !

🚗 Transportation:
We came by car and parking is free. Because the hotel is in the Disney business district, the hotel provides a free shuttle to and from Disney, which is about an 8-minute drive from Disney (reservation at the concierge one day in advance is required)
🧹Hygiene:
Newly opened hotel, there are not many people, the soup pool is also very clean
🍃Environment:
Quiet in the noisy, there are outlets and lavender park next to it, you can stroll around if you have time
🔔Service:
The coffee machine in the room got stuck, call the front desk to change it immediately, and the service was prompt and five-star praise

All the items in the room were brand new, and I felt very good. 👍The toiletries are from L’Occitane, but it is recommended to bring your own toothbrush and comb, otherwise you have to ask the front desk to get it. Tatami is very convenient, you can put two mattresses together, and you don’t worry about children rolling off. Although there are not many soup pools, they are better. If there are few people, I hope that the hotel will control the flow of people in the bath in the future, otherwise it will feel crowded. The children have soaked three times in two days and will go next time, but I hope that the hotel will have more other entertainment activities, although Yioulai is just around the corner. Go, but I hope to stay in a hotel and open one more restaurant. At least there is a bar or a cafe, so that three or five friends can chat and talk about life😄! In short, I will come again, at least once in winter. In short, I hope that there will be no more people, no more people, no more people...

msg:The weather was cold and I came here to soak in the hot springs with my family. I originally thought that a hotel in this price range should be at a five-star level, but the overall result was very disappointing. First of all, the wash basin in one of the arranged rooms leaked, so I asked to change rooms, but the arranged room was closer to my family, which felt very bad. Secondly, the overall training of the hotel service staff is very poor, and their conversational skills are not friendly. For example, I asked to change rooms due to water leakage, and someone came over to check the room. I asked for a late checkout (half an hour) to pack my things at noon, but I refused. Very abrupt and unfriendly. In addition, the breakfast is very not delicious, a bit Japanese-style and not Japanese-style. The people in the restaurant are also very unprofessional. The service staff who do not wear masks are walking around in the restaurant and wiping them everywhere. It is a bit like looking for trouble. It is not hygienic and makes others uncomfortable while picking up their meals. This level of training is not even as good as an express hotel. Finally, the design of the hotel is unreasonable. On rainy days, the first floor of each building is separated. When checking out, you have to take your suitcase out to get wet in the rain before reaching the front desk. The hotel did not proactively provide services to solve the problem. Generally speaking, there is no sincerity in the service of this hotel. The service is forced and sloppy in a formal way. Very not worth coming back.
The only thing is that one of the aunties in Ji Le Tang is more responsible and dedicated, and looks like a high-end hotel. However, this aunt is the only one who can make people feel comfortable when staying in this hotel.

Reminder⏰ Don’t book this hotel on Ctrip. For some reason, the price I booked on Ctrip is nearly 500 more expensive than the single room price on the hotel check-in confirmation. Very unreasonable.

I have been in Japan for 13 years, and for the first time in Shanghai, I felt so close to a Japanese hot spring hotel. Outstanding details, high-quality service, beautiful environment, and the most invincible feature is that there is no one in the minority. Let's pull the ****s before becoming an internet celebrity.

The front desk asked the guest room staff to check it out. Haha! The sheets are stiff and the indoor hot spring smells like disinfectant. This is the first time I go there and it is also the last time I go there.

msg:Take the children to Disney, saw this new hotel, gave up the Disneyland Hotel, booked for three nights. Talk about the real stay experience
1. Only four bottles of 300ml mineral water are provided every day, and the extra needs to be purchased by the residents themselves at 10 yuan per bottle. Suggestion: Because the shopping village of the hotel closes early, Disney comes back too late, and if you want to drink water, you need to order takeaway. It is recommended that the hotel open a convenience store on its own so that guests can buy drinking water. In the hot summer, more water is still needed
2. The water in the bathroom of the room is seriously blocked (see the picture) if you don’t control the amount of water each time you take a bath, you will definitely have to flood Jinshan
3. The hair dryer in the room is not Dyson, it is a brand of Hotellink specializing in hotel supplies. The accessories are not Hermès, and there is no gift box that every guest will give away after check-in as mentioned in the previous reviews. The time after reading the previous reviews is roughly the same as mine. Some room types are the same as the ones I booked, and the hotel is here. It only opened in mid-July. Therefore, if the students who stay in the hotel later have expectations for a 3K hotel, they can confirm the room facilities with the hotel before booking.
4. Talk about hotel hygiene. The coffee machine is a capsule coffee machine of Nestlé, but the coffee machine should be a device that is neglected when cleaning the room. There are a lot of floats and water stains on it.
5. It may be related to the season in Shanghai. Small winged bugs are found in the house every day. You must check before going to bed at night, otherwise there will be small pets sleeping together.
6. The pillow should be down, but it tastes great. Students who mind can bring their own pillows.
7. If the previous comment says that there is a hotel with a Disney shuttle bus, we asked about it twice during the three days we stayed and asked about it if it rained on two days. The driver did not come to work on the first day, and the hotel said on the second day that we need to take the bus to Disneyland. More convenient, the facts prove that the bus is really convenient.
Of course the hotel still has a nice place
1. The hotel's hot springs are still good, which can be regarded as a major selling point and feature of the hotel. Now during the trial business period, hotel guests can enjoy free hot springs. After the official opening, the price will be 499 per person.
2. The hotel’s breakfast is set for 268 persons, and the breakfast is exquisite and exquisite.
3. The service attitude of the hotel staff is good, they are very polite
4. The location of the hotel is not far from Disney, and it can be reached by bus at three stops at the door.
The above are all the reviews for the three nights stay, I hope to help the students who are going to make reservations later.

msg:In all fairness, the sanitation and environment of the hotel are still very good. After all, the hotel is very new and very quiet. Friends who like quiet can choose to stay!
Now talk about the slot:
1. The breakfast in the hotel is very, very poor. We who love Japanese food on weekdays gave up decisively after taking a bite. The breakfast in a five-star hotel is a set meal, which means that you have no right to choose. Drinks can only be selected from finished orange juice and milk. The food is good or bad. Regarding the breakfast, I, like the person in charge of the hotel, expressed their opinions and said that they would not eat the breakfast they provided again. The person in charge also said that the meal fee can be refunded. It has been a week since the matter has not been properly handled. Moreover, the algorithm and standard of the price when you buy breakfast and when you cancel breakfast are different.
2. The service is very business. When I checked in at the hotel, I asked the front desk how to take the car to Disney, and I confirmed it three times and told me that it was in the opposite direction. The next day I took the car in the opposite direction.
3. The hotel's supporting equipment only knows that there is a 4-pool hot spring and a Japanese restaurant that is not managed by the hotel. Checking in the hotel does not even have instructions for the use of the facilities, you need to call one by one to ask if there are instructions for use at the front desk. The first sentence at the front desk says that we are a hotel, and we need to know what we can let colleagues show you around. Please! I need to rest when you have time!
4. The attitude of the hotel staff is very good, but if you don't take the initiative to greet you, you don't know who is the employee and who is the guest. There is no uniform dress code. Most of them wear their own casual clothes. I don't know if they are all leaders or what. The person in charge said that they have a badge that can be identified, so I will look at the badge for service.
5. I checked out on July 23rd, today the 29th. It's been 6 days. Last night, I found that the 2,000 yuan deposit I paid when I checked in at the hotel had not been refunded, so I contacted the hotel, and they answered that it was an operating error, that is, I forgot. That is, if I can’t remember the 2000 yuan, I won’t be refunded? !
Five-star hotels do not have five-star services and supporting facilities. This is very disappointing to me. I thought it would be helpful for the hotel to improve the hotel by giving advice to the hotel. However, I still see this series of operations in the follow-up process. too naive. In the eyes of the hotel, I may be a picky customer, and I will not be the target customer for repurchase. This is all understandable. At this time of today, I made this comment firmly in the hope that the hotel would really be aware of its own problems, and I would not recommend it to friends around me. It can be seen that the hotel has no sincerity to solve the problem!

希望明年聖誕能低價訂到我的寶藏酒店

msg:純日式的酒店，日式小院很雅緻。坐落在比斯特購物中心旁邊，餐飲購物非常便利。門口的1號線直通迪士尼樂園，比酒店接駁車還便利。

温泉是公共湯池，男女分開，一早開到晚上11:00，有室內和室外兩種，每次泡湯酒店免費提供光明牛奶。

我們帶4歲娃去迪士尼，一早9:00入園，玩一上午到1點看完花車巡演後回酒店，娃睡午覺，大人輪流去泡湯放乏，4點起床去隔壁比斯特吃晚飯，6點入園繼續刷夜場到9:30散場。回酒店再泡一遍温泉，然後美美入睡。

但是個人感覺不值1700一晚：1. 地暖太熱了，燥熱，沒有加濕器，體感非常不舒服，而且温度調低沒什麼用，最後是空調開到最低，整晚開着窗户才覺得舒適；2. 台盆太高，台盆前就是毛巾桿，這個設計太奇葩，洗漱非常不舒服（女生要卸粧用洗面奶的應該懂）；3. 早餐可吃的太少，這個價位的酒店可以説太差了；4. 温泉水説是從太倉運過來的，但是泡完並沒有感覺輕鬆解壓，就是個熱水，我們之前在台灣北投泡完温泉（有硫磺味）整個人很輕鬆舒適，肌肉緊張和僵硬都沒了，所以對此處的温泉水存疑

msg:非常非常好，誰來迪士尼我都會推薦這家。

設施：先説位置，距離迪士尼公交車兩三站，門口就是站台，回來也是兩三站。打車和私家車都沒有公交車離得近，所以這反而是優勢。對面就是類似奧萊的商場，提前半天到還能逛逛街，美美美。

設施：温泉應該是一大特色，暑假逛迪士尼都是兩萬起步。之前或者之後能泡個温泉簡直美哉，而且温泉環境很好，洗護用品也很用心。

服務：服務可圈可點，從擺渡車接送客到睡前綠豆湯，隨叫隨到有求必應，每個人見了客人都會打招呼，還會開夜床，一千塊的房子，超五星服務。

衞生：衞生更是沒的説，一點灰塵和毛毛看不出來。

早餐:也是日式的感覺，餐廳不大所以種類不多，但是很精緻，好評。
總之非常推薦，迪士尼酒店兩三千以上也是要坐大巴車，不像環球影城大酒店下樓就到，所以不如省下來的錢買禮賓服務，住得好玩的好。8.1暑假入院爆刷16項目看了一個演出，嘻嘻嘻

早餐很豐盛，但是快結束的半小時，服務員都忙着收桌子，補貨很不及時，找個空碗空盤子都沒有。
有一點不太舒服，去温泉前電話前台，是否需要帶房間內的浴袍一起，回覆是不用，温泉那裡有。到了温泉泡好出來，那裡的阿姨説這裏沒有,搞得衹能穿自己衣服，熱的要死，趕緊穿好趕緊走人。
還有温泉不夠熱，幾個池子的温度感覺都差不多，大冬天這種温度泡的不舒服。我在日本泡的池子零下3度都能熱到全是冒汗，作為一個標榜日式温泉的酒店，有所欠缺。
沒有來第二次的慾望。

msg:太喜歡這個酒店了，超級適合來迪士尼的小夥伴們。旺季入住，價格雖然不低但是衹有迪士尼酒店價格的一半，還送兩張1日成人票，你就説香不香吧！酒店位置就在迪士尼景區內，門口就有公交站坐1路公交幾分鐘到迪士尼了，非常方便。出門過馬路是比斯特購物村，很多大牌潮牌，吃飯也方便。酒店是日式風格的温泉酒店，環境雅緻、寧靜，我訂的是雅緻大床房，比一般酒店的套房面積還要大，配的智能馬桶，還有除濕機，吹乾衣服特別快。酒店的早餐也是用心準備的，種類不多但貴在精緻，煙燻三文魚、火炙焦糖三文魚壽司、土豆泥沙拉，雪菜肉絲麪等都很好吃。想想看早上吃得飽飽出發去迪士尼，一天玩累了回來到温泉館泡上一會兒很解乏的。據説温泉館湯池裡提供的是優質軟水。唯一不足的是一樓的房間會有點蚊子，插上電蚊香液就好一點了，如果酒店把防蚊處理好就更完美了。入住的兩天裏出現的一些小問題經理也很好的溝通處理了。總之這次的入住體驗很棒，值得推薦親子入住。下次來想體驗這裏的複式套房。

酒店裡麪像個度假村，一棟樓房子挺多，還有綠化隔開，辦理入住後有員工帶着介紹餐廳、温泉館等設施後，一路領到房門口，服務挺好。
温泉館去了兩次，一共四個池子，室內兩個室外兩個，水都很乾凈。
入住的時候酒店送了五個遊戲幣，可以在各個遊戲設施上使用，正好泡完温泉門口有個娃娃機衹要三個幣，想着隨便玩玩不花錢，就試了一次，結果一次就釣上來一衹醜萌豬，so lucky

還好衹是鐘點房，這家酒店更適合來迪士尼玩的親子家庭，價格確實不貴，而且還能泡湯。

另外，酒店房間整體包括內飾，還是很不錯的。個人感覺自帶湯池的房型會比基礎房好很多，因為水温更高。衹可惜就泡了一小會兒。
房間空調還是很足的，因為是改衣服，脊椎有點受涼了。大家別對着空調出風口別著涼了。

我家孩子今天是生日，昨天入住，我們是去迪士尼過的生日住了一晚，第二天來的百萬石，其實正常酒店看到這種，都會送個小蛋糕之類的，這些其實都無所謂，但是催着走真的是拉低了整個水準，退房後我們走出大堂，門口的禮賓人員看到我們出來故意轉頭看着遠方，這樣就可以減少一次打招呼的概率，就是今天4/9這天的門口的禮賓，我們中午退房時候走的這位工作人員。有時候就那麼幾個很小的動作，把整個團隊都拉下水。

門口祈願牌竟然説發完了沒有，也是有些失望。
住的4號樓的家庭房的地暖沒法用，父母的大床房5號樓的地暖就可以開很舒適。
早餐雖説是日式主打，但品種還是略少了，很多都沒有。
不出上海又想住温泉酒店的話，我還是會選擇這家。希望服務各方面還能優化一下。

msg:若以形神兼具為滿意的話，百萬石很難評，以日式温泉旅館為主題賣點，形略虛且神不足，然而下次還是會考慮再來。
首先缺點：
1.3000-5000的價位可以説是直逼市中心頂級夜景5星酒店了，然而房間內的陳列/設施/配套設備幾乎沒有（也許是日式美學的表達）一個無法連藍牙的音響，離床頭極遠的小電視，小到沒什麼內容的水吧等等。也許出門5分鐘步行到比斯特/迪士尼下位選擇是這個價格的理由吧。

2.設備：很硬還有點臟的榻榻米、壞掉的頂部花灑、碎掉的櫥櫃門把手等等。

3.服務：日本文化講究貼心極致的服務，然而在這一點上欠缺很多：
入住時再三表示飛機延誤我很餓然而不多給我一份免費點心。
打電話確認的時候就要求一個記憶枕，最後還得去前台重申一遍。
澡堂説是11點停業，但是10點就鎖門不讓進了。
而且澡堂服務人員永遠是你呼喊他才從前台出來，拿手牌要喊他，拿鞋子要喊他，設了一個迎賓台卻永遠沒人，傘交給員工洗完澡出來被別人拿了。
颱風天，房間離大堂有一段露天的路，大風大雨的，前台打電話來，我還以為會很貼心的問我辦退房需不需要幫忙搬行李以免被淋濕，結果衹接到了強硬的退房催促

4. 温泉：雖然這是主打的賣點，然而和温泉配套的一系列周邊卻沒有靈魂：露天池竟然不提供包頭的毛巾，洗好未乾的頭髮就任冷風在那吹啊吹；泡完出來的販賣機衹賣國產盒裝純牛奶，需要手機付款但是澡堂禁止用手機，掛帳系統好像也不互通，等待時間略長，斯密碼三～

5. 早餐品種真的很少，補貨也不勤，雖説味增湯和烏冬面真的很非凡，炸雞塊用的也是雞腿肉，但果然還是太少。

優點也有：
離比斯特真的很近，本來預訂行程裏沒有購物，但是步行幾分鐘就到了還是忍不住剁手了。

餐廳日料很正點，雖説價格略貴且刺身不夠完美，但調味很有一手可以直逼外面人均1500的日料水準了

雖説配套設備很少，但是有一台很大的除濕機，入住期間空氣質量很不錯

最後：床真的很軟 睡眠質量很有保證

msg:⁉️魔都度假放鬆酒店選哪裡？百萬石温泉度假酒店真是個解壓好去處！

👉某程買的酒店套餐，含雙早還附下午茶，和老公假裝遊日本咯！

📍地理位置
上海迪士尼度假區內，比斯特度假村旁，建議自駕形式，停車場停車位充裕，入住酒店停車免費。

✨酒店特色
1⃣️自帶温泉的酒店，極樂湯高端。
2⃣️酒店面積挺大的，日式庭院風，走走逛逛也是享受。
3⃣️酒店內就有shuttle bus，但也沒啥必要，走走也沒幾步，順便呼吸下新鮮空氣。
4⃣️離迪士尼樂園和比斯特都很近，買買玩玩很是便捷。
5⃣️酒店還有日式浴衣租借，打卡拍照很漂亮，可惜去的那天天工不作美，就不折騰。

🏨房間
我們入住的是最普通的房間，也還行，房內日式西式都有，房間非常暖和，冬天穿短袖就行了。房間窗外景色也不錯哦。

🍴餐飲
自助早餐品質還可以，下午茶一般性。晚餐沒有在酒店餐廳吃，可以選擇去比斯特。

❌缺點
温泉在單獨的地方，從所住樓棟走到極樂湯不是很近，加上天氣不好，路上還是蠻冷的，如果能像日本温泉酒店那樣的温泉街開在地下就更好。

對爸爸們來説，酒店自帶日式温泉，我們從迪士尼玩好回到酒店就去泡湯了，治癒了一天的疲憊。
酒店餐廳也不錯，推薦親自出行選擇，可以兼顧全家人的訴求～

不得不提的是日式的温泉也特別舒服。因為是內部賓客使用，人不多，有種泡私湯的感覺，晚上聽説女賓能看到煙花。
整體服務特別到位細緻入微。就説三個細節吧，一是搓澡的毛師傅，是我這麼多年搓澡最賣力氣，而且技術最好的師傅。不疼，但卡卡下灰，而且按摩非常舒服，是那種老師傅趕泥的手法。
二是我把行李寄存在温泉的前台，然後我就拖了鞋進去拿，等我回來的時候，門口的姐姐幫我把鞋換了個方便穿的方向，擺放整齊。不得不説，我的大漢腳，特別臭，整的我都不好意了。
三是男更衣區的服務員，真的是服務周到。而且在客人進門的時候雙手彎腰迎接。
確實是性價比超高的酒店。

温泉大堂一進去就是全覆蓋的地暖，非常舒適。泡湯分為室內和室外，分別各有兩個池子。15度左右的天在室外泡非常舒服，臉上涼颼颼，身體很暖和。裏面阿姨服務很好，特別親切。
温泉邊上有一片小朋友玩耍的草坪，設施不多，滑滑梯，鞦韆，蹦床。三五個玩伴一起的話，也可以玩挺久的。邊上有露營椅和天幕，坐着看娃也不累。
酒店後面的薰衣草園，雖然沒有看到薰衣草，但是大片的草坪很適合露營。
入住的時候碰到了一點點小問題，酒店的的陳經理完美解決了。贊一個！

酒店是一個妥妥的日式風格，沒有高樓，似乎最高是3樓了。這個感覺是一下就讓人沒有了鋼筋水泥的硬氣質，而是來到了生活。
我們的房間在一樓，可能是外面接近40度的高温，走廊裏的冷氣可真是冷氣啊。房間榻榻米風格，小冰箱隨便喝。就有一點，有事呢請拉上窗簾哈，外面就是步道，能看清路人的表情。下次記得訂2樓的房間。
酒店泡湯池沒得説，寬大明亮，日式坐浴，和兒子一起相互搓澡擦背，盡享天倫。室外魚旗飄飄，眯起眼睛看看藍天，頗有日風。話説日本人還挺認真，泡湯就是泡湯，沒有吃吃喝喝，玩玩樂樂，衹送牛奶一盒，可以在豆包沙發上躺躺。
酒店的日式餐廳水準頗高，兒子吃了幾頓照燒雞套餐。全家的晚餐套餐，非常豐盛，質量上成。以後記得在訂購套餐時注意包含這個晚餐套餐。
晚上的小酒時間，全家出動，穿着浴衣，來點小食，清酒和飲料（少爺點的）一邊聊，一邊聽着駐唱歌手的低唱淺吟。。。算是對少爺的啟蒙了。
酒店的位置很好，對面就是Outlet，晚上到高級套間的露台上就能看到迪斯尼的煙火，後門出去就是薰衣草公園，可惜天太熱，去走了10步，腦海中浮現出鐵板燒的情景，我們一家人都是鐵板上的牛肉和海鮮。。。
疫情影響，有些設施和活動都沒開，電影院啊，日式星期日集市啊。。。
待形勢好轉，秋高氣爽之日，重新再來過！

服務：剛走進大堂就有工作人員指引，都很耐心，而且這裏的工作人員很很有眼力見，住了這麼多酒店，我想説這裏的服務秒殺很多五星級酒店，細節真的超級到位，超讚！

房間設施：房間設施都很新，標準的簡約日式風格，很乾凈，雙床可以並在一起，因為在一個榻榻米床架上，帶娃的可以睡得很寬敞些，洗手間和洗澡淋浴都是乾濕分離

酒店設施：酒店裡走廊每隔十幾米就有販賣機賣日本的飲料和零食，很方便，還有一排排的扭蛋機，小朋友最開心啦[糖果]

泡湯：這裏的泡湯幾乎和日本沒設麼兩樣了，畢竟是極樂湯，室外兩個湯池，室內兩個湯池，週五泡的時候基本包場的節奏，很舒服，工作人員很熱心，洗完澡都會遞毛巾，天熱泡湯需要及時補充水分，阿姨也會熱心的幫忙倒水，服務超好

總之是一次愉快的入住體驗，各方面都留下了很好的印象，希望能一直保持這個水準，到時天冷了再準備去[親親][親親]

-團購了攜程的迷你大床房，週日入住的，店裡人不多，遇到的前台都很友善
-房間升級到了雅緻大床房，中規中矩，但勝在很安靜，住的2樓，沒有遇到點評上提到的很吵鬧的情況
-湯池人很少，基本包場，可以搓澡和SPA，價格合理
-早餐不算豐盛，但該有也都有，現做的有烏冬面，另外有一些日式早餐比如納豆和壽司
-套餐贈送的下午茶很好吃
-對面就是比斯特，購物吃飯很方便。坐公交可到迪士尼和迪士尼小鎮逛逛
-酒店內娛樂不多，喜歡安靜泡湯，週末度假還是很合適的

交通：自駕出行的話過去都很方便，週末人多各種停車場滿了，我們選擇把車停在酒店，步行或者做度假區的公交車出行，非常方便，馬路對面就是比斯特，買買逛逛都很方便。
衞生：房間很乾凈，因為在一樓，房間還配備了除濕機，房間地上和洗手間都非常乾淨，因為是温泉酒店，這個房間就沒有配備另外的浴缸。
環境：周邊環境還是比較好的，私密性做的很好，但是作為温泉酒店，温泉館是單獨的一棟樓，男女分開，説穿了就兩個池，一個室內一個室外，加上一個大約10平方的汗蒸房，男女湯應該也是配置一樣的，這個叫做温泉館，感覺有點牽強。問了酒店的多功能廳是否有設備在運行的，説是因為疫情沒有開放，衹有一個138/人的手工活動，餐廳有下午茶但是沒去，不知道性價比如何。
早餐：感覺還算不錯的是酒店早餐還可以，自助餐形式，品種不算太多，但是味道和品質都不錯。
入住期間，在房間迷你吧喝了一個可樂，一個雪碧，兩瓶水，退房收了我45，如果是碳酸飲料收費個人覺得是可以理解的，但最後也沒具體詢問，衹是覺得這個價位的酒店迷你吧是不是可以首日免費，最後，總體來説，作為這個價位的星級酒店，個人覺得性價比其實不那麼高。四星真的勉勉強強吧。

再説一下美中不足，餐廳的整體服務比較侷促。第一次是晚上點單，登記時候説了是預訂好的套餐，所以來吃飯時沒有再強調這點，以為會自動走菜。服務員等了好一會過來催促點單，溝通的態度生硬讓人有些不愉快。第二次是早上溝通希望可以拼個桌子吃飯，因為朋友一家帶個小嬰兒僅晚了幾分鐘過來，也許是怕我們佔用位置吧，很生硬的回覆我們不可以，理由是酒店最近客人太多，結果朋友來了以後旁邊依然很多空位，這種情況是否應該詢問清楚而不是乾脆拒絕？總體而言，理由都是因為客人太多，這也是理解的。但我想説，客人太多導致的服務問題，並不是客人的錯。任何情況下，換一個委婉的態度，都會讓雙方更舒適。

環境：絕佳
服務：泡湯服務絕佳。前台服務較好。禮賓部迎接時很熱情，但離店時真是掉鏈子。

房間裝修很好，浴室很先進。房間有地暖，入住的時候服務生就提醒千萬不要地暖和空調一起開。空調聲音有點響，選擇地暖呢睡覺又有點熱。晚上能聽到水管水流的聲音。希望以後來的時候設施能改進一些。

泡湯：因為疫情，前台提前告知了温泉水是處理後的軟水，如果是温泉水，更完美。水質很乾凈。兩天裏去了三次，每次都是包場的感覺。

餐廳：晚上的套餐中，和早餐，都是日式，特別要説的是，灼烤三文魚壽司的水準，可以比拼一些懷石料理的手藝。這道壽司，印象深刻。

服務：泡湯處的服務阿姨，服務非常好。我看到更衣室箱子的內測有提示：內衣袋子請諮詢服務員。於是問阿姨要袋子，阿姨説沒有袋子，我説那就算了，因為看到箱子裏有提示。沒想到阿姨馬上認真的去別處詢問，並且拿來的內衣袋。阿姨的原話是：我要問清楚的，可能後面也會有客人詢問。
餐廳的服務也熱情，會主動徵詢對於菜品的感受。套餐裏的壽喜鍋，是本人喜歡的關西壽喜鍋。

傳説中的6號樓2樓的蹭迪士尼煙花，被一棵樹，完美的遮擋了，翹首看了個寂寞。

總結：如果泡湯水是温泉水，可以再去體驗。

退房時和前台反應了這個情況，得到的回覆居然是冷漠的説了一句:“地暖雖然關掉了，但是散熱也需要時間的”，我去，難道需要散熱一晚上嗎？憑什麼酒店設施的缺陷要住客來買單。

晚上去泡了湯，一進門就有穿和服的工作人員過來為我們帶路，進去泡澡之後，衞生非常的乾淨，池中的水很清，用的洗護用品的香味也非常好聞，湯館的阿姨服務也非常周到，帶了小朋友阿姨也會幫忙照顧，整個過程都非常舒心，非常滿意的一次出行！

有個小插曲，酒店致電提醒我們把錢包遺漏在房間了，粗心的我們才發現這回事，非常感謝相關人員拾金不昧的行為，也感謝酒店帶給我們這次不錯的體驗。

早飯一般般，日式自助，可能期望太高了。

服務是絕對到位的，入住是Kitty接待，很耐心，很專業的介紹，辦理速度也很快。

msg:過年最後兩天去泡了湯，為了讓熊孩子能乾淨地在池子裏撲騰，也是花了大價錢。房間小，隔音不是很好，晚上能聽見隔壁屋在看奧運，整條温泉街有日本的感覺，可是我們又不住在街上。房間裏遙控器沒有反應，前台派了不專業的師傅來，連電池蓋也是LG給拔下來，換了電池好了。
極樂湯池子一共是內外四個，兩兩聯通，人很少，尤其我們是錯峯沐浴，在新年期間非常難得，可想而知平時人流量會更少，免費的牛奶很棒很好喝。但是論性價比，以後平日去比較值。早餐用餐時間可以看出酒店的熱鬧，空間還是不大，可選擇範圍也不多，沒有日式感覺。出遊很方便，門口就有公交車1塊錢兩站直達迪士尼，但畢竟在上海過年住酒店的大多數都是上海人，不需要跑很遠，所以這方面酒店沒有任何娛樂設施。前台服務有待提高，辦理入住發現有客人在投訴沒有送和果子，然鵝也沒有告知我minibar首輪免費，都是要自己問上去，不夠細緻吧。
總結：百萬石不能體現百萬價值，性價比低，勝在人少。

msg:環境和設施還不錯，但是服務真的…我們辦理入住，自己走進去就算了反正大堂都長一樣找的到，但是辦理好入住後，辦理人員説有同事會告訴我們怎麼到房間的，然後我們一回頭，同事在哪呢？然後我就站在大廳裏，看着他們的同事接待完其他客人，然後從我媽媽背後走過去，直接無視了我們……我是體積太小了所以看不到我嘛……一瞬間想到其他評論，恩…沒關係，有心理準備了。（也怪我，不想大喊“服務員我們這裏需要去房間有人來接待嘛”）
房間挺好看的，而且樓層很高，一點不壓抑，用的沐浴產品都是品牌的，鏡子也是很大的智能鏡，房間也沒有怪味，房間裏就有日式的浴袍（但就一個腰帶，我記得我以前買的浴袍衹有3根帶子的）可以隨時換上，還有外出的外套，我們去的2天都下雨，但是氣温還能接受，穿着浴袍和外套外出也不太冷。
晚上去温泉館，哎，看着有的評論説泡完喝個冰鎮牛奶，特別舒服，我幻想了，結果是我想太多，但評論説的沒錯，可是呢，還是我想的太多了。
泡了一會兒就發生了2起顧客不滿事情（1:孩子太小不能泡，沒問題！大人想進去泡個腳，然後在進去之前不説，人家進去後説泡腳要穿浴袍…浴袍在房間）（2:還有人問去温泉館穿什麼，得到的回答是穿自己衣服，人家就以為温泉館和外面泡湯一樣有浴袍什麼的，之後就尷尬了）最後2個都得到了解決！！真的慶幸，裏面阿姨不能解決的問題，如果能更快一步去找外面工作人員，講不得那幾個顧客就不會生氣了。
最後是我最不能接受的…早飯！我是9:20左右去的吧，一進去發現，自助餐枱前大家都在排隊（我記憶裏其他地方的自助餐是拿完就走了，一個拿好了走了去拿下一個，第二個人再拿，應該比較迅速的，我説的排隊是，2-3分鐘我的位置就沒動過，還有阿姨插隊）就像是在菜場，每個攤頭前都有人在買菜一樣還要挑挑揀揀，不知道是餐廳太小了，還是菜品放置有問題，還是顧客的問題……
總之，體驗下來就是不值這個價格

msg:一到酒店，從外觀和裝潢來看，就覺得極樂湯這次的確是用心了，裏裡外外和在日本住的高級温泉館非常一致，真的有假裝在日本的錯覺。
先誇誇做得好的地方。
房間超大，而且都裝了地暖，所以體感非常舒適。小冰箱裏也給了不少飲料～正當我和男朋友遺憾地説日本温泉旅館都會給一份歡迎小點心在茶几上的，就有服務員敲門給送來了，還特別好吃！
温泉離房間距離適中，室內室外各兩個泡池，雖然我們入住當天是滿房狀態，池子裏也沒有特別擁擠，衹有晚上帶孩子來的稍微多一些。選的洗護用品品質也不錯。
更衣室裏的阿姨特別親切，遞毛巾，遞頭繩，還主動給寄腰帶。
當然也有不足的地方。
首先迎賓我是非常不滿意的。前台不知道是人手不足還是怎麼，大門口沒有接待的人，到了前台，辦好入住，説是讓我坐着等一下，等會兒有人帶去房間，但有人手空出來後沒有交接好，讓我傻坐在沙發上等了好久，最後還是我反過來問了，才有人帶我們走。
其次，温泉館也似乎人手不夠，進門的鞋櫃系統過於複雜，給手牌的姑娘要門口總枱兩邊跑，造成了門口來了客人不知道怎麼用鞋櫃，裏面又有客人要退手牌姑娘抽不開身，然後姑娘就被罵了（親耳聽到，替她委屈一分鐘）。並且，温泉裏不能帶毛巾進去我也是第一次聽説，不太能理解。然後，可能是怕客人不理解泡温泉的傳統會投訴，這裏索性就沒有提供冰水，免費給的牛奶也是常温的。
最後，房間隔音有點差，早上退房高峯的時候，門外拉行李箱，小孩吵吵鬧鬧，大人訓斥他們的聲音聽得一清二楚。

套票帶無限次温泉，人少，包場，感覺還不錯，房間中規中矩，房間裏唯一想吐槽的是，就不能給個大一點的桌子嘛！😅😅😅
停車挺方便的，但是有一點，我們的套餐包含商務車接送迪士尼一次的，我的理解是，應該我們隨時想去就可以預訂，但是前台小哥哥很決絕地告訴我，沒有，就是班車，上午三個時間段，晚上兩個時間段，要提前預約！我後來第二天看到門口的商務車了，我覺得前台小哥肯定搞錯了！害我門自己開車去的迪士尼，停車費貴死！
早餐超乎想象，比預期的好，東西挺多的，味道也不錯。服務也很盡心，但是沒有小童餐具，衹要到一個小塑料勺給寶寶用。迪士尼周邊，不是應該主打親子嗎！寶寶用品不齊全的話，應該也不能算合格的親子吧！
最後最後要嚴厲批評的一點，午餐，我們兩個大人是套餐裏含的鰻魚飯，據説是活殺，所以很慢很慢，這點我們很理解，整體鰻魚三吃也不錯。給寶寶要了炸豬排套餐，結果寶寶套餐衹吃了飯和蒸雞蛋，豬排吃了一條，就不要吃了，一整份豬排等於完全沒有動，我就讓服務員小哥大包，令人最難以理解的事情發生了，小哥説，沒有打包盒，沒有打包盒，沒有打包盒！😣😣😣😣😣，這真是太難以理解了，已經開了三個多月的酒店內的餐廳，前一晚説沒有送餐服務也就算了，我能理解，這沒有打包盒，我一整份豬排就衹能白白浪費了，心疼到現在呀………………
