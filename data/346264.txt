The location requires getting a taxi or hiring bikes. Also worth noting that the hotel is on the side of a hill so a steep walk back up if using a bike. Overall would recommend but probably better to eat out in the evenings. Staff helpful throughout the stay so no complaints.

They provide shuttle to the hill villa where we stayed and any time we wanted to go out from the room we just called to the reception and they send us a shuttle very fast.

The breakfast was just perfect! They had Western dishes as well as Chinese. They had different kinds of cheese, hams, sausages, scrambled eggs, veggies, pancakes, waffles and many many more! I really loved the breakfast and without a doubt I can say that it was one the best breakfasts I’ve had in hotels in Xiamen! 

There’s a gym, indoor swimming pool, pool with hydro massage, sauna, café, playground for the kids in this hotel and a nice territory full of trees and flowers where you can take a walk. 

The only thing is that hotel is a little bit old and need some small renovations. For example the floor in our room (1108) was full of scratches, TV had some connection problems in the beginning, the small round mirror in the bathroom which is supposed to have a light and night light above the bed - didn’t work. The rest is all good! 

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a nice and relaxing stay!

The executive lounge provided a buffet dinner plus a reasonably selection of drinks, and coffee and soft drinks were available at other times. Oh, and the room had a coffee press and fresh coffee! The pool was quiet and pleasant for swimming. The breakfast was great with a huge selection, and, since it was Chinese New Year, a special dance performance was organised in the hotel foyer during breakfast time.

There was a small accident in the middle of the night during our stay. The hotel handled it promptly and helped us change rooms. (Thanks to the managers and interns on duty at midnight on the 4th to 6th)

However, the service staff are warm and thoughtful. The young man who greeted me at the door took the initiative to help with luggage, especially the lady in room 3025 on the third floor. The waiters always have a smile every time we meet and make you feel very comfortable. The rooms all have balconies with views of the mountains and the hotel's water. Due to the fact that it has been open for a long time, the carpets and floor tiles in the room also have signs of time. Although the service staff cleaned very carefully, the stains have solidified and it seems that they need to be renovated. Breakfast is also good. Free children's breakfast is provided when you check in. Thumbs up.
The disadvantage is that it is located halfway up the mountain, so you need to take a taxi to go to Xiamen's attractions.

The hotel swimming pool is open after 7pm. There was no one there on the day I went to the gym, so I had a lot of fun practicing both aerobic and non-aerobic exercises for a while.

The hotel staff are very friendly. We were given a free room upgrade. Everyone I met was kind. Whatever happened was solved quickly. On the first day we found that the refrigerator was not cooling and they quickly replaced it for us.

In terms of location, it's not far from the airport. It's also very close to the city. There is a subway 2 kilometers around.

The winter in Xiamen is really warm, and the temperature is not too cold in the mountains. I really like the architectural design and landscape-style environment of Le Meridien Hotel. At that time, there was heavy snow in the Northeast, but now Xiamen is warm and sunny.
According to Edison at the front desk, the hotel has been in existence for more than ten years, but the facilities are still well maintained. This time, I finally chose to stay in a suite in the villa (it has a very resort style, and the duplex has two floors. It is really the best hotel I have ever stayed in. It can be the top three). In order to give my girlfriend a birthday surprise, I troubled many hotel employees, but they all responded enthusiastically and helped, and finally gave my girlfriend an unforgettable birthday surprise; especially Jasmine, Ray, Edison, and Jimmy at the front desk. Simon, the concierge, was impressive.
The hotel is on a mountain, and there are many places to visit. It's just inconvenient to buy things, but luckily you can take out. I have to go back to Northeast China today. I hope I can come to Xiamen again in the summer.

Let me talk about a few unsatisfactory places: 1. Hygiene. When I checked in on the first day, the shower in the bathroom was not closed properly, so that when it leaked, the bathroom was full of water. 2. Parent-child package. The first time I stayed in a hotel that required an additional fee for the children's park, the front desk explained that they are a business hotel, so if the package you booked did not send the ticket, you need to pay, fine. 3. I placed two orders on two platforms. I also told the front desk about it on the first day of check-in. The front desk helped to open all the check-in times. As a result, I received a call in the middle of the time asking why I didn't check out. It felt very nonsensical.

msg:I used to stay here before the epidemic, and I have been to Xiamen several times during the epidemic, but I stayed in other hotels. This time I stayed at Le Méridien for seven days. After the epidemic, the prices of hotels and inns in Xiamen and all over the country have increased. In general, a five-star hotel like Le Méridien thinks the price is more reasonable, 800 a day including two breakfasts, and maybe all seasons or Atour are also priced at this price. Le Méridien's service is pretty good, from the front desk to the guest room, but the service in the restaurant is average. I don't think the waiters in the restaurant smile as a whole. There is also a villa area in the hotel. Even when it is full, it feels very quiet. At first, I thought that there were no people living there. I went to the restaurant for breakfast and found that there were many people. There are many sea view rooms, and the mountain view room feels green outside the window. Very good, especially during the typhoon, but it doesn't feel very serious here, the wind is blocked, the hotel also has a 24-hour battery car that can take you up and down the mountain, and there is an hourly bus that can be sent to Zhongshan Road and so on. place, but only until three o'clock in the afternoon at the latest. Takeaway cannot be delivered to the room, but you can call the front desk and they will deliver it. The hotel's underground parking lot needs to go up to the lobby on the first floor, and then change to the elevator to go up. The hotel is on Xianyue Mountain. If you have time and like to exercise, you can go climbing early in the morning and pay homage to the land god.

msg:I took my mother and children to Xiamen for a trip. I stayed on the island on the first day. After visiting many parent-child hotels in the next three days, I finally chose Le Méridien. The old brand was not disappointed. The hotel has a great view on the mountainside. The front desk staff checked us in very enthusiastically. We booked a parent-child room in the villa. Every time we enter and leave the room, we need a shuttle bus to decide. The waiters are very kind. The room is not very big, but the bathroom is big, and there is a big bathtub. Children like to take a bath every day, watching TV while taking a bath, hahahaha. The breakfast variety is quite rich, both Chinese and Western buffets are available, and children enjoy it too. The hotel also has a children's playground, which is not very big, but enough for children to play. The swimming pool is also a favorite of children. You can find other children to play with in it. It's very fun. It's not boring to stay in the hotel if you don't go out. I am very satisfied with my stay this time, and the children are clamoring to stay again next time~

The bed in the room is moderately soft and firm, and the scenery outside the window is really beautiful.
The breakfast variety is very rich, thumbs up; lunch can be delivered to the room, which really satisfies my hobby of being too lazy to move.
There is also a gym in the hotel. The young lady at the front desk received us enthusiastically and took us to visit the gym and swimming pool. She also recommended surrounding attractions and food. The young lady seems to be called Lorien. Her smile is so healing (I really love it). ,
Although I only stayed at Le Meridien for one night, the experience was really great!

There is no noise in the urban area, but it is very close to the urban area. As soon as I got off the bus, the doorman helped me unload the luggage and guide me to the front desk. Check in, Jimmy, the manager at the front desk, was also very enthusiastic when he checked in. Although he was very busy during the summer vacation, he also patiently introduced us to the hotel's facilities and equipment. On the way down to get takeout, he ran into Simon, the concierge manager. It was a casual consultation. On the shuttle bus down the mountain, the manager saw that we had brought our children out to play, so he asked us if we had made a travel plan, and introduced us to the attractions in Xiamen and the places where the children could go to play. He observed carefully and meticulously. Ability, people have to sigh the unique service charm of this hotel

Breakfast has many varieties but few choices. So a bunch of people gathered together to cook noodles. The guy who cooked the noodles was probably too busy and had a bad attitude. I took my own noodle (No. 5) and asked if the noodle No. 6 would be good too? He immediately choked me and said, you can't get two portions at once, come back later.

Unlike other five-star hotels where tissues are placed, there is only one box of tissue paper in the entire room, and it is placed on the bathroom counter. It is easy to find. There is no tissue paper on the bedside table or desk. I need a tissue. You have to run around, which I think needs to be improved; in addition, the mineral water is also placed in the bathroom, instead of being put together with the kettle, tea bags, etc., so you still have to run to the bathroom. As for the minibar, the refrigerator was empty when I opened it, and there were no free drinks.

Just staying in the hotel, drinking coffee and breathing is an extremely happy time! There is no need to go out to check in and line up for meals at scenic spots. The food in the hotel is also very good, the buffet is cheap and has many varieties, and there is also a small hot pot, only 168¥ per person! Much cheaper than Beijing, the fruit is also very sweet, and the ingredients are fresh~
Not to mention the service, the front desk is warm, efficient, quick to deal with problems, very thoughtful, very impressed with Ms. Lacey! Next time I come back, I will definitely stay at Le Méridien again! ! ! If there is no Le Méridien, I am afraid this trip would not be so pleasant and memorable!

When I came back in the evening, I also sent welcome fruits. I feel ➕ points. There were a lot of people at breakfast, and the waiter was orderly. Seeing that I was waiting for coffee, he took the initiative to ask me what flavor I wanted and where to sit, and it was delivered after a while. The front desk answers the phone quickly and has standards, but I feel that the intern doesn't seem to agree with his choice. When I was waiting for the car to go to the room at the gate, the doorman was complaining about the low salary. The intern was 2000, and the regular was 2800. Haha, but it seems is a little less. When I went back in the evening, I heard that the supervisor and the doorman were arguing. Why should the guests complain? Alas, this situation should be due to the lack of corporate culture propaganda during training. In short, the trea**ent and professionalism of employees need to be strengthened. , the ultimate damage is the hotel itself.

Let's just say that this Marriott's five-star Le Méridien hotel has average facilities and poor service like a two- or three-star hotel.
First of all 1⃣️When I checked in, I asked the service staff to send the disposable toothbrush supplies upstairs later. They didn’t arrive until 10 o’clock in the evening when I brushed my teeth, so I went down to get them.
2⃣️I have never seen any hotel that does not deliver takeaways upstairs. Even if it is an epidemic, many other hotels have delivered them. The front desk said it was for food safety? But I ordered an eyebrow pencil, dear, not to mention it will not be given if there is a robot in the hotel
3⃣️Fitness people should not come to Le Meridien. It’s really persuasive to retire. The gym is so small that there is only one yoga mat, which is worth ten dollars. There is no gantry, and Smith does not. Instead, there are two chest pushers and two leg lifts, speechless, I want an elastic band head office? No 🤷‍♀️
Last 4⃣️The most speechless thing is that I booked one night each because of Fliggy and Ctrip, but they were connected. When I checked in, I told them clearly, and the manager also said that they were already hanging in the same room. As a result, the next night I was so tired that I couldn't get in with my room card, but I still called the front desk to send the card up...
Oh, there is 5⃣️Now I am going to Gulangyu to do 48h nucleic acid. No one in the hotel reminded me. When I checked in, I asked the manager to go to Gulangyu to play and so on. I did not say that there is no meaning to blame the hotel (just the sense of service...
Well, there is the last 6⃣️ I got up in the morning and brushed my teeth and went downstairs to the restaurant for breakfast, but I was driven back. Said that the restaurant cannot wear bathrobes and hotel slippers. Hehe, in the words of my husband: it is understandable that you can't wear bathrobes, and you can't wear slippers for one-time use. This hotel seems to need our guests to serve it instead of providing services to the guests🤷‍ ♀️
Marriott really wants to rectify this Le Méridien, it’s too crotch. It’s really

The soundproofing of the room can still hear the sound of high heels upstairs in the early morning, and the sound of the door closing in the morning can be heard. Aside from Marriott, this Le Méridien is estimated to be unable to compete for the entire season. A 10-year hotel can be understood for a long time. The disrepair is very speechless. The water from the shower room can overflow under the entrance through the underground, and the shower water is sprayed everywhere. There are better choices for the same price in Xiamen.

There is a problem with the concierge (the last name is Zhao) I just got out of the car and took the luggage out of the trunk. The trunk door was not closed and the box was still lying down. There were other cars waiting for me with the bag in my hand.

[Candy] The swimming pool is indoor, but I was told that it would be cleaned and closed the next morning.
[Candy] There is an outdoor children’s playground, but it’s too sunny in summer, so I can only visit it early in the morning and night, that is, slides and swings.
[Candy] Children aged 6-12 years old have to make up 87 for breakfast, but over 140 will be charged as an adult, and an additional 100 will be charged. This rule makes people feel very speechless. Either only the age or height is required. Let’s ask How many children aged 10-12 have no more than 140?

Generally speaking, there is nothing special about a five-star hotel. The price/performance ratio is average. There is no place to go around. You need to drive or take a taxi to go out.

msg:🔔Service: This is a bad review, all bad reviews are given to the management of the service and hotel service staff!

I originally booked through Marriott's official website. Why does this bad review appear here? Because when I checked in, the front desk manager even suggested that I rebook or even change hotels through Ctrip!

I have been a member of the Marriott Titanium Card for many years, and basically upgrade to a larger room or suite every time I stay. I brought my wife and children on this trip, and I would need a larger room. The official website customer service told me that I would try to upgrade a larger room before moving in. Upon check-in, the room was told that the room was tight and could not be upgraded. I suggested that I only want a larger room to see if I can make up the difference and upgrade. The front desk can’t reply. I suggest that I return the booking on the official website and go to Ctrip or change the hotel (this is the front desk manager’s direct response in person). I was very confused at the time,

I checked Ctrip and booked this children's suite, and when I made the reservation, I noticed that basically all room types in the hotel are on sale! Some questions about the hotel's reply!

After booking, the front desk informs that the room is being cleaned and you can move in within an hour. I wandered around the hotel this hour and noticed that the concierge was playing around and squatting on the ground! ? I returned to the front desk an hour later and was told that I was not sure how long it would take to move in!

I also asked about the children's playground. The front desk introduced me to the business hours. After I checked in, I told my son that I could take him to play the next day. Early the next morning, I was told that the children's playground was closed for about a week. Asked the front desk again and replied that she forgot that the children's playground was closed! ?

When I went outside to play and returned to the hotel, the concierge asked me to show the health code itinerary code. I expressed my understanding. Suddenly, a man got down from a commercial car next to him. He was not asked at all. The concierge replied that he was too busy? I also don't know where we have been this day, we must ask for itinerary code.

All these decisions made me write down my first negative complaint. After I complained to the official website, the manager called several calls a day to suggest that I return the booking of Ctrip and help me upgrade through the official website. I refused. Didn’t you say that the room was full before? Didn’t I suggest that I book through Ctrip before?

Finally, when I checked out, the hotel manager contacted me and asked me where I would stay behind? Do you need to contact Marriott's sister hotel to help me say hello! ? What does it mean? What do you say hello? Tell your sister hotel that this guest complained about you? Do you need to be careful about this guest?

Haha, never live in this Le Méridien again! Marriott, please audit this hotel.

msg:The hotel is halfway up the Xianyue Mountain, with a beautiful environment and fresh air. It is more difficult to call a car during the rush hour on Friday. It is very convenient to use a car during other times. At the same time, the hotel has its own trolley that can pick up and drop guests from the hotel and the foot of the mountain, which is very convenient. The service staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic and enthusiastic. After checking in, we learned that we had two rooms with the old and the young and one of the rooms had to be changed in the middle of the room, so we upgraded the room and arranged them all on the same floor of the main building. The room is very large, the outside living room and the inside bedroom, double bathrooms, children have enough space for activities, the arrangement of the little yellow ducks, and large toys such as tents and slides. The children especially like them. They want to take the ducks away before leaving. I consulted the hotel for not having the same style. You can buy stuffed toys, which is a pity. The hotel’s central air-conditioning is very comfortable and not dry at all, but you need to be mentally prepared for two or three days to dry your own laundry. The hotel’s breakfast is delicious, rich in variety and fresh food, very suitable for the elderly and children. The swimming pool has a soaking pool, which is a good place for children to swim and play in the water. Children like to play in the water. The outdoor children’s playground of the hotel is very large, but it is too sun-dried during the opening hours. It would be better if the opening hours can be extended to the evening, but at this time mosquitoes are coming again, and a good environment will inevitably have more mosquitoes. There is a small children’s playground outside the gymnasium of the hotel. There is an ocean ball pool, reading area, some small toys, and full of climbing mats. It is enough for children to play. When we were about to leave the hotel, the children said that they would stay here next time.

msg:I ordered a set meal that includes breakfast. The breakfast is very rich and satisfying. It’s interesting that a foreign chef is making pancakes. The fruit should be the executive chef of the hotel. The taste is also very good. The hotel is located in the middle of a mountain and surrounded by greenery. come. It was a bit of a surprise to call the hotel before I came. The operator’s greeting turned out to be "Hey..." This kind of opening statement shouldn't be your standard. In addition, the staff had a lack of knowledge about hotel products during the stay. Since many people like to take the logo of the hotel in Picture 1, I asked four or five employees where this place is, but I don’t know, there is even one person who said it’s not his own hotel...

msg:Because it is a hotel in the mountains, I chose to spend my holiday here, but the scenery is really average, which is a bit disappointing. The children’s paradise is extremely fun, but it’s too hot, and children can’t hold on after half an hour of playing. The breakfast is very rich, two big and one small is still very cost-effective. This is the first time I stayed in such an expensive hotel. Indeed, the design of the guest rooms is very high, and many things are tightly hidden. The bathtub is very comfortable, so buy a few bathtub covers and soak at ease. The swimming pool is very clean, because there are basically no people, and sometimes it is reserved and it is very comfortable. Overall it is worth the fare.

The meal ordered by the hotel at noon, after eating, the plate was placed at the door and said to receive it immediately, but it was still there in the room at night. The first day I stayed in the room on the 2nd floor, the room was a bit damp and smelled great. The next day I booked an upgraded room and moved to the 6th floor. My shower gel and shampoo fell in the room on the 2nd floor. I found out that I had to take a shower at night, and the hotel didn't take the initiative to call to inform! !

msg:There is a children’s amu*****t park in the hotel, which is very suitable for children, but the service is relatively poor. It is obvious that we bring 2 more children and deliberately arranged for us a room with a small smelly bed on the first floor. This excuses me to wait an hour, and deliberately did not answer the second call, but the lady from the guest room who looked like the service manager was very good, and she was very happy to change to 3 mouthfuls. A twin room with a larger bed, the breakfast is good, but it is very inhumane that our two children are less than 1.2 meters, as a result, when we go to the children’s playground behind the second floor of the hotel, we are only willing to give 1 child free. My other child’s 58 yuan was deducted at the checkout. It’s really unconventional. The next day we changed rooms to Marriott Hotel. All hotel children’s facilities are free. Knowing that I have 2 children, I also gave away dolls and small children. flip flop

This time I rushed to the outdoor children's playground behind the second floor. By the way, I had dinner and breakfast at the hotel. It’s great to eat, live and play! Not enough children! Especially recommended for family trips, and the new five-star hotel opened in Xiamen, Le Méridien is very cost-effective!

不足：比較失望的是2樓特色粵式自助。9月6日中午，因為前台特別推薦，所以放下行李就去嘗試了。餐廳是點餐式的自助，所以每一輪點餐都需要請服務員來下單。一開始還好，但到第二輪想加餐的時候，很明顯服務員就很不耐煩了。最後一次想加，可能臨近下班了，就顯得特別不耐煩，還直接甩臉色。

會硌腳，早上自助餐花樣多，午餐我們都選擇中餐，實惠量大，很好吃，推薦海膽炒飯👍！第一天入住是前台小豪接待，態度非常好，晚上就決定續住一晚，由於有團，在已經漫房的情況下前台小華努力幫房鎖了兩間房，而且安排的很妥當，特別感謝這兩個前台小哥哥小姐姐，這次住店很愉快，還會再次選擇嘉華！

수영장은 온수풀장이여서 가족들과 수영하기 너무 좋았습니다.

조식부페는 사람들이 많이 붐비는 시간만 피하면 조용하게 다양하고 맛있는 음식을 먹을수 있었던거 같습니다.

샤먼에 다시간다고 하면 르메르디안 호텔에 다시 머물고 싶습니다.

msg:The hygiene of the guest room is poor and the cleaning lady is not careful. The guest asked if breakfast could be started at 6 o'clock. After the night manager gave permission, he waited on the sofa in the lobby outside the restaurant at 5:40 in the morning. But Jimmy, the manager on duty the next day, reminded the guests not to go to the restaurant early? ? ? They also told me that there were no female colleagues dedicated to serving me! Jimmy denied the request that was communicated before moving in. Of course, the breakfast and welcome fruits made people feel too stressed and overburdened! When I needed fruit the next day, I was told by the manager on duty that there was no welcome fruit. For such a big hotel, I want to tell this manager Jimmy that you are just a service staff, and your service objects are human beings. You have no right to choose to serve guests. You cannot represent the hotel, you only represent yourself! Male and female guests have different requirements. I hope you can see your shortcomings. I am a pregnant woman and am deeply offended that this hotel has the lowest front office rating of any hotel I have ever stayed at. If you want to experience the service level of this hotel's front office, especially the duty manager, make your own judgment!
