No apologies we’re given, and staff seemed nonchalant about the inconvenience. I understand that some issues may come up, but it would’ve been nice if some urgency was given toward those who were inconvenienced on the floor (or even a notice to let us know the hot water isn’t working).

2. The room facilities are outdated and the size of the TV cabinet is not as big as that of the All Seasons Hotel.
3. Without any intelligent equipment, is it difficult to install a small device? Basically everything is done manually.
4. There are mosquitoes in the room on the 19th floor. I don’t know how to clean it, and there is no electric mosquito coil. It smells musty. There is no fragrance here at all that many hotels should have.
5. When ordering a takeaway, the customer has to go downstairs to get it. The elevator itself is very inconvenient. Ask customer service and tell them about food safety. Isn’t this nonsense? Can’t robots deliver food? It shows that the management ideas are still from the last century.
6. I am completely sorry for this brand and this location. I also booked it on the highway and forgot to read the comment section. I regret it. I have been to Nanjing many times and the price is more than 1,000. It is definitely not of this level. It is embarrassing!
7. Don’t always talk about your good catering and good supporting facilities. Remember, the first experience is when guests come to check in. Don’t turn the hotel into a restaurant.
8. If there is no such thing as automatic curtains, don’t show it on the video. At a small level, it is opportunistic. At a large level, it is a matter of integrity.
9. Finally, I hope this comment can give every customer a reliable reference.

msg:The worst check-in experience of this trip. Starting from the check-in in the lobby, there were three front desks for check-in. Guests queued up to wait. After the three front desks finished checking in, none of the three front desks took the initiative to prompt the next customer. Is it possible to handle it when there are other guests standing? Customers have to ask themselves! Unfortunately, I ran into a situation where my front desk clerk, who was the only one in front of me, finished handling the business piled up in front of her after all the 4, 5, and 6 people behind me had finished checking in. After checking in, I went upstairs to open the door. That was the beginning of my disappoin**ent. The carpet was full of stains. There was a door to the room next door. Although the door was closed, it was really not soundproof. The children next door were very noisy! I took out my mobile phone and took a look. The Ctrip rating was 4.1, which was petrified. I decided to book it when I was feeling depressed. I thought it was a Sheraton, but it was at the level of a guest house! The Sheraton where I stayed in Hefei the day before yesterday was almost different from the feeling of several express hotels. The shock is not over yet. I take a shower at night and find that the shower head is fixed and cannot move. So no matter how strong you are, when the shower head turns on, you have nowhere to hide in the small shower room. Take a cold shower first! The standard of the room is not even three-star, and even if the children watch TV, it will be covered with snowflakes! In short, I will never stay at Nanjing Kingsley Sheraton again in this life! Also, can Ctrip recommend some reliable ones? After booking so many hotels, why can’t we make targeted recommendations based on customers’ preferences? Would you rank such a shabby hotel in the top 5 for me?

The room configuration has declined. The disposable comb is similar to that of a general business hotel, and the slippers are also very thin. In summer, there is no mineral water in the sink, and the room does not have too much mineral water at one time.
The bedding in the room was a bit damp and felt wet all the time.
The hotel is relatively cost-effective, and the location is relatively convenient. It is about 300 meters away from the subway station. It is very convenient to go out by subway or take a taxi. There is a security cabinet outside the back door of the hotel, which is more convenient for takeaway meals.

Takeaway can only be picked up from the dining cabinet outside the hotel, which is very inconvenient. The shower in the shower is broken, and the temperature cannot be adjusted. It is either cold or very hot. I called the front desk late at night. The front desk found a master to overhaul it. He came empty-handed and told me to slow down. Slowly adjust, I let him go, and then slowly adjust the switch still does not work. I went to try the shower attached to the bathtub, it was normal, and it had nothing to do with the speed of the switch to adjust the temperature. I'm not calling anymore, because I'm too lazy to change rooms. It was finally going to bed, but the spotlight opposite the bed couldn't be completely turned off, and there was always light and shadow. The sound insulation is also very poor, you can't hear the movement of the tenants on both sides too clearly.

The disadvantage behind the unique geographical location is that the parking spaces cannot meet the needs of rapid development with each passing day. The newly refurbished hotel rooms are full of youthful and trendy a**osphere, and the invincible high-rise city view has a clear view. The bubble bath essential oils in the bathroom are definitely good news for those who like to take a bath! The More coffee shop in the lobby on the first floor is cheap and affordable. The only suggestion is that the speed of check-in at the front desk can be slightly improved. I arrived at the store after 12 noon yesterday, and stood at the front desk to check in and waited for nearly ten minutes. In terms of the price of ¥1500 without breakfast, it is still remarkable overall.

From the reception in the foyer to the reception in the lobby, floor guidance, restaurant ordering, and floor cleaning, they are all warm and thoughtful, and the service is just right. Room service is on call and responsive. In this tourist-popular provincial capital city, there are more than 1,000 five-star hotels with breakfast included, which is very cost-effective.

1. The room arrangement was chaotic. I wanted a west-facing room. When I arrived, the hotel told me that there was no west-facing deluxe twin room. Later, I found out that there was one by accident, and insisted on changing the room before I arranged it;

2. The facilities are old, and the room card couldn't open the door the next day. I waited at the door for 10 minutes before the hotel staff went upstairs to open the door. The toilet experience is very poor, and the situation occurs frequently;

3. Personal daily necessities were lost in the room!

4. The sound insulation effect is not good. As a person who sleeps well, I was woken up by the next door twice!

The overall experience is not as good as the 300-a-night express hotel where my friends stayed. As a person who has never given a bad review to a hotel, I really can't complain! ￼

2. The room service made me dizzy again. I booked two rooms, and the miscellaneous fee for the other room was 356 yuan. I ordered two bowls of pasta in the room (I remember it was 78 yuan a bowl, it should not be 156 yuan a bowl), Added a small bed (the small bed is 200 yuan, which I paid when I registered). When I left on the morning of the 16th, I handed the room card to the front desk, and after I packed my luggage, I asked again, and the other party said it was ok. Today, I received a deducted bill from Ctrip, including 356 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, plus the 200 yuan I paid at the front desk, a total of 556 yuan. After contacting and verifying, it was returned to me.
3. The Marriott Group makes money from management output. This kind of management level really needs to be improved!

1. Too bad, the price of Porsche, the configuration of the tractor. I saw a lot of complaints on the Internet, and I was lucky to think that everyone asked for a lot. I was shocked when I lived in it. It should be the level of an economical hotel. Does Sheraton no longer have a brand? How is Nanjing's five-star standard rated?
2. Turn off all the lights during the middle of the night, but the lights kept flashing by themselves. I called the front desk to find someone to watch, and it took me a long time to come up. I was scared to death at 12:30 in the middle of the night! Is there a problem with this Feng Shui?
3. The attitude of the waiter is excellent. If the hardware is extremely poor, the waiter is relatively in line with the five-star standard, and quickly changed my room, and then gave me breakfast.
In summary, I will definitely not come to live in the future.

Check in at around 12 o’clock, and tell me to wait after 6 minutes, okay , went out to eat, came back into the room, there was a musty smell, and the ventilation was not good. 2.

Fortunately, the chat industry was not in a hurry, thinking about it and urging, 10 minutes later an uncle came in with a look of foolishness, without knocking on the door (the door was open), without any greetings, one sentence: there is no decanter, I can only open it for you, and after opening it, I wandered out. I was petrified the whole time. . . Five-star, big brother, don't you have any training for the job? ? ? Five star! ! ! There is no basic courtesy and respect, bad review

So obvious things can't be found? Or did your waiter take it away, or did you just not bother to look for it? If the customer still throws something away, just throw it away, and if someone asks, just say no! The things are worthless. As a hotel service, these are basic, and the quality is too poor. I often go to Nanjing, so learn from the services of other hotels. Poor review! Never going there again! !

There was a small episode in the middle, shaving injured and snowing. I ordered a medicine takeaway, but I couldn't go downstairs to get it. I asked room service to help me get it from the front desk.

How could I know that the ancient air conditioner in the room was simply decoration. The temperature didn't make any difference at all, and it froze to death after taking a shower. I was woken up by the cold at 4:00 in the middle of the night. Fortunately, the room service was online 24 hours a day, and they brought us quilts and heaters. I really can't figure out that this is a five-star standard? ? ?
The room decoration is not as old as an ordinary budget hotel, and the bathroom does not have a hair dryer socket. See you soon! The sound insulation is not good. There is a wall between the bathroom and the bed. The washing here is noisy, and the air conditioner is also noisy. Even if it is noisy, it does not heat up, so that when I wake up from the freeze, I think it is cooling...

Cost performance:
A very cost-effective family, 400 meters away from the subway station, very close to everywhere, within 3 kilometers from the Confucius Temple, although the hotel has been built for a long time, but after the interior is renovated, it is very ins style, plus the service is very OK, showing the time-honored brand quality!

breakfast:
Focus on breakfast! Mother fancy what she eats when she goes out, and the Sheraton’s breakfast is right in her arms!
Duck blood vermicelli soup, small wontons, boiled dried silk, plain noodles, quicksand buns, croissants, fruit and vegetable juice...all Chinese and Western dishes are available, all you can eat at once! Especially the cucumber juice in the fruit and vegetable juice is in line with my taste, it is recommended!

Room facilities:
The hotel is considered to be an old seniority, but the interior ins style decoration style is a bit trendy, very good, the facilities are also very new, electric curtains, smart mirrors... enjoy!

bed:
It’s for the mattress. Jin Ke’er’s mattress really doesn’t need to be questioned. I can’t sleep easily when I change the bed, so I don’t have to worry about it at Sheraton!

Health services:
The indoor hygiene is very clean, the carpets are also clean, the service is very good, and responsive.

msg:Sheraton has been one of Marriott's most popular lines in recent years. This has always been the case in Beijing and Hangzhou. This time, it really feels like it has reached a new height in Nanjing. It is mainly reflected in the service attitude of the front desk staff. Maybe because Sheraton has really pulled out the sky in the salary system, the service awareness and work enthusiasm of the service staff are basically a nigh**are. If you are lucky, you will encounter some not enough detailed guidance and Service, if you are unlucky, you will face a series of cynicism and inexplicable check-in experience, making you feel that it is better to live in a Han court, at least there is a psychological expectation that you will not be so angry.

If the hotel has a heart, it is recommended to put some recording pens or cameras at the front desk at a fixed time to see how your employees receive guests.

去辦入住時，前台無其他客人， 前台3-4人各自在忙自己的事，沒有人主動示意我可以辦理入住，拿了我的身份證後，還在處理其他事情， 最後我説了一句，能快一點行嗎？ 前台這麼多人 就我一個客人還這麼慢，才得以快速辦理好。 
酒店沒有停車庫，要停馬路對面，不太方便。 
退房時服務好，效率高。

特別是那個可傻的電梯。ab電梯和de不在一個電梯間。顯示b，我走過去然後他已經上來過關掉下去了。其他地方無顯示也沒有指示牌。很難發現。電梯到一層時候如果沒有標識幾樓根本搞不清楚！比如我就下2樓時下錯了到了4樓。還有一樓在裝修，極其不方便！不合適帶行李的！服務也比較隨意。可能因為在裝修的關係。早餐甚至沒有雞蛋檔！
