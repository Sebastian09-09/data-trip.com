Location is very convenient, the hotel is suited right on the walking  Zhongyang Street, close walk to the river bank of Sungari 
Very clean cozy rooms, friendly personnel 
If you are planning to visit Harbin this hotel can be definitely your choice

We feedback to the manager and she changed her attitude. But the experience was sort of tampered with because of that. They also have costumes below that you can wear around the lobby or even in your own room. Note that many costumes are not in good condition (Torn, Zipper not working). Overall the experience was still not too bad given its a historic hotel, and the elevator was cool.

msg:Very satisfied with the stay. I personally think it is the most worthwhile and best hotel in the Central Street business district. The location is excellent, in the middle of Central Street, about 20 meters away from the door is the Madiel Western Restaurant, and because it is on a small road perpendicular to the street, it is basically quiet with the windows closed. The whole building is magnificent. It was once the residence of the Grand Duke of Russia. There are gold foils on the walls, the room area is also large, and the toilet is smart. Although the building has a history of more than 100 years, it does not have the obvious problems of old buildings. The layout of the plugs is reasonable (I also stayed in the Madiel Hotel opposite, which is really too old and the facilities are not convenient). The hotel has many court-style costumes that can be changed for free for taking pictures. The restaurant downstairs in the hotel is also good. I went there for two meals and it was delicious and filling. The hotel service staff has a good attitude. I forgot a bag of things after leaving the hotel and took the initiative to call to inform me.

msg:A very good travel experience. The service is warm and the environment is elegant. The lady was given a room upgrade and a free lunch. There are also souvenirs. By the way, the free lunch and kvass are also good. The most interesting thing is the red sausage egg tart we added. The red sausage and sauerkraut are salty and very creative. There is no other place. It should be the original creation of the hotel restaurant. Although it is a free lunch, it is not perfunctory at all. The lamb chops are also very biu. It's awesome.

The hotel itself is an attraction. Not only does it carry history, but it is also very comfortable to live in after being renovated. The breakfast room is interesting and the ingredients are good.
In terms of service, it is the best in this trip to Northeast China. Several handsome guys and beautiful girls all have great specialties.
If you come to travel, it is highly recommended. Don't look at the bad decoration, the interior is great.

msg:I went to Harbin with my mother on May Day and booked a twin room. The experience was great!
First of all, it is very convenient to travel. On Central Street, every time you go out, you can get a Madier popsicle, visit the Hongzhuan morning market, buy Qiulin freshly brewed kvass, eat the old chef's pot-stuffed pork, check in the chimney ice cream, and go to Songhua Walking along the river is very close.
Let's talk about the hotel's service, which is warm and thoughtful. They carried boxes, delivered hot tea, and introduced the hotel facilities. The welcome fruit was delicious. If you need a call on WeChat, the response is very fast. When we were in a hurry to pack our luggage in the morning, we accidentally wet the gauze used to cover the wound. After asking on WeChat, the housekeeper soon sent clean gauze to the room, and we went to the airport without any delay.
Needless to say, the hotel looks great. There are oil paintings everywhere. In addition to the old elevator, there are also antique cabinets and large chandeliers that are very eye-catching. The soft furnishings in the room are also very gorgeous, which is very suitable for sisters who love to take pictures. My mother had so much fun that she canceled all her original itinerariesü§£
The facilities can be summed up in three words: They are all very goodüëç. The smart toilet and coffee machine are very high-end, the shower room is very waterproof and the water flow is stable.
Generally speaking, this hotel is the most impressive and the most aristocratic experience I have ever stayed in. It is well worth the experience.

It is quiet at night with only the sound of rain. I slept very well. Unfortunately, I fell ill with a fever after checking in and stayed in bed until the next day. I hurriedly went to Sophia Church and then caught a flight back to Beijing. I didn't even take a look around this century-old mansion, which was a bit regretful. In addition, for some reason, there are a lot of cars parked haphazardly on the street at the door, making it impossible for online taxis to get in. You need to drag your luggage and walk a short distance to the intersection to get on the bus. The road is obviously very wide. I hope these cars can be used in the future. Be of good quality.

Finally, let me talk about the service. It is really warm. Because there is no extra bed during the Spring Festival, but the small sofa can be used as a bed for the children. They immediately helped us make the bed. After checking out, they also gave us a small gift and helped us put the bed. The luggage was delivered to the car and the service was very attentive.

But after arriving, the service, hotel facilities, and environment were all very good. The twin room I booked had better beds. Before arriving, I was prepared for a family of three to squeeze into two 1.2 small beds. But the arranged room has a 1.8 or 2-meter large bed, plus a small bed, which is equivalent to changing from a twin room to a parent-child room. And it‚Äôs on such a popular day in the third grade of junior high school. However, I did not find this type of apar**ent on Ctrip. It may be a hidden apar**ent to surprise guests. Then the hotel has welcome fruits, the hygiene is very clean, the parent-child room has been changed, the toilet is large, and the dry and wet separation is very good.
The entrance of the hotel is inconspicuous, but as soon as you open the door and walk in, it is magnificent, resplendent and unique. The service is also very good. For breakfast, each person has a steak and an omelette. It is a Russian meal. As expected of a fighting nation, they eat a good breakfast.
When I finally left, I was given a beautiful souvenir. Very nice mirror and comb.

This time I booked the lowest price room for more than 1,400. I was taken to the back floor to check in by the waiter. The decoration of the room was OK.

After checking in, a waiter introduced the history of the hotel, saying that it was named after it was the residence of the Russian Grand Duke (this history cannot be found online, and there is no such explanation when it is called "Golden Hotel". The structure of this building is like It‚Äôs hard to imagine a hotel as a mansion); the oil paintings in the hotel are all works by famous artists.

Photoshooting in palace attire: A very good experience. We provide free photoshooting in palace attires. You can choose as you like. There is no time limit for taking photos. The clothes are a bit old, but the result is still very good.
Environment: From the lobby to the room, it is full of Russian aristocratic style. It is much better than the same modern decoration. The accommodation experience is also good, but the humidifier is a bit loud and cannot be turned on at night. The room is a bit dry
The last two photos are of the Russian restaurant downstairs, which tastes pretty good too.

It retains the Russian palace style and stayed in a marquis-style room, which felt good. The front desk and concierge service attitude was very good, and they took the initiative to introduce the history of the hotel. It's understandable that the facilities are a bit dated, as it is a protected building after all, but the bathrooms have been renovated and are already very good.

When I came to Harbin again this year, I chose the Grand Gongguan 1903 Hotel. When I checked in, a handsome guy with a very nice attitude saw me bringing an old man and two children with him, and he even offered to give us a breakfast. The feeling of staying here this time is still very good. The waiters will meet all our needs.

The hotel displays Russian oil paintings from various periods, ancient music boxes and various antiques that tell stories. There is a strong exotic a**osphere everywhere.
‚ñ™Ô∏èThe room follows the luxurious style of old Russia, with classic Russian aristocratic decoration style, and every detail is gorgeous, as if you have returned to the bustling Harbin metropolis of the last century.
üåüHotel features: Founded in 1903, it is a Russian-style aristocratic hotel with a long history, witnessing Harbin's century-old history. The hotel has one of only two century-old elevators in the country (the only one operating in the country). It was installed by Jews in the same year. It still uses iron gates and can provide safe operation for residents.

The front desk will explain the history of the building once, but at the same time, a wave of people who checked in made it clear that they had already heard it and they would continue to talk. At the same time, this disregard for the customer experience was also reflected in the check-out. Afterwards, I kept urging for good reviews. If it is really good, it will definitely be praised. However, it is very slow and annoying to urge five-star reviews one by one on WeChat and send screenshots to the group as if the customer is required to complete the task.

Facilities: European style. The building has history and the paintings hanging on the walls are also beautiful and said to be genuine ones bought in the Netherlands. But the decoration taste is a bit poor, it feels a bit like a nouveau riche country house. I can‚Äôt even take good-looking photos and send them out. The hair dryer is old-fashioned and takes a long time to blow. There is a coffee machine but the coffee is not good. The bathtub is quite nice.

Hygiene: The cleaning is very thorough and attentive, but I don‚Äôt know why there are always a few towels missing.

Environment: It is very convenient to go out to Central Street.

The century-old elevator experience of Russian aristocrats: Just like that, I sat for a while.

Breakfast: I must complain that it is not generally unpalatable! There are few choices and they all taste terrible. Even if I booked breakfast for three nights, I only ate once and gave up the other two times.

Taking photos in palace costumes: I have no experience, but there are many choices that should be good.

Good reviews
	
Attracted by the Russian style, I moved in with the intention of giving it a try. The experience was really good.
The hotel was originally the residence of a Russian Grand Duke in Harbin. After the war, the Grand Duke returned to China and the mansion was preserved and turned into a hotel, so it is full of Russian style.
The boy in the lobby was very polite. He served black tea, explained the history and collection of the hotel, sent it to the room, and left after giving some instructions. It was the first time I encountered such attentive hotel hospitality.
I booked a double bed room with a balcony and it felt very good (the room was too hot, so I went to the balcony to get some air [doge])
The slippers in the room are very comfortable (I like slippers [Shy R]); it is equipped with a capsule coffee machine, which is free to use; fruits are delivered every day; there is a bathtub, so you can take a bath and soak your feet if you get cold [Fire R]; number of TV channels Average but clear picture.
	
The hotel is right next to Central Street, and it is convenient to go to Sophia Church, Songhua River, and Laodaowai.
	
To sum up: I can stay here next time, it‚Äôs really nice [Applause R] [Like R]

msg:The hotel service is very good. The tall guy on the first floor of the lobby deserves praise for his considerate service. He introduced the cultural background and cultural relics of the hotel when we checked in. Every time we came in and out, he helped open and open the door with a smile and greeted us. When we left the hotel today, we took a taxi because The driver was stuck in traffic and couldn't get to the hotel entrance. The little brother helped carry our luggage all the way to the car. Thank you very much!

The guest room cleaning staff asked about the cleaning time, supplies were delivered in time, and a piece of fruit was given the next day.

The only drawback is that my friend who was staying with me arrived later than me due to a late flight. The hotel directly gave the room card to my friend in the early morning of that night without confirming and verifying the friend's information with me, which posed a certain security risk.

msg:When you come to Harbin, you always want to stay in the most unique hotel in the area. This time I chose Grand Mansion 1903 on Central Street, a hotel with a century-old building. The lobby is amazing! There are only two 120-year-old elevators in the country, here and at the Shanghai Waldorf Astoria Hotel. They were manufactured by the American Otis Company in 1900; the music box in the lobby is a disc-type music box produced in Germany in 1900. The golden part of the lobby is pasted with 85,000 pieces of gold leaf, and each chandelier weighs 300 kilograms, worth 350,000 yuan. All wardrobes in the room are customized by Qatar, a professional sleep bedding brand, and the bath is the British seven plus essential oil brand. We live in a Russian-style royal city view room, which is really exquisite, luxurious, and the details are in place! Fully automatic toilet, slippers with non-slip bottoms, coffee machine from Dolce & Cools, fruit delivered to the room, facing the street but very soundproof, not noisy at all... The service attitude is beyond praise, all the staff are warm, polite, meticulous and thoughtful! You can wear the dress for free, and it will be great to take pictures casually!
The only problem is the bath water. Because of the old building, the pipes cannot be modified. However, we were informed in advance that the water should be turned on for ten minutes before taking a bath. Although it was slightly inconvenient, it was understandable.

msg:As an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãexperience, we came to the 1903 Mansion Hotel, which is known as the oldest in Harbin.

Facilities: The hotel's internal facilities are relatively old. The bathtub has stains that have not been cleaned properly. The hot water facilities are not very good and it often takes a long time to put the water in before hot water comes out.
Hygiene: The hygiene aspect is remarkable. Although it is not spotless, it still achieves five-star standards in terms of environment.
Service: In terms of service, my partner and I were very satisfied with it at the beginning, but from the second day onwards, a series of requests came to the hotel like a tide. I was urged to give 4 positive reviews in a row in the morning, via WeChat and in person, as if I was experiencing it. I must give them good reviews for their hotel's service, and even when I was about to go to the hotel, they were urging me to leave a review and even asked me to finish the review before leaving. When did it become a guest's obligation to leave a review?
At this point, my experience is very uncomfortable, so I will give a big negative review in this area.

I am very grateful to the duty manager here, Manager Xiao, for making a complaint on 12345 for me, and in the end the citizen hotline punished the driver. Therefore, the service of this hotel makes people feel very safe and reliable.

As a high-end cross-border travel practitioner, I have high requirements for accommodation quality. This stay experience exceeded my expectations. The hotel is located in the center of Central Street. Most of the classics nearby are within walking distance. The lobby is magnificent and high-end. The interior of the room is also very luxurious and has very good details. Bathrooms and supplies are all high-end brands. Breakfast and steak are provided. If the hardware standards are high, the service is even more remarkable. The staff at the check-in point are very service-minded. They are very proactive in greeting luggage and carrying luggage. It was a very good check-in experience and I will choose it again.

msg:The third time I came to Harbin, this time I took my mother to play, I wanted to say that the accommodation has something special, so I chose 1903. Of course, there is an oolong in it, that is, as a leek, I mistakenly thought that 0713 stayed in this hotel in "Happy Restart", and it seemed wrong after checking in. After checking, I found out that Ma Die lived in their show Er üòÇ But it doesn't matter, I feel that this one is more gorgeous and refined.
*‚É£Ô∏èService: When checking in, the hotel staff gave a brief introduction, explaining the historical background of the hotel, and also provided WeChat 24-hour customer service. There were welcome fruits for both nights, and the overall attitude was very nice.
*‚É£Ô∏èFacilities: As a century-old hotel, the facilities are indeed not that smart. The staff also informed in advance that the hot water for bathing needs to be left for 3-5 minutes before it is hot enough. The sound insulation effect is average, but still within the acceptable range. Overall it is quite clean and comfortable.
*‚É£Ô∏èTraffic: Turn right when you go out of the hotel to Central Avenue, and there are many bus lines nearby. If you take a taxi, it is recommended to turn left and walk about 50 meters to Tongjiang Road, because there are too many cars parked on Dongfeng Street, and it is difficult to get in and out.
*‚É£Ô∏èDining: Because the hotel is right next to Central Street, there are many old-fashioned restaurants and new-style coffee shops to choose from, within a 300-meter walk. I especially recommend the Old Jewish Synagogue. I killed it there for two afternoons. It‚Äôs a good shot. Drink, there are not many people and it is quieter, and there are concerts at night that can be booked on the official account. In the morning, there is also a morning market on the nearby Hongzhuan Street. We didn‚Äôt know anything about it and wanted to go to have breakfast casually, but we were shocked by the crowds.

Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings: the soft facilities are not good. For a hotel that costs RMB 1,000 or more, I would default to a five-star hotel. I was careless. The toiletries are not from the brand, there are two shower gels and one conditioner, and the preparation is too careless; the face wipes are terrible, not as good as facial tissues; the worst is the toothbrush, not as good as the one from the Express Hotel, it can't be brushed just a few times. If it doesn't fall off anymore, it will fall off while brushing. I have to spit it all the time for fear of piercing my gums. Although the bedding is clean, the texture is very average. When I was leaving the store, the lady kept saying good reviews, but I didn't know whether it was acceptable or not. Chinese people don't like to speak out face to face because they want to save face. But how can we make progress if we don't point out the problems? I'm sorry. I don‚Äôt know how to sum it up, the price-performance ratio is average, the skin is good, but the flesh is not sweet.

It seamlessly connects classical and modern, perfectly integrates time travel and technology, and goes hand in hand with memory and transcendence.

The bed, sofa and screen inlaid with gold carvings in the room fully show the elegance and luxury of the princes and nobles in the 19th century. The most memorable ones are the authentic borscht, red cabbage soup, butter-fried mushrooms and pan-fried steak for breakfast. In the backyard of the coffee shop, there is a particularly quiet and unique place, surrounded by green shades, where you can sit quietly in the middle of the bustle, and drink Zen tea lightly. All troubles and fatigue will be swept away in this world, and the soul will be purified!

The cleaning was expedited and she let us check in early when there was a room available in 30 minutes. It was so considerate. The service staff are all kind and polite. It seems that the overall management of the hotel is in place! The front desk service staff also enthusiastically introduced the history and characteristics of the hotel to us, and showed the children the ancient music box. The next day, they took us to experience the century-old elevator. The adults and children were very happy. Every time they saw the staff , They all greeted each other with smiles and answered every question. Every time I go back to the room, the staff will lead me to the room. This kind of trea**ent cannot be achieved by other five-star hotels! The next day, there were two cleaning ladies who took the elevator. Seeing us coming, they immediately gave way. There were guests in the elevator and they didn't take the elevator together. Instead, they chose to wait for the next trip. I can feel the careful training of the leadership, and the service details are in place!

Let me talk about the hardware first. The waiter said that this was the home of a former Russian noble duke with a long history.

The entire lobby is made of 85,000 pieces of gold foil paper, which is handmade and resplendent! Except that the pipe design of the old house cannot be changed, and the hot water needs to be kept for a long time, other facilities are very modern.

The location of the hotel is superior, and the experience of taking the century-old elevator seems to have returned to the luxurious life of Russian nobles a hundred years ago. There is history everywhere in the hotel. Whether it is the front desk staff or the room attendants, they are very polite, bowing at 90¬∞, really like the Russian-style butler a hundred years ago, the hotel is really serious about service. Although it has a long history, the 100-year-old elevator runs without sound, and the central street is next to it, but the room is very quiet. A great stay experience!

The whole hotel is very distinctive, even the staff uniforms are Russian-style long skirts, the waiters enthusiastically took us to experience the only century-old elevator in the country, and listened to the wonderful music from a hundred years ago. I stayed in other hotels in Harbin before, and I came to Dagongguan 1903 Hotel after being introduced by friends. At first, I was quite skeptical and hesitant when I was introduced, but after I checked in, I was simply amazed. The decoration is resplendent and magnificent, and it feels like coming to a palace. The explanation says that gold foil paper is pasted little by little. The century-old elevator feels like I have traveled through time, the service is super good, the attitude of the service staff is friendly, and there is a dedicated butler service, I feel like the duchess of a hundred years ago haha. After going out at night, there are fruits and snacks in the room. The breakfast is also very good, the steak is delicious, it deserves a five-star praise! !

The most beautiful thing is time, whether in the past or now, the Grand Mansion in Harbin has always been a legendary symbol. Although the years have changed, the story of the hotel will never fade! The hotel has a 120-year-old music box. At the moment when the music record is remembered, it seems It tells the past and present of the Grand Mansion Hotel. When nostalgia becomes a common complex, retro becomes a new fashion in the modern city. The hotel is located on the bustling Central Avenue, deep in the downtown area, but rarely quiet. Watching people coming and going, there is a lot of traffic. The solid wood root-carved wooden doors of the Grand Mansion and the Gothic architectural style of the Baroque school are full of luxury! It makes people return to the modern era of the last century in a second! Being here, it seems to be experiencing a luxurious art practice. Before the return trip, I also experienced the Grand Duke‚Äôs family banquet with my girlfriends. The roast suckling pig is very authentic, and the side dishes are also very delicious.

The location is good, one minute walk to Central Street, but away from the hustle and bustle, it is very quiet, which ensures a rest for the whole family. 2. Unique. Today, hotels are homogeneous. It is very rare to transform an old house into a hotel. It is even better if it also highlights the Russian style. There are Russian noble clothes in the lobby that you can try on, and it is perfect with the hotel's classical decoration. 3. The service is good, from consulting to check-in, from experiencing the century-old elevator to experiencing clothing photoshoots, from breakfast to water delivery in the room, every communication is smooth, clean and friendly. In short, it is recommended to travel to Harbin.

Location
Just one step away from Dongfeng Street next to Zhongyang Street, it is quiet amidst the hustle and bustle. It is very close to Saint Sophia Church, Harbin Museum, flood control tower and Songhua River.

Facilities: The decoration is particularly luxurious, and you can really feel the feeling of Russian aristocrats. There is the only 100-year-old elevator that can still operate in the country, and the test ride experience is very smooth, as well as an old-fashioned music box.

Service: very satisfied. Every waiter in the hotel is very warm and thoughtful, from concierge service, to introducing the history of the hotel, facilities, and showing the room. I originally booked a deluxe garden double room in the annex building, but I was upgraded to a deluxe central city view double room in this building for free. The decoration is very beautiful.

The hotel's characteristic dress-up made me addicted. The photography is very good. The little sister and the little brother were also very patient in helping me change and return my clothes.

Breakfast is a semi-buffet style, one steak omelette per person, and the rest is self-service. The variety is not too much, and the quality is not bad.

It is recommended to live here when traveling in Harbin.

After leaving the store, the front desk found that the child's shoes were left in the corner. They contacted us immediately. Fortunately, the trip was not delayed. Thank you store.

After entering the door, there will be a lady in a Russian dress to help with the luggage, and honey lemon tea will be served when you check in. There is unlimited steak for breakfast, and the other buffet dishes are slightly less, but they can still be full. Because it is a historical building, the government does not allow random renovations, so it may be a bit inconvenient during the stay. For example, it takes a long time to get hot water, and the heating control switch of the room is on the ceiling.

You can also experience the centuries-old elevator inside. The children went to sit for a while, which is very novel. It was a family outing, and the room type was finally upgraded. The staff arranged a room opposite the door, which was quiet and convenient.
The hotel is in the middle of Central Street, walking distance to the riverside and Saint Sophia Church, the location is excellent.
Next time I come to Harbin, I will still want to stay here. I highly recommend it!

In addition, the hotel used to be the mansion of the Grand Duke of Russia, the rooms are clean and tidy, and the accommodation is luxurious and comfortable. It is dozens of times better than the fake five-star hotel I stayed in before. In addition, the service attitude of the front desk staff is very good. The staff are wearing palace costumes and enthusiastically explaining the history of the hotel. They also let our family try the elevator and phonograph that were more than a hundred years ago. I have to say that the performance is better than the current ones. The most important thing is to help us carry three luggage with a total of 120 catties, and we didn't leave until we got on the bus. I was really touched at that moment! Finally, the breakfast is very good, with many varieties, and you can eat steak for free. You always ask us if it is enough, very generous. This hotel will be our family's first choice in the future.

msg:One of the worst experiences in recent years. Apart from the good location, everything else is a complete mess. I don‚Äôt understand how the high ratings on the Internet come from.
The price is higher than the Shangri-La Marriott Fiat. The facilities and services are not up to par with the domestic average of three-stars. I don‚Äôt know how to get this five-star rating.
Let‚Äôs talk about the hardware first. A large piece of wall peeled off at the door of the given room. The toilet couldn‚Äôt be flushed. It had to be flushed two or three times before it could be flushed. The passage to the room was complicated with twists and turns but the fire signs were unclear (already prepared to report to Harbin Fire Depar**ent).
Besides, the service is really the funniest in a hotel I've ever stayed in. If I ask any questions, I'll sell myself on the hotel's consumption. If I have any doubts about the location and facilities of the room, I'll immediately sell them and pay for an upgrade. Ask the front desk for a good nearby restaurant and tell us that the hotel's hungry meal is nearby. The best thing is, I don‚Äôt know how I have the nerve to say it. If I ask for other information, I won‚Äôt know anything about it.
I originally booked two days and stayed for one day, so I hurriedly left.
I didn‚Äôt plan to write a negative review at first. I‚Äôll try to trick whoever I want. The hotel staff called and sent messages asking for a five-star review. I really don‚Äôt know how much pressure the boss put on me to do such a limitless thing.
It ruined a historical building, failed to live up to the culture behind it, and tarnished the image of Harbin. That‚Äôs what I think.

There are also elevators and phonographs from a hundred years ago in the lobby, which is really very impressive.

However, the breakfast service is not very good. I waited for a long time at the seat and finished the self-collected meals. I didn‚Äôt even give me the steak and fried eggs.

Living here can enjoy the richness of history and modern convenience at the same time, and the value for money is excellent. The breakfast is also very rich, and every guest has a steak. The Russian costume in the lobby can be worn back to the room to take pictures. And the famous century-old elevator is also very good. Living here is like living in a museum plus a small palace. The central street is just outside the door, and it is very convenient to travel.

The only downside is the room card, which can only be used the next day. We have arrangements for the next morning, so Has little effect. When you go out, turn right and you will arrive at Central Avenue, which is very convenient for shopping. After checking out, I gave the child a figure. The child likes it very much. I didn‚Äôt get on the elevator that I thought about. Wait until next time

msg:The Grand Mansion, built in 1903, shows the luxury of old Russian Guizhou everywhere. The hotel is smaller than expected, and the others are basically the same as imagined. While waiting for check-in, you can visit this historic hotel first. The old elevator in the lobby should be regarded as a treasure of his family, and I am very fortunate to experience this century-old elevator. It is said that the only other elevator in China is in Shanghai, but tourists are no longer allowed to experience it. There are also all kinds of antiques in the hall. There is one of the oldest gramophones, which can play music by making small holes in the metal plate. It can still be played today, and I was fortunate enough to listen to it, which is quite admirable. Russian purple candies are placed in the hall and in the room, and the fleece nightgown in the closet also makes me feel quite unique. Other features in the room are also very distinctive. Live here to enjoy the history of Harbin, hovering between history and reality, can't help but feel excited!

The appearance of the building was nothing like that. I almost thought the driver had gone to the wrong place! The price is on the high-end route, but there is no one to help you with your luggage at the door. The small lobby is painted with splendor and splendor. I have just found a sense of it. The room for more than 2,000 per night is really speechless. It is not the main building, it is probably The old house behind the old hotel was renovated. The window of the room on the second floor is actually in the corridor of the escalator connecting the two buildings. The hair dryer is broken and the shower head must be held in hand to use it. Âõßüòì You need to ask for it when checking out. Let a hotel with good reviews have its own problems! I suggest that if you have a budget of 2,000, just go into the store and have a look.

msg:The hotel I stayed in yesterday is a building with a history of 120 years - "Harbin Grand Mansion 1903 Hotel". Mrs. Wang has been paying attention to him for two years, and finally got her wish. The location of the hotel is excellent, only a few steps away from the central street, but because it is not on the main road, it is quiet in the middle of the noise, it can be said to be hidden in the city. Although the building is old, the luxurious interior is consistent with its predecessor, the Russian duke's residence, but the facilities are still fashionable, and the girls are dressed in court costumes to provide us with the warmest service. The Russian restaurant here is also worth tasting. Because I am old and my stomach is not strong enough, I only order some snacks. These are also remarkable, especially the egg tarts, which are stuffed with Harbin red sausage and sauerkraut. The taste is really good ,Worth a try.
        At noon, we went out and walked along the central street to the river, walking and shopping, there were many pedestrians on the street, walking in the shade of the sugar maple tree, it was cool and very comfortable, and the bread bricks under the tree It is bright and uneven, telling the history of Harbin City. There are row upon row of shops on both sides of the street, and the explanatory signs on the old buildings make everyone stop and look. Almost everyone who comes to Harbin will go to Central Street. If time permits and is physically strong, you can feel the different flavors of Central Street from early morning to late at night. You can also walk to the Sophia Cathedral from the hotel. The old elevator in the hotel is worth taking.

After walking around, the room has not been tidied up yet. They promised to upgrade us to a room, but one of the rooms they gave us had no windows. The other room was even more outrageous.

msg:I came here to make a bad review of this hotel. The sound insulation effect is terrible! The normal voice of the next room can be heard clearly, and at 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, I can be woken up by the short voice of the guest reviewer next door. And there is no privacy at all. I believe that the voice of our room will be heard by other rooms. The guest next door woke up at 5:30 in the morning and began to wash. The sound insulation effect was so poor that it seemed to be washing in my room, which woke me up directly. The hotel's handling of this problem was also very perfunctory. After a while, I was asked to pack my luggage and change rooms at 1 o'clock in the middle of the night, and said that the manager could give me a satisfactory solution the next day. As a result, the next day the manager said that he had asked me to change the room the day before, but I didn't want to. How can I know that the guest next door wakes up at 5:30 in the morning? Moreover, the sound insulation of the hotel is so poor. The customer service staff at the reception in the early morning and midnight said that the hotel had this problem. When the manager came the next day, he said that no guest had ever complained about it, which was full of lies. I asked the hotel to refund the fee, but the hotel firmly disagreed, and could only let me stay for another day at a discounted price. With such poor sound insulation, how dare I live again? Where is the satisfactory trea**ent as agreed?
In addition to the poor sound insulation, there is also a strange smell. The hotel said it was because of the century-old house. OK, then I will endure it. But what about the lingering cookies left by previous guests on the carpet? Could it be left over a hundred years ago? Moreover, the hotel is right in the middle of a bunch of old-fashioned residential buildings. It is seriously suspected that the auxiliary building is an old-fashioned residential building. The room is on the first floor, the decoration is average, and there is no view at all. Maybe it was the servant's room a hundred years ago. I spent 1,000 yuan to live in the servant's room. It's really ****
There is no privacy in such a hotel, and the sanitation is worrying. I suggest that everyone consider it carefully. I will never spend 1,000 yuan to live there again. By the way, the Habsburg Hotel, which is 10 minutes away from Central Street, is much better. It is a 5-star hotel with a river view. The whole hotel is delicious, the service is like home, and the price is also very favorable

üìçLocation: The location of the hotel is very good, it really does it [downstairs is the Central Street]! üòä And it is very close to various places, less than 20 minutes to Ha Station.
üîîService: The service of the hotel is perfect, and the attitude of the little brothers and sisters is very good. After checking in, the lady patiently explained the history of the hotel to us and introduced the various collections of the hotel owner. Although there is no robot in the hotel, if there is a request, the staff will help deliver the meal upstairs, which is hard work. Thanks to the front desk for helping us upgrade the room, which has added a touch of beauty to our trip these days.
üçÉEnvironment: I'm not good at expressing, just look at the pictures for the environment, the reality is more beautiful than the pictures! When you come to Harbin, you must come and experience this Russian-style aristocratic hotel. This retro experience is unmatched by chain 5‚≠ê hotels.
üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThe facilities in the room are all available. Coffee machine, coffee powder, small refrigerator, electric toilet, bathtub and iron are all equipped. TV is a double-sided TV, the only fly in the oin**ent is that it cannot be projected.
‚ò∫Ô∏èThe hotel also provides costume props to take pictures. There is a fitting room on the first floor, which is very intimate. I wish you all great photos.
In addition, the century-old elevator is also worth a try! ! There are only two left in China.
The Russian purple candy presented in the wine list is also super delicious hahaha.
Finally: Welcome everyone to stay in this hotel, you will not be disappointed~üòÅüòÅ

msg:It‚Äôs not quite up to the 4.9 rating, to be honest, it‚Äôs a more fair and objective evaluation. As a serious travel enthusiast, I have stayed in many historical and cultural hotels, but 1903 is indeed the least satisfactory. Maybe my expectations for it were too high.
Let me talk about the good things first. First of all, the location is good. You can go out to Central Street. The hotel itself is a historical relic building, and the decoration inside is very Russian retro. Most of the employees there are friendly.

But these still can't save me from my disappoin**ent with it. I paid a room rate that was more expensive than the Ritz-Carlton, but I couldn't get a room with a bathtub. I told the check-in guy that I had to pay extra for a bathtub, but there were obviously many rooms available. It's really incomparable to a group five-star hotel. Upgrading a room is a basic operation, especially when I made my request clear. Therefore, if you want a free room upgrade, I suggest you choose a five-star hotel from an established European and American group.
It was Chris**as Eve, so it was really disappointing.
The sound insulation effect is very poor. After changing rooms once, it is still very poor. When I reported it to the front desk, they did not follow up. The implication is that they have changed rooms once and have to endure no matter how noisy they are. There is a lack of real care.
There was no hot water the next day. I turned it on for nearly 20 minutes and there was still no hot water. I really shivered when I took a shower in winter.
Then, the breakfast in the hotel is really pitiful with few varieties, and they are all salty. It is really not even as good as a three-star. I don‚Äôt know if it is due to the epidemic or it is just this level as usual, but the breakfast charge is really not low, and it is not very good. It is recommended to book a room with breakfast, it is really very cost-effective.
No swimming pool, no gym. The black garbage bag after cleaning was placed directly at the door of the room. All the details were terrible.

Finally, I would like to say that instead of asking for good reviews after checking out, it is better to really strengthen the hotel's soft power and real service awareness. Asking for positive reviews and ranking high will only disappoint more customers who come here to visit. Because in the end, the only way to get good reviews from customers is to feel the true care of employees, rather than superficial fake politeness.
And this has nothing to do with the shortage of staff due to the epidemic, because that‚Äôs all the employees on duty.

If you really want to experience the historical architecture, then staying for one night is enough, otherwise the price and rating are really not worthy of the name. I rarely give neutral reviews. I hope the hotel can improve to prevent good heritage hotels from falling into disrepair.

The introduction of the hotel in Ctrip is seriously inconsistent. No valet parking! Even the front desk staff can't even drive. Finding a parking space is a nigh**are. The hotel is just a renovation of an old building, and the room type depends on luck. We lived on the fourth floor, the elevator went to the third floor, and then we walked down the stairs with our luggage, and it was said to be the fourth floor. There is a gap between the room size and Ctrip's description, the ventilation is not smooth, and the air conditioning is almost negligible. Originally booked for two nights, but I was really uncomfortable, so I checked out early and changed hotels. After leaving the hotel, the hotel has been very polite to give five-star praise. After hesitating for a long time, I decided to give an honest review, hoping to help the guests in the future.

According to the manager's introduction, all the structure of the hotel is not allowed to be changed, only the decoration and function can be modified, so the parent-child room that we live in feels a little small for the three adults and one child, but the toilet is super large. This trip also brought an exotic a**osphere to our trip because of the characteristics of the hotel, and it is recommended to stay. By the way, the location is not too great.

msg:The best hotel in the whole Northeast trip üòä
The location of the hotel is very good, next to the central street, it is very convenient to visit.
The hotel facilities are also very good. It is easy for southerners to go to the north and cannot adapt to the heating, which will affect sleep. However, the heating facilities in this hotel are very comfortable and will not feel stuffy. There are air conditioning and additional small electric heaters. The mattress is also comfortable and can fully guarantee sleep. The century-old elevator runs very quietly and smoothly, which is amazing, and the sound quality of the old music box is also very good.
Not to mention the service of the hotel, the staff are very considerate and polite, the little kumquat tea at the door will drive away the exhaustion of the plane, the daily communication and transportation are very friendly and sincere, I like this a**osphere üòä.

The Mansion Hotel 1903, located on the Central Street in the center of Harbin, is my ideal place to travel. The whole hotel is like a museum of Russian aristocrats. Riding on the antique elevator that has been in operation for a century is another experience of this trip. Needless to say, it's so convenient. The key is that the front desk service is very good, and the young lady patiently led the hotel tour and explained. One suggestion is that the room is too hot. It would be better if you can control the temperature yourself.

In addition, the hot water took five minutes to come out, which greatly affects the experience. As the most expensive hotel on Central Street, compared to The nearby Walter and Habsburg seem to be very cost-effective.
Service: The service itself is at the level of a B&B and is not well standardized. There have been cases where the waiter entered the room door to deliver the fruit plate without permission. Of course, the service staff actively helped introduce the elevator, etc., which is worthy of recognition.
suggestion:
(1) Hope to improve the hot water system as soon as possible.
(2) If it cannot be improved, reduce the price by 1/3 and lower expectations. And objectively inform us of possible problems with hot water when checking in. It is recommended that you inform us objectively after experiencing the century-old elevator and music box to manage expectations in advance.
(3) I hope that the hotel as a whole will not put too much energy into urging good reviews. If all services are for an OTA evaluation, the OTA evaluation will soon lose value, and the hotel will not focus on it. On the improvement of software and hardware services.

msg:If you want to experience Russian style, you can come and stay here. The hotel is in a very good location, surrounded by scenic spots. However, the facilities are indeed relatively old. The bath water must be left for ten minutes before hot water is available. The room is very small. In addition, there are many charging items, so please be cautious.
