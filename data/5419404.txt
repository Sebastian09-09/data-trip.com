We're given a free upgrade which was nice. Food was great, worth to be called a 5 star quality; be it the breakfast buffet or room service (big serving portions). It was not very crowded when we were there which is good. Our kids love the slides, paddle board, animals by the kids club, and the new addition this year...the bubble bath. We stayed here summer last year too and we felt the service and everything has improved. Beds are comfy and cleanliness is on point too. There is also a small snack shop which was convenient; however, the jackfruit we bought there was not very good.

I have amenities a 4/5 because the slides are lovely but no water runs down them and they are not slippery. And the cool bridge over the pool  apparently had one broken rope, why not fix it?
Overall, if your are looking for a place away from the crowds with a wild surfing beach and super friendly service, I would stay here. We will definitely return, thank you for everythingüòä

msg:-Marriott Sinofication- 
This hotel was a well designed investment. Apparently local management is not able to run it as a Marriott. 
We had booked a two bedrooms suite with sea view. 
Parking: very limited outside the hotel‚Äôs lobby blocking even the pavement and pathways in and out of the venue: positions were ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù by the management on the pavement! 
Check-in: we arrived after a long morning drive at 13:45 - room was not ready and we were suggested to have lunch at the hotels all day dine restaurant. 45min later we were told that room was not ready. We did not check-in before 15:50! (2hrs delay)
Asking for the hotel‚Äôs general manager took the reception team 30min to decide if they would like to inform him‚Ä¶ finally he appeared but it was obvious after talking to him that this a ‚Äústandard hotel feature‚Äù. Anyway, we could see that we were not the only ones with frustration‚Ä¶
Room: the suite was very good itself, but in terms of cleanliness it was rather poor. Maintenance is obviously not taking place with a plan but totally ad-hoc. Bathroom amenities and bedding quality were of Marriott standard but still not clean!
Breakfast: tables capacity is limited during peak hours (08:30 to 10:00) so they have opened next venue to support the process, however still the capacity is not enough and in case you end to the second room the buffet is limited, so you need to walk to the main restaurant to get more options. The team cannot run the breakfast - cleaning and preparing tables is rather slow and of poor quality; there was no single morning that we did not have to ask for knives and forks (chopsticks were available however). 
Restaurants (a la cart dine in): service very poor. The plates come one after the other with 10min gap. Salad came last and for one club sandwich my young daughter had to wait at least 50min‚Ä¶
Facilities - pools and external spaces: well designed but very poorly maintained - beautiful venues like an external bar next to the pool or a bar inside the pool are not run and are shut down. Rather disappointing that the management cannot take advantage of their beautiful facilities. Instead a couple of external partner just next to the seaside inside the hotel‚Äôs grounds are running their small operations rather successfully I would think (every single evening we had drinks and snacks at these establishments).
This is a fairly new hotel (around five years), but looks already old. Management needs to take actions. 
The disappointing part is that the team cannot understand how poorly they perform! It is obvious that they lack training and that turnover of people is high and frequent. 
I should mention Alain here who was really trying hard to support he was literally everywhere at the lounge, at the restaurant and would listen, but Alain is just one person. Operations like these need a strong team and not just capable  individuals. 
A Marriott hotel has been changed to a local Chinese hotel . No need to spend the extra money for a Marriott! Just book a local hotel in the area. Service and management will be better‚Ä¶
Nice place and beautiful facilities not enough!

msg:Please don‚Äôt get me wrong; I‚Äôm sure there are customers that would find this place brilliant. In our case however, being a young non-Chinese couple without children, I would not come here again. 

We usually go for American or European hotel chains in China to have a certain quality standard and to avoid cultural misunderstandings. At this place unfortunately we could not avoid them which is exhausting if you‚Äôre just looking for a place to decompress and relax. 

First impression arriving late at night, the desk personnel didn‚Äôt know a word of English. Ok not a big deal - nevertheless annoying at Marriott group, right? Anyway. 
Breakfast: loud annoying music, cheap coffee out of an old machine. Poached eggs ordered - sunny side up arrive at the table completely soaked in grease and oil. 
Dinner: vegetarian dish ordered (as described in the menu) - dish arrives full with chunks of cheap meat. 
Wanna go for a swim? Yelling guardians run towards you blocking you from swimming, reminding you that it‚Äôs forbidden because swimming is dangerous. You are therefore being advices to use the pool which is not deep, not long and where loud techno music drives you crazy. And so on and so on. It just gets exhausting over time.

The hotel clearly aims for Chinese families. There is a little water park, supermarkets, a go cart area and other amenities which is nice. However we didn‚Äôt really feel welcomed at this place. Not by the staff nor by other hotel guests. We were the outsiders.

Now to the good bits: the place is located in an interesting area. Perfume bay is great because it‚Äôs close to Wanning in the north and Clearwater bay and Haitang bay in the south. In perfume bay there isn‚Äôt much but a Main Street with a night market, local restaurants and lots of shops selling fresh fruits and coconuts. We had our road bikes with us and went for lots of tours exploring the island here. The routes from there towards the island or up and down the coast are great! 
Our room was relatively old but clean. Worth mentioning is the gym. Beautifully equipped with everything you need and with a stunning view overlooking the bay and the mountains! Great Maui-feeling! :) 

This hotel a budget friendly alternative for some days. Staying longer or looking for western standard I‚Äôd rather recommend the Marriott hotels in Yalong or Haitang bay.

Because the price dropped, although it was a little more expensive than usual, the front desk helped to upgrade the room, and it was also very satisfying.

msg:The second stop in Hainan. I went to Yalong Bay Hilton before, which has its own merits, but in short, it is a good experience. Children like to play in the water. There are many swimming pools in Yalong Bay, and the staff next to it are very responsible. There is a guard every three steps and a sentry every five steps to remind parents to take good care of their children. Bath towels and mineral water are very convenient. The advantage of the Marriott in Xiangshui Bay is that there are fewer people. The infinity pool by the sea feels good, and there is a children's water fortress for children to play happily. The beach is much better than Yalong Bay, it is gentle and delicate, and the crab catching activity at night is so fun. A group of children are so high. It's a pity that the sea water in April is still a little cold, and the children refused to go snorkeling and surfing.
The service is very good, free extra bed and upgraded us to a sea view room-the unobstructed sea view from the floor-to-ceiling window on the fifth floor is really beautiful. The housekeeper Xiao Wang is responsive, considerate and enthusiastic. From adding water to helping the elderly open the door, he helped us a lot.
The only drawback is that there is not enough space for drying clothes on the balcony-the children go to the water twice a day and catch the sea, so they really need enough clothes drying racks...

msg:The room layout is reasonable and the hygiene is OK. Xiao Cai added green bubbles when checking in and provided some tips for eating, drinking and playing around. The service response was very timely. I think the price and service are OK in the off-season. I won't comment on it in the peak season.

Facilities: The room does not feel old and damp as mentioned in the comments. It may be because of the weather. There is a children's fence. The swimming pool and the beach are connected downstairs. Children like it more.

Hygiene: OK. The room aunt responded promptly. I went out to notify the aunt to clean before breakfast. When I came back, it was already cleaned.

The only complaint is that the breakfast is really not delicious. There are few varieties. The hot dishes are few and oily. The semi-finished steamed buns and steamed buns are OK. The eggs are OK. The others are really not delicious.

The five-point praise is for the handsome Xiao Cai. The restaurant can be improved.

msg:Facilities: Being close to the sea is the biggest advantage.
Service: I stayed in this place for two nights after Qingming Festival. The service is almost non-existent, especially for Wanning hotels.
Environment: I really love the sea. The hotel is only a 2-minute walk away from the beach. Especially during off-peak hours, there are even fewer people on the beach. You can enjoy the sea breeze and listen to the waves.
You need to walk 2 kilometers to eat in the surrounding area. There are no bicycles or electric vehicles to rent in the hotel, so it is not very friendly for people who travel alone and want to go out for dinner. However, there are relatively few people in Xiangshui Bay. If you choose to stay in this hotel, you have to accept other not-so-good places.

msg:I decided to bring my kids to Lingshui on a last-minute basis. Marriott is great.
The overall service is very online. Justin at the front desk is a very nice guy. He was upgraded to a deluxe sea view room on the 5th floor. The sea view is very beautiful. Seeing that we had children with us, we added a small child's bed to the double bed room.
Perhaps because of the off-season, children's breakfast was provided for two days.
The middle son reported that the bed was a bit hard, so we were given an extra mattress.
The hotel is about 25 minutes away from Boundary Island, and more than 40 minutes away from Monkey Island and Daidai Island.
Justin also recommended delicious seafood food stalls in the surrounding area, and there were basically no mistakes. It's more delicious and more affordable than Sanya. The key is freshness. I ate it three times in a row. I have been to Sanya many times, and this time the Lingshui route was the most enjoyable and comfortable self-driving trip. If my son didn‚Äôt like to make a lot of noise, I would have really wanted to stay here for a few more days.

Service: Very good. Although it was late when I checked in, any needs were responded to immediately and the staff were also very enthusiastic.
Dining: I only experienced breakfast and afternoon tea, which were quite satisfactory. Breakfast had Lingshui's characteristic sour noodles, which you can try.
Environment: The decoration is in the resort style of Southeast Asia. The room is large, the view of the sea view room is also very good, and the sound insulation is very good, which is very suitable for vacation. There is no problem with hygiene.

There are no shortcomings in all aspects. It deserves five stars. I will definitely choose to stay in Marriott next time I go to play

The room phone service was also cold, and there was nothing to ask. I asked them to get some detergent for the children to wash the dishes, but they said that it was only in the kitchen and they didn't have it. Such a big hotel, the kitchen and the guest room are separate companies and cannot share materials? ? The breakfast was also unpalatable, and the guy who cooked noodles looked like he hadn't woken up yet, and was still cold. . It's not that you have to be enthusiastic, but at least you have to be polite and provide good service. After all, the room fee is 1000+. It's not easy to find bad watermelons in Sanya, and the breakfast here is all tasteless. The Balabala room is also very low.... The few scattered toys are also messy. I once suspected it was a fake Marriott. . This is my first review and rating. Help everyone avoid thunder!

msg:I went all the way north to Xiangshui Bay, and I didn't expect to find such a treasure hotel, which brought me a completely relaxing and immersive vacation experience for 3 days. 
- I played in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay for more than 10 days before. There were too many people and I was a bit impetuous and couldn't relax quietly. The price was not cheap. 

[Room]
Not much to say, Marriott standard, the room is also quite large. 

[Swimming pool]
It's great. If you like swimming, there is a rectangular 28-meter-long swimming pool close to the seaside. You can take a video and check it out. If you bring your children, there is a children's swimming pool and a slightly higher slide. It's very powerful for the hotel. 

[The hotel enjoys a private beach]
There are few people and it is quiet. It is extremely suitable for lying down. It is very comfortable (much quieter than Yalong Haitang Qingshui Wanning). You can sit for a while. The beach is open all day long, and you won‚Äôt feel restless

[Waves]
It‚Äôs slightly larger and suitable for surfing. There are many people surfing. It‚Äôs quite comfortable to lie down and watch them perform. Hehe
It feels great to lie down and listen to the sound of the waves and fall asleep

[Food]
There are a lot of Chinese and Western food

[Value for money]
Hainan is the most cost-effective place to stay so far

[Surroundings]
Along the popular highway next to Xiangshui Bay, it‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs more beautiful than the highway in Yalong Bay, and there are fewer people and it‚Äôs not so restless. You can walk on the extended beach and take great photos. The key is that there are fewer people and it‚Äôs comfortable
There is a yacht club to the north. It was windy and difficult to go out to sea during the few days I stayed there.
There is also a lighthouse and a large beach to the north. The sand is fine and soft, the wind and waves are strong, and there are few people. It‚Äôs super photogenic to take pictures

In terms of facilities, the glass of the independent toilet room and independent shower room is very transparent. When you are using the toilet or taking a bath, it is okay if your partner comes in. But would it be awkward if your child, a teenager, comes in? There are quite a few swimming pools in the hotel, divided into those for children (0.4 meters high) and swimming pools for adults. The breakfast is quite satisfactory. I came by tram. There are GAC Energy charging piles on the ground next to the hotel, but they are occupied by more gas trucks. Regarding the location, the people at Marriott are quite helpless, but their underground parking lot has a 7kwh slow charger, which is enough for one night. The price is 1.60 yuan per unit, which is still acceptable!

The housekeeper Nicole was particularly responsible. She took the initiative to call in the morning to discuss check-in related matters, and the arrangements were very good.
The view is great, suitable for surfing. The hotel's swimming pool is very well maintained and clean, and the breakfast is very comfortable.

Service: The hotel's service is still very good, the attitude is very good, and the people are very professional

Entertainment: The main reason why I decided to book here is because of the entertainment facilities. The kids couldn't get enough of the water park for two days, and the water quality was very clean. I stayed in February and the water was actually a bit cold, but I still couldn't resist the temptation.
  ÔøºThe indoor children's playground is relatively average. Small area. Nothing but ocean balls and a simple slide

Children's activities: Generally speaking, they are OK. Remember to make an appoin**ent in advance, preferably before you check in.

Travel photography: The hotel provides five free photos and a 15-second short video. This is a plus, there is no promotion or anything like that.

Going downstairs is the beach, which is super close. The sea water is really glassy and the waves are a bit big, suitable for surfing. It has a different experience from the beach on Dadonghai. It is also very convenient to take a taxi from the hotel. The hotel service is excellent. The hotel staff, from the manager to the cleaning staff, will smile and say hello. Especially Justin, the front desk clerk, arranged a small bed for our big bed room (the twin room with two children was not booked). The room faced the sea and had an unobstructed view, which was great! Luggage will be delivered to the room for help, and fruit will be delivered to the room. The children in the pool downstairs have a lot of fun. It's a very good experience!

Environment: One side faces the sea and the other side faces the yacht dock, so you can see the water from both sides without overlooking the garden view. Although the sand is not as fine as Clear Water Bay, the hotel's own beach is very close.
There are toys or various check-in and ticket transparent boats near the swimming pool, inflatable swimming rings, etc. (for a fee). There are also bath towels that you can register and collect after swimming, so you don‚Äôt need to bring your own in the room.
The room has floor-to-ceiling windows, a cloakroom, a sofa, and children's toiletries are also provided.
There are not many people in Xiangshui Bay, so there is no need to crowd around. Although there are not as many places to eat nearby as in Clear Water Bay, there are grains, vinegar, etc. not far away. The wine package for a 2-night stay is still very cost-effective.

1. I told them in advance that there were children and elderly people, and said they would prepare children's toiletries, but in fact they didn't. I was reminded later that they would be delivered the next day.
2. The beach in front of the hotel is too dirty, and it‚Äôs not a big area. I hope it can be dealt with, but I can‚Äôt get there.

From the moment we entered the hotel to check-in, Cai Cai at the front desk added WeChat. All subsequent needs and questions were responded to and solved in a timely manner. It was a very good service experience. The elderly and children are well taken care of. I borrowed a wheelchair, and one of the rooms was upgraded to a sea view room, and twin beds could be combined into a king bed. It is recommended to increase the hotel's barrier-free access. It is still a bit difficult to push wheelchairs and strollers from the room to the beach. There were boats leaving the harbor in the early morning, and the sound and smell were a bit loud. The Chinese restaurant has good food. I ate in the hotel throughout the meal and the set meal was very affordable.

Kenny, the butler who received us, was very welcoming and arranged a very comfortable room for us. The service staff in the restaurant are very attentive. The children asked for chocolate sauce for breakfast on the first day, and the chef took the initiative to ask if he wanted more on the second day. He was able to remember the customer's needs just by meeting each other, which was very surprising.
I didn‚Äôt know this was a surfing resort before I came here. I watched the surfing performances of many masters at close range, which was very shocking!
I was very satisfied with the goods received from the night crab catching activity. When I released the crabs early in the morning, I even caught a crab blinking its eyes, which made my daughter and I laugh!
Great stay experience!

The room was clean and tidy, the bedding was exquisite, and it was so comfortable that I didn‚Äôt want to leave after I checked in! The large swimming pool outside is very clean, and the private beach is beautiful! Every staff member living here is very friendly and polite, especially Nancy He, Justin Cai, and Mary Xiaoying at the front desk, who have a warm service attitude and answer every question! It‚Äôs really the best choice when visiting Lingshui R&F Bay and Xiangshui Bay! Will live here next time!

Deduct one point for sanitation‚Äîthe sanitation of the breakfast restaurant is poor, and the flies in the dessert area exceed the standard. Suggest improvement

I originally booked a HNA double bed room in the north building. Today, I am fortunate to be able to upgrade to a sea view room in the south building. Thank you very much. The room is clean and has a good view. Sitting on the balcony, you can watch the sea, listen to the waves, see the lighthouse, and enjoy the sunrise. It takes 2.3 minutes to walk to the beach. There is a children's water park and swimming pool downstairs. Whether you are a couple who want to come to Perfume Bay to relax, or take your children for a trip, this hotel is a good choice!

msg:The first time I stayed in a hotel, I booked three days and left early. The environment is pretty good, but I don‚Äôt know where I get the confidence to write about a family hotel. The room is equipped with two bathrobes, one large and one small. If you ask me to get an extra bathrobe, there are only two bathrobes in a room. By default, the hotel only has single-parent families? Then the level of cleaning is really unflattering and can only be described as careless. The most annoying thing is the hotel swimming pool. In a family hotel, you can give me a frosted bottom swimming pool? The child's feet were covered in blood blisters after playing all afternoon, and it hurt to walk! The service level is also the same. I helped the child deal with the injured area in the room. I complained about the swimming pool to the service staff who took the band-aid and said that I wanted to complain. At first, the other person thought that the injury was in the room and seemed a little nervous. Later I heard that it was the swimming pool. Her expression changed in an instant, maybe it was not within her scope of responsibility, so she left a message and left quietly. The same thing happened when I finally communicated with the hotel about check-out. The attitude was to leave as soon as I wanted. From the beginning to the end, there was not even a single word of apology or concern for the children's situation. I feel uncomfortable after taking a good vacation. Sorry to bother you. It was my fault for choosing this hotel. I will change it.

He patiently answered many of our questions and showed us a room we plan to live in. He is very representative of the professionalism and service standards that Marriott Hotels should have, so we did not hesitate Choose Marriott. When we checked in, we happened to meet him again. He saw us dragging our luggage to the front desk in embarrassment. He kindly upgraded our room for us. Since the twin room was gone, he even arranged an extra bed for us. It really saved our bad mood. Later, we stayed for 7 consecutive days. In the middle, we experienced a room change and forgot our swimsuit in the previous room.

Change rooms three times in two days! ! !
Figure 1 (room 1) When tidying up the quilt, I found that there were still large blood stains.
Picture 2 (room 1) The hardware facilities are dilapidated.
The duty manager quickly upgraded and changed rooms.
Picture 3 (the second room) A contact lens of the upper resident was left behind at the sink.
Figure 4 (No. 2) The quilt cover is still not clean; there are obvious stains.
Figure 5 After the room change on the first day, the bell had already turned and the manager on duty had explained to me, so I endured for one night; the hotel manager proposed to change the room again the next morning.
Although the third room was upgraded again; but I was too lazy to take pictures, I was so disappointed! ! ! Let me give you another small detail; this Marriott is really frugal Figure 6, 7, 8, 9, so many scratched and old plastic cups are still in use...
The summary is:
The hardware facilities are extremely poor, whether it is the room, the restaurant, the beach (heaps of garbage) or the swimming pool!
The management standard is very poor, one has to say one thing; the response of the duty manager and the hotel manager is immediate; but the standard of other personnel can be seen that the overall management is still very poor, for example: eating in a Chinese restaurant at night, there are at least 8 waiters sat there laughing and playing around.
So it is seriously not recommended that you choose this home!

msg:I have stayed in so many hotels, and this Marriott is the worst one I have ever stayed in. First of all, the location is a bit remote. It is very inconvenient if you don‚Äôt drive by yourself. When you arrive at the hotel, there is no one to pick up your luggage at the door, so forget it. We checked in at the front desk. We went to the room by ourselves and wanted to boil some hot water. No matter how we tried the kettle, it didn‚Äôt work. , I am going to call the front desk for someone to take a look. The phone is not well connected. I have to press the plug with one hand and make a call with the other. The guest room and the engineering depar**ent are both here. The problem is solved. I feel very bad when I just checked in. . Afterwards, I went to the hotel for a walk to get acquainted with the hotel's facilities and environment. I found that the hotel is very small, and I feel that after three years of the epidemic, the current situation of the hotel is quite bad. Many facilities are no longer used. The whole hotel looks very old. It is not at all like the Marriott Hotel that opened in 2018 as mentioned in the introduction. It is very close to the beach. This may be the only consolation. We walked around the hotel. I don‚Äôt know if it was because of the afternoon. We didn‚Äôt meet any service staff or staff. Guests, go to the afternoon tea restaurant on the sixth floor of the hotel. The lights are not turned on. It is very weird. When I go in, there is only one waiter, and I don‚Äôt say hello. I don‚Äôt feel very good about the hotel‚Äôs service. At night, the family was disturbed by mosquitoes. They got up and rummaged for a long time but couldn‚Äôt find mosquito coils. There are few sockets in the room, and some sockets don‚Äôt work at all. It's all dark, and I can only get up in the dark so as not to affect my family at night. Although it is a very small thing that is not worth mentioning, the check-in experience is very bad. From the hardware, I don't feel that it is Marriott's configuration, and from the service, I don't feel the service that Marriott should have. Finally, I would like to thank the front desk for upgrading the pool view room for us for free.

How to dig crabs without tools, how to watch movies without showing them. Since the hotel launched such an event, it must be done well. Otherwise, it will make guests feel that the hotel is cheating

You can see the harbor from the window of the harbor room where you stayed a few days ago, the scenery is already very good. On the last day, thank you Xiao Cai at the front desk for helping us upgrade to a sea view room for free. You can see the sea when you open the window, which is amazing. The room is clean and tidy, the facilities are complete, and the service staff is very attentive. On the last night of my stay, when I returned to the hotel, I found free fruit from the hotel.

Xiaohe Nancy at the front desk not only helped me check in, but also added a customer WeChat account, so you can consult at any time if you have any questions. Booked a sea view room, you can watch the sunrise on the sea from the balcony. Perfume Bay is generally quieter than Qingshui Bay, suitable for rest. Of course, it's not so lively, and there are fewer choices for eating. There is a dross vinegar coconut chicken nearby that is quite delicious.

The originally beautiful beach is full of garbage along the coastline. At least once a few days is enough to clean it up. Although it has the best location, the best beach and the most beautiful scenery, it is indeed ruined by garbage. Finally, I hope Marriott will get better and better.

When I finally checked in, none of the rooms were upgraded. The most hateful thing is that my car is parked in the parking space in the hotel lobby. Got scratched by someone else. The hotel didn't even know. I don't know what the security guards are doing. The key is that I am still the owner of the community. I called the hotel and they said they would give me an explanation after the investigation. It's been days and no one has contacted me. Such a hotel cannot even guarantee safety. Hateful and pathetic.

msg:The location is near R&F Bay in Perfume Bay, and there are many restaurants around. There is a night market, fruit shop, and a small wharf (a local vegetable market) not far away by car at night. Opposite is the yacht club, the harbor room can see yachts, and the sea view room is facing the beach, sea and swimming pool. On the first floor, you can walk to the swimming pool and then the beach. It's nice to take pictures near the beach. The little train, the bird's nest, the lounge chair, the coconut tree, the blue sky and white clouds are all there! ! Both big and small children can play for a long time. There are plenty of activities at the hotel. It is very suitable for parent-child vacation, couple or family self-driving tour. It is a bit inconvenient to take a taxi.
The room is well lit and the photos are beautiful, I don't like the dim lighting. The big mirror is big enough for a pretty person like me. The staff I met in the store are neatly dressed, and they will greet each other proactively, help open the car door, carry luggage, and introduce the hotel environment, which is very friendly. The water pressure of the shower is super strong, too strong. There are sticker reminders on both ends, very careful. The hotel that arrived early, the young lady also checked in early. The aisles are all non-slip tile floors, not carpets, so it is convenient to pull boxes. Carpets are dirty and not easy to care for.
The breakfast variety is okay, with a variety of cheeses to choose from, and the freshly cooked powder tastes good. The imported Swiss coffee machine is very suitable for me, and I even pulled a flower for myself. It is recommended to put a wet towel next to the steam wand next time, and clean it after steaming the milk.
The only bad thing is the children's ocean ball play area on the first floor. The plastic smell is too choking. Not suitable for children to play.

Hygiene: The first room we stayed in had a musty smell as soon as we opened the door. There were bug corpses all around the window, which had obviously been dead for a long time and hadn't been cleaned up. The water glass was stained. So I changed a room. There were spiders that had woven their webs, the bed was full of bugs, there were still watermelon seeds in the bathroom, and there were still water stains. So I changed another room and barely stayed.
Service: Due to hygienic problems, we have to change rooms, and we have to wait for a long time every time, from 8 o'clock in the evening to 1 o'clock in the morning, no one guides, no one apologizes, no compensation, just keep giving you the room card and asking yourself to see. It didn't work after reading it, so I dragged the box and went back to the front desk. Really angry.
We bought the package, but no one reminded us that there is a package, no one told us that rock climbing is only in the morning, so we just missed it, didn't enjoy anything in the package.
Facilities: It is even more weird, every door is broken, there is a hole, and it is obviously deformed. Said the sea is like this. This did not happen to the Hilton or Indigo we lived in.
The water in the room is full of drops, it should have been left for a long time.

The hotel is located in a resort hotel on the beach of Perfume Bay. Let‚Äôs talk about the environment first: Once you enter the lobby, it faces the sea. There are three swimming pools in the middle, a children‚Äôs pool, a romantic pool and a square pool. From the pool to the beach, it‚Äôs a 1-minute walk. We live in a double room with a sea view, with unobstructed views of the endless sea. When the doors and windows are closed at night, it is very quiet. It is suitable for vacation and recuperation, especially for traveling with children. And the most important thing is that when you arrive at the hotel, you will bring your own Vacation and joy (without any commercial a**osphere), if you are lucky enough to come to Hainan again, you will choose this hotel as your first choice.
  Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs breakfast. I saw some bad comments about not changing the types, but what I want to say is that there are more than 30 dishes of all kinds of Western, Chinese and various drinks every day. How do I change them? The hotel's breakfast meets the 5-star standard. It is delicious, has local characteristics, and has many categories. The food environment is really good.
  Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the service. Every waiter will answer what they have to say, and their attitude is very good, especially in the middle of a little episode because of the coconuts bought outside. (The bracelet is stuck at the bottom, and I can‚Äôt find it anyway.) Thanks to the room cleaning sister , the front desk staff and the little brother in the service depar**ent spared no effort to help patiently and meticulously, so that we can have a pleasant and satisfactory vacation.

The room facilities are very good and new, with a cloakroom and a balcony. The bathroom has a bathtub, which is very clean and has no peculiar smell. We also gave a small train ticket at the front desk with our children. The hotel has its own beach, and the lighthouse in the distance is great for taking pictures in the background. Although the waves here are too big to swim in the sea, you can experience it if you like surfing. For swimming, three outdoor swimming pools and a children's pool can also meet the needs. In addition, I would like to share the traffic strategy. The hotel is very close to Lingshui High-speed Railway Station and takes a taxi for 19 minutes and 11 kilometers. It only takes one hour and ten minutes by high-speed rail to Haikou Meilan Airport. It is very convenient to transfer at the same station as Meilan High-speed Railway Station and the airport. The Lingshui high-speed railway station is very small, and it is the ticket gate when you enter. It is enough to arrive half an hour in advance. The flight time from Haikou to most cities is shorter than that from Sanya. The calculation time is the same as going to Sanya Phoenix Airport, but you can check the ticket price yourself.

Asking the front desk to replenish mineral water also responded in a timely manner. The room on the 6th floor has a slight musty smell, which is acceptable for those who are not very sensitive. The balcony is small but there is a small rack for drying clothes. The breakfast is still relatively rich, both Chinese and Western styles, and the coffee is average. The light meal at the restaurant in the evening tastes average. The takeaway ordered at the hotel cannot be delivered, so you have to go down and get it yourself, which is a bit troublesome. There is no laundry room, which is also inconvenient. It is very convenient to go to the beach. The elevator goes to the first floor and passes through the children's wading pool and swimming pool, but the beach area is not large. We happened to be filming when we were staying, and the security guards didn't let us go to the beach, so we went back after watching it for a few minutes.

msg:Coming to Lingshui from Sanya, I chose not the most popular Qingshui Bay, but I chose the Marriott Hotel in Perfume Bay, because the hotel goes straight out of the beach! When I arrived at the hotel, I found that this choice was perfect. The distance between the hotel and the beach is super close, and there is no need to take long gardens or detours! Moreover, Justin Xiaocai, the front desk manager on duty, is very nice. He will care about our check-in experience and help us upgrade the room. The hotel's children's facilities are relatively old, but there are many things to play...especially the bubble party at the pool, the children are so happy...you can also choose this hotel if you want to take a shower, there are other clubs outside the beach

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first: 1. I went for the Marriott brand, the hotel lobby is amazing, the door is directly facing the beach and the sea, which is eye-catching and has a holiday a**osphere. 2. Outside the first floor of the hotel are coconut groves, swimming pools, beaches, and the sea, which fully satisfy the holiday experience and make people feel happy. 3. The sea view on the high floors is very charming, and I am in a good mood. 4: The hotel rooms are clean and hospitable. The following is the part that I personally think needs to be improved during this stay: 1. The hotel staff is too small, and the staff training needs to be strengthened: the colleague booked two sea view rooms, one on the 5th floor and the other on the 3rd floor, check-in At that time, the front desk did not explain the difference in the scenery of the room types on the 3rd floor. I don't know if it's because of the off-season of tourism or what. The hotel staff is too small, the hotel is very big, there is no guidance after check-in, the elevators on each floor do not communicate with each other, and I did get lost in the hotel after returning to the room after going downstairs. After arriving at the room on the third floor, the air was not very good, and there was a strong smell of damp. The view outside the windows on the lower floor was only the garden view, and the gap was big, so I called the front desk to change the floor (at this time, I really felt like the hotel staff Insufficient) The afternoon may be the peak time for hotel check in/out. I made several calls back and forth and waited for more than half an hour before replying. As a resort hotel, the staff did not inform the hotel whether there are activities in the evening and the hotel's facilities (such as gym KTV, etc.), and they only found out after a follow-up call. Because there is a follow-up trip to Sanya, I checked out at 12:30 noon the next day. I checked in at the hotel in Sanya at 5:00 p.m. I was surprised that Marriott did not help us with the check-out procedure. , As a result, the hotel ID verification in Sanya could not be checked in. It has been 5 hours since Marriott checked out, and I called Marriott later to make up for it. As a brand hotel, such low-level mistakes should not occur, right? (This is also the first time I have stayed in a hotel for so many times) 2. There is room for further improvement in the hotel's hardware and software facilities: the hotel's interior facilities are old-fashioned, the cleaning products are average, and there are not many options for breakfast . As a resort hotel there is no activity at night, it is very boring. (Attach video/picture: 1-2 lobby view, 3-4: 3rd floor view, 5-6: 5th floor view, 7-8: hotel garden beach, 8: hotel breakfast room.)

Lingshui, which is 70 kilometers away from Sanya City, is a good choice. It's an hour's drive away, and there aren't many five-star hotels. Marriott bears the brunt of it, and it's a parent-child hotel, so choose him. First of all, I want to praise Ms. Shi Xiaojin, the receptionist at the front desk. She is kind and sweet, and the most important thing is her excellent ability to solve problems. Second, for the parent-child room, Xiaobao is very satisfied and happy. Personally, it would be better if the room was bigger. However, the scenery is infinitely good. Third, the hotel's beach scenery is great, and every place is a holy place for taking pictures. The only two disadvantages are that there is no heated swimming pool for children. It is quite cool to enter the water this season. Second, the customer's demand response is not too timely. Overall satisfaction, compared with other five-star hotels in Sanya, it is worth staying here.

msg:advantage:
-The beach of the hotel is great, the water is clear and the waves are big, you can watch the sea, and you can also play sea sports. Many children are learning to surf.
- The swimming pool is also good, with a relatively large area. There is a children's pool, which is suitable for bringing children. It is close to the beach and takes pictures of my wife. It's a pity that there is no heated swimming pool, and the water is a bit cold in winter.
- The room size is large and the facilities are relatively new, but unfortunately there is no smart toilet.
shortcoming:
-The environment outside the hotel is relatively poor. I drove in a potholed road for a long time. Before I saw the hotel, my mood was down to the end.
- There are few varieties of breakfast, Chinese restaurants are not recommended, the service attitude and dishes are average.
- There are too few charging piles, only four, and two of them can only charge Tesla, which costs 100 yuan at a time. The service awareness of individual staff needs to be strengthened. My family members fell asleep at almost 12 o'clock in the middle of the night and called our room to ask me to move the car to charge someone else. It is a bit unacceptable. In the future, if there is such a need, the customer can be notified earlier.

There are not many people, so it is very comfortable. There are many restaurants within 10 minutes of walking, which are very delicious, and the fruit is even better. You must buy a small watermelon if you can meet it. It is so sweet. There are also local mangoes, but the bananas I bought are so-so.
Going back to the hotel, the breakfast is very good, with both Chinese and Western food. There are two breakfast restaurants to choose from, both of which are the same.
By the way, remind friends, there will be mosquitoes here, remember to bring anti-itch cream, I don‚Äôt know what will happen tonight, I caught mosquitoes until late yesterday.
The overall is still very good, recommended, mainly because the scenery is really beautiful.

Then we went back at 5:00 p.m. After chatting with the cleaning staff, I learned that they also have staff members, so one person has to clean 20-23 rooms on average, and each room takes 30-40 minutes on average, so it is slow.
2. There are few places to eat around the hotel, and it takes about 30 minutes to drive to Lingshui County;
3. There are relatively few parking spaces in the hotel. If you go back late at night, you can basically only park on the side of the road outside the hotel gate area.

In contrast, I would like to praise the aunt who is in charge of cleaning the room. I asked if there were disposable slippers for children. In the case that the hotel did not have them, I thought of other ways for us. This kind of service spirit is the only way to be a Marriott hotel. The way it should be! The most ridiculous thing is that a biscuit spilled on the stairs of the hotel. During the stay for three days and two nights, no hotel staff noticed or cared about it. It was still there until the last day of check-out. This is the only way to have breakfast in the lobby. There are also desolate villages around the hotel. It is not very friendly for tourists with children to choose a restaurant. I will not choose this hotel next time, nor will I choose Perfume Bay again.

There is a lovely lighthouse opposite, and the swimming pool is also very good. It is suitable for parent-child travel. The rooms on the fifth floor of the North Building, especially 501-510, are the gym upstairs. There are people running and lifting weights early in the morning, so the noise is too loud. At 11 o'clock in the evening, there are still people practicing loudly, so I had to call the front desk to complain. , In fact, it is a problem of hotel management, there should be an opening time!

The second time I stayed at the Fragrance Bay Marriott Hotel. The service of the hotel is still attentive. I know that I take children on a summer vacation. When I checked in, I introduced the hotel's summer schedule. I also successfully dumped my baby during my stay..
The hotel is very attentive, and children's surfing üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è boards are prepared in the swimming pool. It enriches children's water activities.
The hotel's sea view room is amazing! The whole picture outside the window is full of sea. It overflows üßè‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

LEA at the front desk was very polite and even helped to upgrade the suite. The children were super happy. The hotel's hygiene service attitude is not picky. Enjoy activities in the hotel, you can surf at R&F Bay, the swimming pool is fun, the restaurant has good breakfast and dinner, and the service is considerate. The porter saw that our car was about to go down to the parking lot and kept following him to help with our luggage. Later, because I had to wait for one more nucleic acid result, I stayed for one more night. If it wasn't for the epidemic, I could stay for two more nights, and the children would not tire of playing. Next time I have the opportunity to go to Lingshui again, I must stay, the price is very high! recommend!

(1) There are few varieties of breakfast, and it is the same every day. I stayed for 4 days, and the breakfast was the same for 4 days
(2) For two days in a row, cockroaches and other insects appeared in the room. I called the waiter to ask if there was any insect repellant, etc. The waiter blamed me for not paying attention when closing the door‚ö†Ô∏è
(3) The quality of the beach is actually not bad. The sand is no less fine than Yalong Bay. The rubbish on the ground is shocking.
(4) The quality of the waiter was low. The breakfast was hot outside. I wanted to choose a table near the fan. It happened that the waiter was cleaning up. I said there is a fan here, and the waiter shouted again: It's the same over there! So I listened to him and went to the table over there to see that there was something on the table indicating that someone was there, I could only walk back and wait for him silently, he was so angry that he kept thinking
(5) The hotel's swimming pools, beaches, and recreational facilities are open to the public, 58 yuan per person, and you can enter if you give money. The staff is messy and extremely chaotic
(6) The management staff of the pulp board at the swimming pool charged me 100 yuan an hour. If you are more careful and wander around more, you will find that the small blackboard at the service desk not far away reads 50 yuan an hour.
(7) Our family of three only supplies 2 bottles of 500ml mineral water every day. After cleaning the house, we do not provide disposable slippers on our own initiative. We have to ask the front desk to ask for it.
Summary: The hardware is barely passable, the management is chaotic, and the service staff needs to be strengthened

msg:Because I wanted to go to Lingshui to see Monkey Island and R&F Ocean World, I only booked the hotel after seeing the reviews that the parent-child hotel had crab catching activities. The result was very disappointing, and it felt like stepping on thunder.
There is no service at the hotel check-in, and there is no introduction after the formalities. For parent-child activities, you have to ask yourself. You have to ask for the small train and go-kart tickets that are presented, and the gift is only a circle. The service staff said that this is the experience, and you can spend more money if you want to sit. The problem is that trains and karts are very general, and I don't want to continue playing after seeing these service attitudes.
There is a gecko at the door of the room, and the toilet is smelly. After calling to inform, he came and sprayed me with air freshener, and it hurt me badly. Don't think about the bathtub, it's yellow, and there is no bathtub cover.
The beach is dirty, full of plastic bottles, garbage bags, and dead fish in coconut shells. The pool water is not clean and there is sand. The slide facilities are also very old.

The only good thing is that there is a staff on the beach who is very enthusiastic to take children to catch crabs. It feels quite cozy.

Originally, I wanted to stay in a hotel for two days and then go out to play. As a result, I didn't want to stay for a minute, so I went to R&F Ocean World one day and Monkey Island one day. The play project is quite happy, but the traffic is a bit far. It takes about an hour to go anywhere.

I don't recommend this hotel very much. I came to Sanya four times and stayed in twenty small hotels. This is the worst! !

msg:The third time I came to Sanya, my wife named her to go to Lingshui. Since I brought Xiaocai this time, I compared many hotels and finally chose Marriott at Fragrance Bay. The hotel is generally good, and the hardware facilities are still available. The only downside is that there are no chairs on the balcony. Personally, it is recommended to have a chair and a small table. It is also good to have some beer in the evening. There is also a special thanks to the reception brother, the service is very warm and attentive. Due to the location of the hotel, most of the meals are selected at the hotel. There are not many types of breakfast, but it is not as bad as the Internet says. Lunch dinner tastes good and ingredients are fresh.
The hotel lifts to the 1st floor to go out to the swimming pool. The water quality is clean. Every afternoon, there is a bubble bath that children like. It's a lot of fun.
Not to mention the seascape, I look at the photos by myself, it is so beautiful that it makes people feel relaxed and happy.
The only shortcoming is that the room hygiene needs to be improved, especially the carpets, carpets and carpets under the bed are really too dirty to describe in words. It is estimated that they have not been changed or cleaned. I hope the hotel will pay attention to it and clean it diligently , replace it.
The above comments are absolutely true feelings, absolutely no extravagance.

Ctrip Platinum members and Marriott Gold members cannot enjoy the privileges repeatedly. Ctrip members can upgrade the room to the Harbour King Room for free. Although the sea view is not visible, the view is not bad.
It is suitable for friends to go surfing together. The beach here is really good. The waves are not big or small, and the beach is gentle, not as deep as Haitang Bay. The hotel has parent-child activities, there is no hotel surfing counselor, and the surf shop outside also missed the opportunity due to physical reasons.
One day in the hotel room for diarrhea. The little girl at the front desk gave me less than 150 tax-free vouchers

I didn't even remind me that the room number for the Wi-Fi order was different from the one written on the door card. It was my fault that I wrote the wrong room number and didn't add 8 to the front of the order after half a day! May I ask where it says to add 8? The door card can't open the door 4 times without a magnet! Really unheard of. The sand on the beach in the south building is very rough and dirty, but the north one looks better. The crab digging activity that I engaged in didn't even have a tool, and I pulled it with my hands. In short, in addition to the size of the sanitary room like a five-star. Others... hehe!

I have stayed in Beijing Marriott before and felt pretty good. I was dumbfounded at first. My husband took the luggage off the car by himself. I watched the two children on the side of the road. After checking in, the front desk called out a person who didn‚Äôt wear work clothes and said, "Help me get the luggage." The front desk became impatient and repeated it. In the end, the little brother enthusiastically helped us deliver the luggage to the room. He was even more dumbfounded as soon as he entered the room. There is a sign warning not to take away toys. Do we suspect this is an international hotel that pays more than a thousand nights? Putting down the luggage. My husband said that it seems to be a few levels different from the Shangri-La and Westin that live in front. We said forget to go outside. It turned out that the children's activity group who entered the hotel said that there was a crab catching activity at night, and did not say where to gather. Seeing where someone in the group asked, the hotel staff replied "beach" fascinatingly. We left the group after looking for the beach for a long time without finding it. give up. In the evening, I went to the restaurant to eat. I walked to the entrance of the western restaurant and told that a team could not accept it. I wanted to order a drink after I went to the Chinese restaurant. I was told that I didn't have a wine list and went to the freezer to look at it myself. Constantly refreshing the perception of star-rated hotels, no one helped you take the baby chair for breakfast, and the wind was too windy after you moved it, I asked the waiter can the door be closed? The little girl said that I can‚Äôt shut you up and sit in another position. After talking about standing there and watching us move the children and the dishes to another table by ourselves, we didn‚Äôt participate in helping the whole process. Maybe the little girl was only trained to collect the dishes. A man in white clothes similar to a manager stood outside the door and used his mobile phone all the time. He wanted to comment and gave up after standing for a while and seeing that he was too busy. After breakfast, we have reached the limit of our patience and decided to check out early and change to a hotel. We decided to write an email to Marriott Asia Pacific headquarters when we have time to ask them to experience this Marriott by themselves and tell us whether this is the quality of Marriott. If they think it is, then Marriott can be excluded from our optional list in the future.

Thank you very much üôè The hotel has organized many free recreational activities, surfing and paddle boarding activities in the afternoon, and the father of the child goes every day and has a great time. ; There are many small landscapes on the beach of the hotel, which increase the fun of taking pictures.

I booked a sea-view room, unlike some hotels in Sanya, which spent a four-digit figure and could only see one line of the sea.
The facilities and so on are nothing, but the service is very good. When you arrive at the hotel parking lot, someone will help with your luggage, and you will continue to introduce the hotel and hotel activities on the way to the room.
The breakfast is nothing but the kind, but the service is still very satisfying. From guiding and arranging seats to treating people and things, it is very good. When I took the meal, I asked whether the watermelon was gone? In addition to answering me "I will have it soon", the staff took the initiative to serve a plate to my table, which is a very dedicated service.

At first, I felt that there were a lot of mosquitoes in the pool, the sand on the beach was co****r, and the room was older, so I was disappointed! I wanted to retreat for a day!

but! It‚Äôs fun to catch crabs at night, and the breakfast on the next day is delicious and rich (now boiled porridge yyds) The slides in the indoor ocean ball pool are fun. Children‚Äôs water slides with awnings. Free surfing places for club music. Everything is so comfortable! The atmosphere is full, and I feel in a trance that I am drinking and dancing in a small town in Southeast Asia

In addition: I really want to praise the restaurant's 38 yuan "little adult meal". We have ordered pasta and egg fried rice for the children. They are delicious and generous! The manager also helped us avoid the packing cost, which is great!

Drive low and go high instantly! Fall in love with this hotel! Maybe I was lucky and didn‚Äôt encounter those things that some bad reviews said~

Finally, Mr. Chen at the front desk was really great, and the other staff looked tired and not very kind.

msg:üçÉEnvironment:
The first time I came to Lingshui, I have always liked Marriott's hotel, so I booked it here, but I didn't feel very satisfied overall after staying for two days. First of all, the location is very good. There is a swimming pool and beach downstairs. It is very convenient to play with the baby and the sea view is also very positive.

üîîService:
The decoration and facilities of the hotel are a bit old, and the cleaning of a lot of leaves in the pool on a rainy day is not very timely. The service is a bit average, not as good as other five-star hotels. The room card is broken and I have to wait for someone to open the door for more than ten minutes. . . The rooms are not cleaned in time. The taste of Chinese restaurant dishes is generally not cost-effective.
Another thing that is not good is that in the hotel that focuses on parenting, there are no children's products in the room, and the tables, chairs and benches are all sharp corners, which is not very safe. Hope it can be improved later.

During the period, Nancy also asked about the feeling of staying and taking care of it many times. It was very good, and the questions were resolved quickly after many questions.
üçÉEnvironment: Although it is a distance from Sanya, the hotel environment is generally very good. There is a water park that children like, and an internet celebrity check-in point where adults can check in. During the day at the Ruby Bar, have afternoon tea, go downstairs for a swim, eat some seafood in the evening and then take the baby to catch crabs. It's a perfect day!
What makes me the most addictive is that the room is made of a very good brand of spa products in Thailand‚Äîthann, it tastes very comfortable and healing!

Especially Xiao He who checked in at the front desk (He Qiumin, here must be praised by his real name!) has a strong sense of service and will always help me at the most appropriate time, and has always taken care of us! Not only can we give a comprehensive and detailed introduction to the hotel‚Äôs various facilities and activities when we check in, but also take the initiative to care about us during our stay, remind us of the dining time and place at breakfast the next day, and take the initiative to help us replenish the mineral springs. Water, all kinds of things we didn't think of, Xiaohe helped you think of it! It's a butler service! Must like it! Although Perfume Bay Marriott has no advantages in terms of external environment and geographical location, the internal management, services, facilities and environment of the hotel far surpass other hotels in Sanya Bay and Haitang Bay. The hotel has a variety of activities. In addition to the activity schedule, guests will be informed in advance in the group, so that guests can learn about the hotel‚Äôs activities anytime and anywhere, and they can make reservations for the activities they want to participate in. One of the most satisfying aspects of R&F Bay Marriott is that the hotel layout and design are great! Particularly suitable for taking pictures, you can shoot blockbuster movies easily without filters! And the hotel swimming pool and outdoor area are equipped with various props for young ladies who like to take photos! R&F Bay Marriott is really super super! A paradise away from the busy city!

Let me talk about the advantages 1-When I arrived at the hotel, a staff member came to help with luggage. When checking in, Xiao Cai worked in an orderly manner. Because there was no room, I sincerely told me that there was no room upgrade, and I accepted. In the afternoon, I again Please Danny Zhuang at the front desk to help me print the child's paper. I have been tirelessly printing it three times. Thank you. Mr. Yang celebrated his birthday on the 19th and made a birthday decoration. The child was very happy.
The water spray in the children‚Äôs pool is fun, there are bars on the beach, there are many photo props for internet celebrities, and surfers. The a**osphere is beautiful. The breakfast is rich, and the freshly cooked fish porridge is recommended. The swimming pool and beach security staff are very responsible. When children play on the beach, staff in security uniforms will come over and ask where the parents are? I also saw him patrolling the beach every once in a while, and the swimming pool staff kept checking, telling the child that there was thunder and lightning, not to be in the pool, I felt really serious. Generally speaking, the staff is enthusiastic and not overbearing.
Of course, for five-star hotels, there are also some shortcomings. The hotel room, the furniture is not well maintained, the paint is obviously falling off, there are too few cute pets, 4 rabbits, 5 turtles and 3 peacocks. The interaction with the children is not full. The most annoying thing is the kart experience. I understand experiential marketing very well. I experience first and then sell. But when the kart staff saw that the child was holding an experience voucher, they were immediately unhappy. They all showed up on their faces without saying a word. The face is impatient and the movements are careless, the child feels it, and is very angry! The same is the horse riding experience coupon, the staff is very enthusiastic, clearly telling what the experience is and what service is consumed, in sharp contrast. In addition, the beach is not clean, there are all kinds of garbage, plastic bottles, cigarette butts and slippers. I don't know why the hotel does not maintain the beach environment.

I just sat down in the swimming pool and it was about to rain. The staff actually put away the parasol and asked me if I still need it? The typhoon is coming, I have to put it away! I said: The typhoon has not come yet. They didn't listen to me and put it away anyway, leaving the guests in the rain. The most infuriating thing is that the children's facilities are old and improperly maintained. A thick piece of paint fell off and stuck into my child's toenail. The child cried in pain and blood flowed. We immediately returned to the room and called the hotel. Nothing else was said, just to send disinfectants. As a result, after we urged twice, Ctrip urged twice, a total of 4 times, the disinfectant was finally sent nearly 2 hours later. There was no apology throughout the whole process. Safety issues are a joke in this hotel. Ctrip learned about this and coordinated with the hotel. The hotel said it would send a fruit plate to apologize, but I didn't know where the fruit plate was from beginning to end. It was really speechless. There are many dead corners in the room, and thick dust accumulates in many places. I really can't believe this is a star hotel. This is the worst hotel on my trip to Hainan. My family originally booked 2 nights, but we only stayed one night and fled in a hurry. I didn't want my children to get hurt again. Looking at the service attitude of the staff, it is clear that safety accidents are not surprising. I originally wanted to complain to the hotel about this matter and hold them responsible, but then I thought about it and just took it as a loss. I will never come to this hotel again. Attached are photos, look at the dust on the bedside alarm clock and air conditioner switch. It's disgusting

msg:Advantages... Except for the location, there is no advantage, but I still praise the front desk Cai Ben
           I answered questions before, and I was sincere and satisfied with the service.
Disadvantages... 1 Check-out at the front desk is always in line. When check-out at peak hours, one person is still dealing with it, and the front desk is noisy. A black face is like a man who owes money, like a foreman, he can only bow his head all the time, and no guests are also bowing his head. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm playing on the phone or looking at the computer. I don‚Äôt understand that you can never see the computer when you look up. Is there anything else in it, and there is no service, who recruited you for this virtue? ? ?
2 If you have children, you can refer to it. I stayed for one night and the soles of the children‚Äôs feet were broken, and the children found it hurt when they walked. Fortunately, I brought iodine, but I thought that the front desk provided band-aids for the children to stick to their shoes. Grinding his feet, the black-faced person called the concierge, and the concierge was the only one who needed to collect the luggage, store it, and also charge the airport fee and check the car at the duty-free shop... You are the Marriott concierge alone. Work? ? ? I have seen people call the restaurant twice to bring it up, but after standing awkwardly on the spot for more than ten minutes, no one answered. Can I prepare more band-aids with iodine swabs at the beach? ? ? So pay more attention to your child, and if you have any questions, you must start calling one hour in advance
This hotel is obviously not enough waiters. Regardless of the restaurant or the hotel, after a rant, a so-called manager named Lu Chenglong said that if you don't take the camera, I will apologize. If you are willing to apologize, it means that you know something is wrong, and you are afraid of being exposed, so you dare not apologize in person.

Multiple online celebrity check-in points can shoot the blockbuster you want. There are many parent-child activities that can make adults and children have fun. As the commercial facilities of Perfume Bay are not yet mature, it is recommended to go by car. The overall feeling is very good, recommend friends to stay.

The soft service is very good, especially the group organization activities, which can let everyone know what activities there are every day, not bad! There are also quite a lot of breakfast varieties. The children in the pool like it. The water will be sprayed in the afternoon. The nearby takeaways are not expensive and they are quite delicious! Five points praise! By the way, the beach is great, very beautiful, and there are two lighthouses, which are more beautiful than the Westin Clearwater Beach at the back!

msg:There are many five-star hotels in Sanya. Recently, I have come to Sanya too many times. I have been on business trips, so I have a little understanding of hotels in Sanya. This time I compared many hotels in this itinerary. Finally I chose Lingshui Perfume Bay outside the hustle and bustle. It takes about 20 minutes for the high-speed rail to go to Lingshui, and the Lingshui Station drops by over 30 yuan to the Marriott Hotel (about 20 minutes by car).
Arriving in the hotel lobby, the open blue sea view makes you instantly start the vacation mode. The little brothers in the reception and concierge depar**ent are very attentive and attentive. He quickly obtained the room card to open the "room blind box". The room is quite large, and there is a On a small balcony, you can see the swimming pool and the sea when you open the window screens. I don‚Äôt want to move when I lie on the sofa next to the floor-to-ceiling windows. But the hotel really can‚Äôt just lie down on vacation. You have to go to the beach and walk through the clean and bright swimming pool. The most beautiful one I have ever seen), bypassing the mini-karting yard, and arriving at the beach, there are a lot of internet celebrity check-in points, there is also a surfing experience center, a small house ‚ûï two desert tents, the mood is good, every afternoon from 4 to 4 There is a surfboard experience at half past two, walking on the fine sand to the sea, being chased by the white waves, it is quite fun, the important thing is that the handsome coach will always be with you, and feel full of security.
What makes me most satisfied with this Marriott hotel is the service. Whether it‚Äôs the lobby, guest room, restaurant, beach, or swimming pool, I can see a sweet smile everywhere I go. After staying for two nights, I finally concluded that I can come again. And would recommend it to friends who like a quiet vacation.

There are also many experience programs in the hotel. After staying for 6 days, I experienced 4 body boarding and it was really fun. The hotel staff were very friendly and smiled and said hello when they met. Xiao Cai at the front desk must give praise, check-in and late check-out are quick and not slacking at all. Oh, there were some questions during the stay. Ctrip's customer service grapefruit also quickly helped solve it. Generally speaking, the travel experience is very good!

msg:A super cost-effective hotel. I have stayed in many hotels in Hainan before. Basically, I chose to stay for two nights and I almost need to change to a fresh environment. This time I stayed for three nights and the kids didn‚Äôt want to go to play. In addition to the children‚Äôs facilities in the pool, the kids club also Very good, divided into two parts, indoor and outdoor, outdoor facilities for small animals, rock climbing, archery, and climbing. There are also a wealth of activities arranged in the hotel. Karting, bonfire party, crab catching, horse riding, and small trains are also arranged in the hotel. The daily free surfing experience activities provided to adults are simply great value. The photo check-in spots on the beach also stand out, and the small red and green lighthouses are full of literary style. Really a very fun hotel.
Let‚Äôs talk about the service again. When you check in from the front desk, it makes you feel taken care of. At that time, it was Shi Xiaojin who served us. I really remembered her name on my own initiative. If you upgrade your room, you will get breakfast and introduce hotel activities. The concierge helped to introduce the facilities of the activity group and every item was very patient and could feel the sincere service. So even if she did not ask to praise her personally, I still remembered and decided to write her name to express my gratitude. Afterwards, the room service, cleaning staff, and the hotel staff are all very good, and sometimes they can feel their youthfulness, but they are not negligent. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of bringing the kids. Everyone is very friendly and patient.
The hotel rooms are more practical and have everything that should be available. The beds are comfortable and the accessories are good. Toiletries are Thai THANN. The best is the sofa. It is the bed for my children. Hahahahaha. It is estimated that children under 1.3 meters can sleep. Our room has a view of the harbour. It is very beautiful when the weather is clear. We also saw two couples taking wedding photos on the yacht.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the location that everyone minds. Because we are renting a car and driving, the journey is relatively smooth. From the high-speed down and following the navigation, the walking is very good. I want to go to a place to eat. It takes about 20 minutes to drive to the central area where the Lingshui County Government is located. The county, but KFC, McDonald's, and Dad Star all have, to tell the truth, it feels a bit more prosperous than the downtown Wanning that I visited before. If you don‚Äôt want to travel far, you can consider going to a nearby seafood food stall. Although the price of seafood is not cheap, you can choose to eat stir-fried dishes. On the last day, I ran into a family who came by high-speed rail. They said that it is very convenient to take a taxi from the high-speed rail station. In addition, the hotel also has a small supermarket where you can buy snacks, drinks and instant noodles. We bought big buckets of drinking water.
In addition, the beach is very thin, although the waves are too big to swim, but the kids love it very much by digging in the sand and catching crabs!

The only thing I want to complain about is the Chinese restaurant in the hotel just after 8 o'clock in the evening. We have all finished the dishes and have not finished the hotel. The price is expensive and understands but at least the service should be mentioned. To be honest, the taste is really super unpalatable and really average Any flies restaurant in Sichuan can‚Äôt compare to the taste, but the service is not good enough to get together. As a result, the service can‚Äôt keep up. The staff will wait for a long time for everything. It is recommended not to eat and stay in the hotel.
