msg:Is that a real five-star hotel? I don’t think so, first, all 3 USB sockets broken, pointpen broken and hair dryer was burnt. The good thing is the room is very big than expected, especially the shower room, I like that. Anyway, both the pricing and environment are not matched so much. The top platform is amazing, where can be able to watch the west lake in a long view. I think that hotel management can try to improve some service details in the future.

msg:Pros:
- Very convenient location, a couple of minutes walk to the West Lake.
- The lobby is spotless, check in/out is smooth.
- We went with a driver/tour guide (Zhu Feng) associated with the hotel who was very helpful, drove us around the lake for most of a day in pouring rain.
- Bellman is very helpful with loading luggage (he needs to work out more though :).
- Breakfast is good, but not great.

Cons
- The room is a little outdated, needs some maintenance work.
- The AC is the worst. The one in our room was blasting air all day long, but can barely keep the temperate at 25 C (77 F).
- The gym is pretty crappy. Looks like it's been rented out for external use, and it's not very clean or well maintained.

Overall got a good bone but needs some management shakeup and remodeling.

Stay at the hotel room is  unpleasantly warm as the centralized aircon has difficulty setting below 26degC. We’ve reported to hotel and was informed it’s due to our room facing the morning sun. They send us an extra fan for ventilation.

The hotel itself has a large gym and yet quite quiet.
The hotel looks like an old fashioned hotel with wooden decoration interior.

Breakfast had lots of great options for everyone, there was one female cook that didn’t seem to want to hold things for me on the side while I was handling stuff for the wife and baby, but the manager took care of it for us, so once again, amazing service. Room was big and well maintained albeit a bit old. Wife insisted that I mentioned the amazing quality of the soap. I’ll say that the bed was a bit too soft for us, but I’m sure others will love that. Thank you to everyone for making our stay so relaxing. Will definitely stay again!!

The room itself was large and clean; there was even a little balcony. But the room was pretty warm, and no matter what I did with the thermostat, the temperature either didn't change or went up. So I had to sleep with the balcony door open one night to let in some cooler air. And my kids and I were disappointed that the pool wasn't open. But still, I would definitely stay here again, due to the location and room size & layout.

The hotel staffs are nice and helpful instead of one of the concierges who asked for my green code but also did not check it at all (kind of ignorance). However, the front office staff did a good job to help me to have a smooth check-in and check-out process. The Mountain view room is my favorite one and the hotel's location which is just hundreds of meters away from the West Lake supported my leisure trip. Above all, the Flexibooking offered by Trip.com also made me less worried during the pandemic. Will make sure to come again next time.

In comparison, the service is quite good, the front desk is responsible, the cleaning aunt is very polite and enthusiastic, and the restaurant waiter adds meals in time and politely. But it is too dilapidated. If the hotel does not rectify, it can only go bankrupt. I really prefer to go one kilometer further to a five-star hotel with similar level and price, but with matching location!

After eating at night, I bought a takeaway for a late-night snack and it was a five-minute walk to the hotel. The room was not air-conditioned enough and I had to ask the engineering staff for the second night. A little better; the first time I ordered ** takeout, I had to go to the lobby to pick it up. But when I went to the hotel to pick it up, he arranged for a robot to deliver it to the room. When I ordered ** takeout at night, I expected the hotel to arrange a robot. The room was delivered to me, but I couldn't find it after waiting for a long time. It also took time to arrange, and I had to go to the lobby to pick up the takeaway. The service was relatively poor; the indoor swimming pool was not as good as the online hotel, but the fitness room was poorly equipped. It is fully equipped, but there are no small towels even in the cold weather. I have to use the big towels in the swimming pool. The service needs to be improved. Looking out at the mountain view, I can see that the tower is beautiful, but when I see the terrace opposite, there seem to be many long-term tenants filled with sundries. It seems that the terrace is not a proper management for a Wuyu-level hotel, because seeing a lot of debris opposite will affect the appearance; the hotel should consider improving its management.

msg:It’s hard to describe this hotel, so everyone must be careful when booking!

Before check-in, hotel staff will inexplicably call you and send you a WeChat message to tell you that the room has been upgraded and that the guest service will be provided.
But the reality was much worse. We were given a very poor room, and we couldn't solve the problems we encountered. On the last day, we came to ask for positive reviews, saying, "The leader insists on positive reviews, and we won't be allowed to leave work if we don't give positive reviews."

1. About the room:
We arrived at night that day, and we felt bad the moment we opened the room. The room was filled with mirrors, almost the entire room was filled with mirrors. There is a row of mirrors in the corridor, the wardrobe in the bathroom, and the doors of the wardrobe are all covered with mirrors. The mirror in the corridor corresponds to the mirror in the closet in the bathroom. The pattern is very strange, you can experience it yourself.
There are no illustrations or descriptions of these things in the hotel room introduction. When I asked the front desk, the front desk was very vague. It just feels like I am deliberately avoiding it.
In the toilet room, the toilet seat is broken and covered with dust. At a glance, it looks dirty. There is a box of toilet paper next to the toilet. There is only one piece of paper in it, and there is also a layer of dust on the toilet paper box. If someone checked out this room before and the guest room came in for cleaning, would these hygiene issues go unnoticed? Why were the consumables not added in time? So obviously this room must have been unoccupied for a long, long time.
So we immediately communicated with the previous concierge and guest service, and the reply he gave was that all rooms were of this type.

After we returned to the hotel after dinner, the front desk said they would change a room for us. Unexpectedly, it was the same room as before. Before we went out, we made a clear request for a clean room with so many mirrors, but the front desk changed us to a room that was exactly the same as the original one. So what does this mean?

Later, after a long period of communication, we moved to a similar room next door. Since it was already past 11 o'clock in the middle of the night, we only stayed for two nights, so we did not communicate with them again.
There was a problem with the room. We spent a lot of time looking up and down the room at the front desk. In fact, the room we changed to in the end also had problems. I felt a little uncomfortable. It was already almost 12 o'clock after the room change that day. It was very terrible. Tired. So I don’t want to communicate with them anymore in the future.

2. About room hygiene
The new room we moved to was also very unsanitary. The exhaust system was very weak and the bathroom was always filled with a faint smell of cigarette smoke.
I don't know if it was alcohol or something, but there was a big stain on the bedside.
There was visible hair on the sheets.
The toiletries in the bathroom were placed in a wooden box, but the wooden box had become moldy and water-infested. A very dirty feeling.
There was probably a clothes-drying rope in the bathroom, but it was modified.
The door's safety lock has been modified and has obvious traces.
The whole room feels very dark even if all the lights are turned on.
Maybe it’s just that it’s been open for a long time, and many things have been patched, making the experience of staying here really bad.

When we went out the next day, there was no need for housekeeping, and there was no sign saying it would be cleaned immediately. However, it was still cleaned when we came back in the evening.

3. Breakfast
There are very few types of breakfast, and some porridge and the like are cold. Although it is a buffet breakfast, after walking around, I have no appetite at all.
For Intercontinental hotels with similar prices, Wyndham is really far behind. Therefore, it is recommended that if you are booking a hotel, there is no need to book a double breakfast.
There are only a few people eating breakfast, which shows how high the occupancy rate is.

In general, it is called an old hotel, and it is indeed an old hotel! The main theme is "old", and the soft furnishings in the room can really be replaced.
In terms of price, it’s about the same price. I still recommend you to choose Intercontinental or West Lake Shangri-La, or the slightly more expensive Grand Hyatt and Shangri-La in the city.
The only advantage of this hotel is that it is close to the West Lake, making it easier to walk to the West Lake. But in other terms, whether it is facilities, rooms or hotel services, they are far from their pricing.

Another note: On the last day we checked out and went to pick up the luggage stored at the front desk, we were dragged back to ask for a good review. They also forcibly took our luggage and said they would send us out. This really made the guests who checked in feel very uncomfortable.

It's just five stops away from Hangzhou East Station on Metro Line 1. The hotel assigns a service ambassador to each guest, who can contact you in advance and provide considerate service. When I was not nervous during the workday, I was upgraded to a room for free so that I could see the sunset.
The breakfast is rich, the red soup noodles and small wontons are delicious, but the vegetarian dishes are a bit lacking.
My service ambassador, Larry, is a gentle and friendly kid who has good reviews.

We stayed for three days in a row, and the room was not cleaned thoroughly and the sanitary conditions were poor. There were very few types of breakfast, and the dishes were not changed during the three days we stayed. We were speechless. Our family of four had breakfast. In the morning, I went to get 5 vegetable buns. The waiter was very upset and asked me not to take so many. I said There were four of us eating, and there would be nothing left after eating. She even said with a stern face that you can take it after you finish eating. The luggage cart was not willing to send it to the parking lot when checking out. The service was so bad. Don’t stay here for family or traveling. It’s a hotel, it affects my mood too much.

msg:For my mother's birthday, I took my parents and daughter on a trip. I chose a five-star hotel that was close to the West Lake and not too expensive.
Good things: When checking in, the hotel noticed that it was my mother's birthday, and took the initiative to send two rooms fruits (very good quality) and a big cake (very good taste), and upgraded two rooms to lake view rooms.
Areas that can be improved: When I entered the room where my daughter and I were staying, we found that the toilet was not cleaned. There were several pieces of used toilet paper in the toilet basket, and there were a few drops of suspected urine on the toilet seat. I was really shocked. The layout of the room is rather strange, which is also consistent with the U-shaped overall design of the hotel.
related. The facilities are generally outdated. The swimming pool is 0.93m-1.2m, which is too shallow for adults. When you swim to the shallowest place, your knees can directly hit the tiles below. Moreover, half of the swimming pool is reserved for a group of children who teach outside. If there are four residents swimming at the same time, it will be very crowded.

The surrounding area is very lively, with the famous Wulin Night Market, and nearby Hangzhou restaurants such as Xinbailu and Dongdafang, making it convenient for eating, drinking and having fun.
The five-star hotel rated by the National Tourism Administration in 2016 is very grand. Although the equipment and carpets are a bit old, the hospitality of the staff is pleasant. The hotel has a dedicated guest service ambassador, and this time it was Fiona who served us. On the morning of the check-in day, I called to inquire about the approximate arrival time, preferences, etc. I upgraded the room and gave free fruit cakes. After checking out, I asked for advice in a timely manner. Although I had never met, I felt very cordial and must give a five-star praise. The girl at the front desk is also very kind and professional. I like it very much. Including the lady at the coffee bar in the lobby, she enthusiastically introduced the hotel’s pastries and bought walnut cakes, which are homemade in the hotel and are indeed delicious.
The mountain view room is very spacious and faces Baoshu Tower. The bathroom is also large and fully equipped. The room is also equipped with a coffee machine, tea making utensils, etc., which are all available. Only old five-star hotels have such complete configurations. The breakfast is more Western-style and has a rich variety, which I like. The security guard was also enthusiastic and told us that the car number needs to be reported so that we can enter and exit freely. The price is similar to the hotel in Hangzhou where I originally wanted to stay, but the price/performance ratio is better ~

There were so many times and there were so many advantages: it was so close to the West Lake and very convenient, there were many delicious food options nearby, and there was also a similar hotel There are many things for children to play in the Youth and Children's Center, and you can see pirate ships swinging in the room. In addition to these, I am also very satisfied with the hotel's service. When checking in, there are foreign staff at the front desk who give snacks to the children, which is very user-friendly. After these two important events, I still chose Hangzhou as my first place to relax, and I still chose Wyndham. Although it has been so many years, the hotel service is still very satisfactory. Before checking in, I had hotel service ambassador Fiona contact me in advance. I contacted and arranged a suitable room according to the customer's requirements. When I entered the hotel, I smelled the scent I liked very much. It was very comfortable and the elevator was very fast. I didn't have to wait for a long time. The room staff would greet the guests when they saw them in the corridor. Although the facilities in the room are a bit outdated, the shower and bath water are still quite large, and the bed in the room is still very soft. If there was a small incident in the middle, they quickly and proactively helped me solve it. I am very satisfied, and my family is also very satisfied. The Wulin Night Market nearby is very lively at night and has a lot of food. You can go shopping in the evening. I felt very happy when I opened the balcony in the room and looked at the scenery outside. I was too rushed this time. Next time I have a longer vacation, I will still choose Wyndham. I will never let the guests down.

I have stayed in this hotel for many years and the service facilities have always been good. But this time it was very disappointing, even infuriating. I checked in at noon and it was very hot in the room. I turned on the air conditioner for 4 hours and it couldn't cool down. Instead, it went from 26 degrees to 28 degrees. I called the staff at night and said that the air conditioner was not working very well. They asked us to wait patiently and said that they could provide us with an independent air cooler. As a result, the air cooler was useless. The temperature did not cool down overnight. It was 28 degrees at night, and the family and their children did not have a good sleep. Very very bad experience.

The most irritating thing is that the next day we learned that due to the city's environmentally friendly air conditioning temperature restrictions, the hotel actually did not turn on the air conditioning at all. This means that the hotel staff deceived the guests and asked us to wait patiently. In fact, the hotel air conditioning The master control is not turned on at all. So disappointing and infuriating. We asked to communicate with the manager on duty, but the front desk refused to let us talk to the manager directly.

In addition, the room facilities are really old and shabby, and the crib bumpers provided are also shabby.

It really goes against the room charge of more than 1,000 yuan and the name of a five-star standard hotel. Absolutely lightning proof! Absolutely lightning proof! Absolutely lightning proof! ! !

msg:First time staying here, will not stay again.
Before checking in, I communicated with the front desk about arranging a quiet room not facing the street, but I was assigned a room in front of the elevator and facing the main road, which was very noisy.
The room settings are extremely old and the smell in the room is very strong.
There was a constant banging sound in the room, which was very loud and disturbed my sleep.
After breakfast started, most of the items were gone, the waiter wouldn't cook them, and the noodle cooking machine was broken.
On the night of check-in, I found supplies on the bedding. I contacted the hotel front desk, but no one answered the phone. The next day, I contacted the hotel to deal with the problem. The hotel actually said that it was caused by me eating in the room. They also asked me to provide an inspection certificate to prove that it was not the hotel's problem. They also said that I could complain to the regulatory agency.
This is the attitude of a five-star hotel. This is the first time I've seen it.

Hotel service: Cool! I didn’t see the smiling faces of the service staff in the hotel for two nights... I booked two rooms, and the child lived in the other room. I forgot to bring the room card and came out. I called the front desk to help open the room. After confirming the information, I was urged for nearly 40 Minutes to come to open the door! Another time I took Xiaobao (9 months) out and came back. The baby felt uncomfortable. The hotel where the father arrived first did not have a room card. He asked the front desk to help open the door, but the front desk did not open it! Do not open! Do not open! This is so speechless!

Will not live in this hotel again!

1. On the day of check-in, the doorman or security guard at the gate is indifferent
2. The 1.3 meter mountain view twin room is specially selected, and the price is higher than the ordinary twin room. I found a 1.1-meter mattress on a 1.3-meter bed, and I called the front desk n times without saying anything. Two hours later, the waiter withdrew the small mattress (the waiter informed that the mattress had shrunk). ridiculous
3. Call at 12:10 to ask for check-out, and check-out cannot be delayed. It took a long time to suffer because there are children who can check out at 13 o'clock.
Bad review! !

I really don’t know what the hotel wants. You are a five-star hotel , It doesn't meet the star rating and price at all. too poor.
Environment: It is relatively close to the West Lake, and it takes about ten minutes to walk. This hotel is worth more than 1,000 nights, and it may only be worth the location.
Service: Generally, the waiters don't say hello very much.
Catering: Too bad, there are more than 200 people in the buffet, there is nothing to eat, the ingredients are not very fresh, the family members shook their heads and said it was bad, no wonder no one went to eat. Breakfast is also average.

In the early stage of check-in, it is required that the twin beds can be combined into a large bed on the platform, and a room that can jump far without shelter is arranged. The room type given also meets the requirements, so the experience is very good.
The rooms are large, all have balconies, and the sound insulation is very good.
The bed, quilt, and pillows fit very well and sleep well. The quilt is moderately thick, and there is no sound when it is turned.
The location of the hotel is very good, the bus, subway, night market, and West Lake scenic spot are within walking distance.
The only downside is the in-room dining. The quality and taste of the dishes are too poor. As a star hotel, it should not be good and needs to be improved.

The hotel is very close to the scenic spot of West Lake. It is just a road away from the scenic spot of West Lake. It is just across the road from Wulin Night Market. It is very convenient to eat, so you don't have to worry about eating and drinking. The room is clean and hygienic, spacious and has a balcony with a view of the mountains.

It is a pedestrian street when you go out, and you can walk two steps to the West Lake, but the printing fee is relatively expensive, 8.8 per sheet, and it is distressing to print six contracts.

1. Breakfast ends at 10:30. I went to eat at 10:08, but a lot of things were gone and I basically didn’t eat much.
2. When I was having breakfast, the cleaning lady was using a vacuum cleaner next to me. Because it was the next table and very close, I felt that the dust would fly into my plate.
3. My friend came to the hotel to see me. While waiting for me on the first floor, he wanted to use the toilet on the first floor. As a result, there was no paper in the toilet.
4. The sofa in the room has hair and is not clean.

I think these experiences are very bad. These phenomena should not appear at a 5-star hotel.

The hotel facilities can be seen as old-fashioned. We provide welcome fruit, drinks and beer in the refrigerator You can also drink for free, and you can also make coffee. But I hope the hotel can bring you a better check-in experience. The bed sheets are washed and torn and are still being used More consideration is given to the experience of staying and the feelings of the guests. Overall, the location is good, but the check-in experience is not good. ps: I drove here this time, there are a lot of people in West Lake, and there is a lot of traffic jams. The hotel parking is free, 👍 but there is a lot of traffic jams. This time, I rented Hello’s electric car for a whole day. It’s so convenient. I recommend it to everyone Everyone.

The hotel said it was renovated in 2016, but the facilities inside are like 2000 That kind of decoration style, outdated facilities, and a lot of dust, it feels similar to staying in a hotel, with a large gap. I expected to stay in Hangzhou for two consecutive days, but I couldn't help but check out and change to another hotel the next day. By the way, the children wanted to go swimming in the swimming pool of the hotel, but they went in and looked at it. In the locker room, the ceiling on the shower room was covered with large areas of black mildew, and the toilet pockets were full of stains. The hygiene of the hotel is really worrying.

You can jump in line if you want, and no one reminds you of the allocation. The most exaggerated thing is that after checking in, the waiter can freely enter the room. He also said that it is a normal process and he can enter the room if no one answers the door. Do you understand the premise? Checked in or not checked in? Is this the service level of a five-star hotel? They also shirked responsibility without even a single apology.

Room type: There is a large balcony facing Baojiao Tower. Large bathroom and bathtub, large mirrors, warm lighting distribution.

Bedding: very comfortable mattress, I believe it has been selected, each bed is equipped with two pillows of different heights and firmness. The texture of the fabric is very good, and the hygiene is in place. sleep bonus

Infrastructure: Although it has been open for 7 years since 2016, it is well maintained and not very old. The hotel atrium is quite distinctive in the cruise ship.

The customer service staff is in place.

🧐🧐The following are minefields to help consumers clear mines:

There is a western restaurant buffet in the hotel. If you use the room number on Saturday night, the price will be 230 per person after discount. The buffet is very rough, the quality is not very good, there are few categories, and it is very casual. It is even more expensive than the buffet in Guangzhou which is about 100 yuan. After eating the buffet, the whole person is unhappy, and the impression of the hotel is greatly reduced.
If someone asks me if it is worth eating a buffet, I will definitely say NO! Ordering a takeaway is better than him👍

msg:For this trip, I finally chose to stay at Wyndham. On the one hand, it is because of its excellent location, and on the other hand, it is aimed at the old-fashioned hotel and the five-star service standard.
I was not disappointed. Yun Duo has already arranged all the things, such as children's utensils, slippers, heating in the room, etc., before the person arrives in the store. Because I was afraid of noise, I reserved a very quiet room for me. Very kind message also received. Very warm and thoughtful. Praise Yunduo and thank Yunduo.
The room was cleaned very well. If there is any need, the housekeeping depar**ent will deliver it within 1 minute, which is very efficient. Our room is also very clean.
Check-in and check-out are very efficient.
Great!
Will continue to choose next time.

I didn't expect to find out that there are night markets and many well-known restaurant chains just a few steps away, so that I can visit scenic spots during the day and eat at night. Of course, it may be because of these reasons that the roads near the hotel have been relatively congested, and the parking spaces are also very tight. I would like to remind friends who drive here. Finally, I would like to commend Lucy, the guest relations manager of the hotel, who accompanied me all the way through the cloud, helped me arrange and upgrade the room in advance, greeted me proactively during my stay, and responded to every request.

1. One day before check-in, call the hotel front desk to make an appoin**ent for the next day's buffet. The front desk said to transfer me to the restaurant, but the restaurant didn't answer for a long time, so the front desk said to record my call and ask the restaurant to call back. Haven't had a call yet.
2. Entering the room, there is a toothpick on the coffee table, which is very conspicuous. After responding to the front desk, it was said that someone would be arranged to clean it up. Waited for more than 1 hour, no one came. After cleaning up by yourself, give feedback to the front desk. Later, the lobby manager called to apologize, and I would like to express my thanks!
3. The experience of swimming and fitness is extremely poor! Feeling disrespected at all! I told the fitness front desk staff (a man with a northeast accent, not wearing work clothes) that we are hotel guests, and he randomly took out a registration form and asked me to write the room number on the blank space on the back. He didn't take the initiative to give me the key to the locker. I asked for the key, and he said he wanted a mortgage. I gave him the room card and he gave me a key. Because there is a woman in the same company, I said I would trouble you to give me another key, but he said that a collateral is still needed. I really can't understand it. If we are hotel guests, it should be enough to give you a room card. Besides, you won't bring a lot of things when you go swimming. The other party said impatiently, how do I know that you haven't returned it yet. Later, I found that I was wearing a watch. In desperation, I had to take off the watch and mortgage it. After swimming, found that there are no towels provided, had to have towels sent from the hotel room.

And told me to tell her before I come next time, she will make arrangements in advance to ensure that I am satisfied with my stay! Just for this, it has to be a five-star rating

msg:The Wyndham Hotel pretending to be on a 'cruise trip'
🌟Environmental facilities: I have always wanted to experience this Wyndham Hotel located by the West Lake, which is shaped like a "butterfly 🦋". It happened that there was a promotion two days after the festival, 500 yuan per night, so I decided to place an order and make an appoin**ent Check in. On the day of arrival, the car goes directly to the parking lot on the second floor of the basement 🅿️, the elevator goes to the front desk on the first floor, when you check in, ask if you can upgrade? The staff surnamed Tao reported to the duty manager and confirmed that the room was vacant, and the room was upgraded from the fifth floor below to a 50-square-meter room on the sixth to ninth floors for free. During the period, the staff surnamed Tao reminded ⏰ This promotion provides minibar drinks, but breakfast is not included. I'll take a closer look, and it's true! I did not pay attention to this aspect when purchasing, I thought it would be included! After the staff surnamed Tao reported to the manager, they promised to send two breakfasts for free! This service is awesome! give it a like! Check in the room, swipe the elevator card to locate the floor to ensure mutual non-disturbance and safety. The room is big, especially the bathroom, which is very spacious. However, due to the history of more than ten years, the bathtub 🛁 has poor drainage and the facilities are a bit old. The carpet is grey and somewhat dirty.
🌟 Restaurant: In the restaurant on the second floor, the breakfast is rich in variety, the fruits are very fresh, and there are five flavors of yogurt, which is very good!
⛱Parking: Free in hotel, underground parking 🅿️
🌟Location and Transportation: Bus 🚌130, 25, 78, 49, 186, 10 and get off at No. 14 Middle School Station; walk for more than 100 meters from Exit F of Fengqi Road Station of Metro Lines 1 and 2.
🌟 Swimming pool: none
🌟 Gym: negative first floor
💰Consumption: about 800 yuan
📌Tips: Close to Wulin Night Market and West Lake, you can visit

Only the hotel elevator is cool enough. of. I responded to the front desk and thanked him for giving me a fan that was whirring in the room. With the sound of the air conditioner, the room was as noisy as the computer room. I really tied Q. Is this really a 5 star hotel? More than 1500 a day on this? How does the room look like there is no 37-45 square meters? There is no place to put the suitcase on the TV cabinet. I really tied the Q. However, the hotel service is still at a five-star level. I can see that the front desk is doing everything possible to make my stay more comfortable. But really, I have never sweated so much in a five-star hotel in my life and put the boxes No less. I took it. Even if you have more than 20 square meters in a quarantine hotel in Hong Kong, you can still run around in the room and empty your Hangzhou to this point? The hotel management asks you to remember that customers spend almost 1600 a day staying in the hotel not to help you save energy. Energy saving is very important, but when someone is really living, be generous. The air conditioner is turned on two or three degrees, and it will not cost a few dollars in the room. I really won't come again, and I also recommend that people who come to Hangzhou in the summer are really, if you feel that the suitcase is more than 28 degrees and can't fit in your suitcase, you can stay here. I'm really tied to Q. Squishy room My first time in a 5 star hotel with allergies + sleeping sweaty. I'm really tied to Q.

The waiters at the front desk were very poor. They didn't provide toiletries at check-in. The aunt said why they didn't give them, so they hurried to get them. They actually gave two bottles of shower gel instead of shampoo.
I booked a room for two days without breakfast, and told me to go to the dining bar to buy 194 yuan on-site and 154 yuan at the front desk, so I bought two copies, and even paid a deposit of 1,500 yuan on the spot. I went to the dining bar the next day and told you that there was no breakfast and no breakfast. Seeing the purchase application record, waiting for him to repeatedly check and communicate at the entrance and exit, that embarrassing!
I ordered a room for two consecutive days, but the room card could not be used the next day, so I went to the front desk to swipe the card again. The waiter worked for a while, and then took the card to communicate with another guest. Continue to communicate again, and give it to me after the second operation, that fire!
For the corridor lights in the room, the main switch must be turned off, and the corridor lights are turned off. There is no independent switch, and the bedside charger cannot be used after it is turned off, and the night light cannot be used either.
Bad review!

When I checked the renewal at the front desk, the staff said it was a cheaper renewal price. The order was canceled, where should I go to book it, I should also inform that the renewal was successful, and the room card can be used normally. At 4:00 pm, I called and said that the renewal was not successful, so I re-booked at the current price of 819 on Ctrip. At that time, the renewal was 669 today. The amount of the cancelled order was 679, what is it, there is no way to go there, there is no confirmation, the order is cancelled. I just wanted to ask why the order didn't confirm why you are renewing your stay, the room card can be used, why did you tell the guests that the hotel has activities for three consecutive days and you can check in at 669, I thought it was a good intention, but it turned out to be a trap, your hotel is poor Is this more than 100, is this not a fraud? After communication, it was not resolved, and I decided to check out. This hotel is not recommended.

It is better to ask a cleaning aunt to be at the door. Second, poor sanitary conditions, dirty bedding. Third, the facilities are outdated. 4. Half of the hotel buildings are rented apar**ents, and many are sold properties. That is to say, the tenants, the owners renovate, and the hotel guests are in the same building. 5. During the day, the next room is being renovated, and it keeps knocking on the wall. Serious noise.
To sum up: This hotel is called a five-star hotel, and it charges five-star prices. In fact, it provides services that are not as good as apar**ents.

After reporting the problem to the hotel staff, I felt that there was no sincerity~ anyway, it was too bad~! ! !

The front desk brother Lan Jianlong, the little brother at the luggage store, and the cleaning lady are all very nice. The only unsatisfactory thing is that the facilities are relatively old. The interior of the room is a bit smelly. . Overall the price/performance ratio is fairly high

Software: Breakfast buffet, it is important to say three times, self-service, full self-service, self-service, there is really no one to serve, but the package is worthy of praise, and the staff of the lead office remembers the needs of the guests.
The other is the security guards at the door, who are utterly defiant and don't know where the courage comes from. If you say rush people, you will rush people. The car is parked in the hotel area for one night. There is no problem. As a result, guests check out and rush people immediately. Is this kind of behavior too bad, without any sense of service, why do you still work in the service industry?
The lobby manager does not have the ability to solve problems, nor does he have the courage. He does not understand the current foreign chain chain, since the service is so bad~
Make complaints
Every employee in Hangzhou West Lake State Guest House has a sense of service. Facts have proved that corporate culture is very important.

msg:這是我在杭州體驗感最差的一家酒店，首先入住的一整個下午樓上都在施工，吵得沒辦法好好休息，後來跟服務員溝通説不是酒店內部施工，他們也協調過沒有辦法，衹能作罷！到了晚上，空調衹有熱風，開了跟在桑拿房一樣，關了空調又很悶，就讓服務員拿了電風扇，夜裡還是熱，被子很厚，一夜沒睡好！早上速速退房再也不會來這家酒店了！

msg:1、酒店位置非常好：出後門過馬路就是西湖，離斷橋和湖濱步行路都不遠，酒店樓下不遠就是小吃一條街，離白鹿杭州菜特色店非常近。
2、酒店房間空間不小，佈局比較合理舒適，房間設施也可以，維護保養的sh屬於一般情況。
3、早餐一般，品質不多，可選擇行不大，建議改進。
4、總體而言，對於五星級酒店，不算出色和優秀，中等水平。
5，建議餐飲、服務和自助餐進一步改進和提高。

這是傢什麼樣的酒店。。。 完全沒有服務意識，一個旅遊城市就是這麼提供服務的麼？！

酒店雖然外觀看上去有點略舊，但裏面的軟硬件都還不錯，相對於這個價格來説性價比沒問題。
有點遺憾的杭州的天氣確實對出行影響挺大的，第二天我們另外找了一家更親近自然的酒店，敬請期待。

또 프론트 직원은 꽤 불친절했고, 저의 질문에 코웃음치는 듯한 반응이 조금은 불쾌하기도 했습니다. 머리에 곱슬기가 심한 직원이었습니다. 

위치가 좋고 저녁부페 맛있고 부페 식당이 굉장히 친절했고 조식도 괜찮아서 다음번에 방문의사가 있습니다. 
그치만 프론트 직원교육과 방의 청결도,시설관리에 더욱 신경을 쓸 필요가 있어 보입니다.

如果你來杭州、我真心推薦你住温德姆豪廷至尊酒店，印象中應該是我第一次主動在某程上給商家寫好評。剛到房間因為點小問題給前台打電話，這名工作人員超有耐心的幫我解決問題，前前後後樓上樓下幫我跑了好幾次，直到我滿意為止，看了他的工牌，他叫劉家樂，這種服務到極致的細緻和熱情徹底打動了我。第二天從大堂經過看他依舊忙碌的身影，十一假期遊客增多，工作之餘多注意休息呀。當一個酒店，服務、人情味，硬件設施，都沒問題的時候，那他一定是你旅行中的一個亮點和記憶點[愛心]

酒店設施:十幾年的酒店還是比較完善，但是房間裏面的布草非常差，毛巾非常硬，素質還有很多毛須！五星級酒店，房價在一千左右的房間居然是這樣的。
服務態度:不敢恭維，甚至懷疑這些員工有沒有經過專業的素質培訓和專業培訓沒有。前台工作人員甚至把客户正常訴求和私隱一點都不尊重。隨便撥打客户的個人手機。

不過 我是下午五點辦理入住的

但是我在辦理入住的時候
有很多的人在對着辦理入住的小哥投訴
説  等了一天了居然也沒拿到房卡
衹因為突如其來的人流讓酒店措手不及
我就先把行李寄存出去逛步行街和就餐去了
在晚餐時 我和兒子談到了此事
説實話 三年疫情 酒店估計衹能減少人員了
沒想到突然的放開 一下全國各地的旅遊城市一下就爆滿
酒店經理沒有做好應急方案
唉
三年
酒店 飯店都挺難的  相互理解吧
所以 我覺得我入住時值班的前台小夥子真的值得加薪
面對來自客人的各種抱怨 一聲沒坑

msg:温德姆已經不是第一次入住了，一如既往的恰好。最喜歡這張大床了，每次一躺下去就想好好的睡覺，實在太解壓。
這一次真的要好好的感謝一下LUCY，還沒入住，就幫我們搞定了房間，中午過去開房，很多人都要等到下午兩點以後才能入住，我們直接拿房卡入住，關鍵還免費升級！最為貼心的是，退房的時候，剛好小朋友困了，想要午睡，於是LUCY又幫我免費延遲到下午三點才退房，想客人之所想，很贊！
來杭州，毫不猶豫，繼續温德姆。

msg:每年都要來杭州，每次都喜歡住不同的酒店
這次斟酌了半天，最終選擇了我們覺得性價比最高的温德姆至尊豪庭
不管是從地理位置還是硬件設施上都滿足我們的要求
讓我意外的是，入住前一天，客房部的Chole就聯繫我確認入住需求
我們帶了一個精力旺盛的娃，所以希望房間可以大一點能讓娃撒歡
Chole很爽快我就幫我們安排了大一點的房間
並在入住當天中午就告知房間已經準備好，我們11點到的杭州
本來還想拖着箱子小逛一圈再去酒店，看到房間已經準備好就直奔酒店啦~
房間除了裝修稍微舊一點以外都非常符合預期
酒店的早餐也非常豐富，必須要提一句“紅燒牛肉麪很好吃！”
電視可看的內容選擇也很多~不要管小朋友的時候放她看電視就行
重點是地理位置真的很好，離西湖就一條馬路，出門就是武林夜市~
離開酒店這天因為下雨，火車時間又比較尷尬，不高興拖着箱子到處逛了，
就問了Chole能否辦理下延遲退房，依然是很爽氣的答應啦~印象分再次UP！
對酒店其實還挺挑剔的家屬説以後就訂這裏啦！

從停車場開始，到處是亂停的車沒人指揮，第一印象就很不好。
到了大廳辦理入住，一堆人在抱怨等房太久，2點多還不能入住衹能理解為酒店沒有給春節做好足夠預案。
還有就是酒店確實老了，對我來説最致命的就是隔音實在實在太差了，睡眠不是很好的遊客自己注意吧。房間裏小孩跑步的聲音，各種房門關門的聲音，早上樓道里遊客的聲音，簡直是折磨。
早飯水準達不到五星標準，衹能説湊合管飽。
當然，酒店也是有優勢的。那就是地理位置，出門到夜市和西湖都是步行距離。
肯定也是唯一的優勢了。酒店服務人員態度是誠懇的，奈何吐槽點確實多了點。

msg:提幾個入住實際體驗與建議希望改進：
1. 下午3點半到前台辦入住，帶着兩個孩子在大廳等待近一小時，拿到房卡後上樓，房間還在打掃，又在附近備用房間等待了近半小時。
2.免費歡迎水果沒有看到。
3.入住時告知酒店車牌號，並得到回覆可以隨時出入，到離開酒店時出停車場被卡，明顯酒店沒把車牌號登進系統，造成尷尬與時間的浪費。
4.親子主題房居然沒有可以贈送的小禮物，且毛絨玩具等都略顯陳舊。
春節期間可以理解，但作為國際知名酒店確實值得改善。

設施也不錯。
需要提兩點建議：
1.洗髮水和沐浴露應該升級下；
2.給的我們靠北臨街的，有個小陽台很棒，但是陽台那裡的門窗漏風啊，趕上那天降温還是挺冷的。
忘拍照片了，但已安利朋友。

最重要の是私人小助理Lucy幾乎全程服務關心，還沒有入駐就關心我們行程，入駐後主動諮詢有沒有什麼需要幫助，替客户排憂解難就是最好最有效の服務！
