msg:I think this is my favorite hotel in Guangdong province 😊
Ok, maybe it is a bit remote location, far from bustling city center and not much around, but: very close to the airport, a very new building, beautifully designed rooms, very comfortable beds, calming view from the window. The staff is very professional, polite, English speaking, and more importantly: welcoming you with a friendly smile, which is not common in Chinese hotels. 
Thus, if you want to treat yourself with a bit of luxury before an early morning flight, or plan to visit Xiamen for a couple of days and relax after all day exploring the city – I would definitely recommend it.

Staffs doesn’t sound polite, impatient when ask more infor on how to make the aircon works.  Breakfast is terrible, no oats or muesli in terms of western breakfast.  Sweet potato is cut into small parts instead of the whole sweet potato that presented, thus the sweet potato turn black making it looks not appealing. Will never stay at Courtyard by Marriott again.

Facilities: The lobby bar is very spacious and has an outdoor area; the swimming pool and gym are both sea views, the view is very comfortable, and they are also quite large, and the equipment is quite complete.

Service: I asked the front desk whether I could upgrade or delay check-out, but there was no way, which is understandable; but there was no robot to deliver the takeaway, and there was a takeaway table at the entrance of the lobby, and the guests had to call the front desk to arrange it.

The service is also very good, I highly recommend the scones at the lobby bar for afternoon tea~
The disadvantage is that the takeout is only left at the door, and there is no robot to deliver it.
The transportation is inconvenient and the takeout cannot be taken upstairs. This is really discouraging... Also, is there really air conditioning in the room? A bit stuffy…
If you just want to go out and relax and want to be alone, it is quite recommended. You can go downstairs and go to the beach for a walk.

The room was extremely hot and stuffy. It woke me up from the heat at night. I couldn't sleep well at all. I was curious about how big it was. The hotel's air conditioner was reluctant to turn on. The cleaning lady said that the air conditioner was not turned on and it was just natural wind. She also brought me an electric fan, but the hotel front desk lied to us and said that the air conditioner was on. Haha... 760 The air conditioner was not turned on all night. This is the worst thing. The experience should indicate that there is no air conditioning in the hotel, so I won’t be sure.

The bathrobes in the pictures are very disgusting. I didn't expect the hygiene to be poor. At this point, first of all, the bathrobe was not washed, and secondly, I seriously doubted whether the bed sheets and quilt covers were also not washed.
The most important thing about a hotel is hygiene. This stay was a very poor experience.

This is an objective review, I just hope that other travelers will not be deceived into staying in this hotel.

When it was 15 o'clock, it was said that the room had not been cleaned and it would take about half an hour. I asked at 1530, but the reply was still not good. Seeing that I was standing at the front desk, the staff did not know where to get me a room on the 5th floor (it was originally said to be on the 7th floor), so I could barely accept it. (If you don't want it, I don't know when I can move in).
Although the location of the hotel is close to the airport, it is relatively remote. There are no commercial and residential areas around. If you like quiet and few people, you can consider this hotel. The only advantage of the hotel is that it faces the sea, but the room has no balcony and can only be seen through the glass. The facilities are relatively new, the breakfast on the 2nd floor is OK, and the swimming pool on the 3rd floor is quite clean.
As of the time I wrote the review, the deposit has not been returned to me! (22 hours have passed since I checked out, and when I returned, it was said that it would be refunded to me on the same day)

Near the airport, very quiet. We went to Jiageng Park not far from the hotel in the evening to see the sea. There were few people and it was very comfortable.

However, Xiamen is not big, so it is very convenient to take a taxi to other places.
The Chinese food in the full-time restaurant on the second floor of the hotel is good. We are not used to eating Western food. We ordered it once, and it was almost useless. It was a waste. The fly in the oin**ent is that the serving speed is a bit slow.
The breakfast is moderately rich.

The smell of the elevator and corridor is not the same as that of the lobby, the elevator smells of smoke, and the corridor smells bad. Standards of execution need improvement. The elevator door on the wall in the public area does not look very clean, and the cleaning is sloppy! It has lost the standard of Marriott. The floor tiles in the room are cleaned but always look dirty. The floor of the shower room is not cleaned uniformly and has a bit of a smell. The sound insulation of the room is average. Generally speaking, cleaning needs rectification. The breakfast variety is quite satisfactory. good service. The view from the sea view room is also good. Close to the airport, not so busy.

The security master at the door provided excellent service. When I parked at the door, I directly helped carry the luggage to the front desk for registration. The service staff at the front desk It's also very nice, the hotel lobby is very spacious, and there is a beautiful eating, drinking and resting area in the lobby. The equipment and facilities in the room are very new, and the sanitation and cleaning are very good. The best thing is the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room. You can feel the invincible sea view after waking up in the morning It's really great, if you don't want to go to other attractions the next day, you still want to stay in this hotel, you must stay in this hotel next time

This Courtyard is very cost-effective and clean and hygienic is basic. The bonus is that the sea view is super beautiful! ! unexpected surprise! ! The service facilities of the hotel are very complete and the usage time of the swimming pool and gym is also very suitable. It is the first choice for friends who like hotel-style travel hahaha. The service of the guy at the front desk is considerate and thoughtful. This will be my first choice hotel next time I come to Xiamen.

msg:I booked a sea view room during the Dragon Boat Festival. Compared with other five-star hotels on the island, this hotel is closer to the airport and quieter (in fact, Xiamen Island is not too big, and the transportation is very convenient, so you don’t necessarily need to live in Siming District). The service attitude is very good, the staff can always find your needs, and the attitude of the staff is also very comfortable. It is not the general five-star business style, but it makes people feel relaxed and friendly on vacation. The booked sea view room has a good view, the room is big and clean. The overall decoration is new and simple

This time, you can go to the executive lounge on the 12th floor to enjoy drinks and snacks when you stay in the executive room type. Light meals are also provided after 5:30 pm. The view from the room is very good, as soon as you open the window you can look at the blue sea. The room equipment is also very complete, and the front desk is happy to help if you need anything.

msg:I rarely write reviews on five-star hotels, but today I have to complain about the poor service and experience.
1. The hotel hair dryer cannot work for a long time. It will overheat and fail to work after 2-3 minutes of operation.
2. Someone was singing in the hotel in the middle of the night. The hotel stated that because of external merchants, the hotel could not interfere and could only wait until the singing outside ended, which directly affected sleep.
3. The service provided by the front desk is really not worthy of the hotel's five-star standard: we booked an executive king-bed room and needed a room for us to put on makeup and go out when we checked in early. After we described the situation, the hotel front desk insisted on keeping our luggage at the front desk. Don’t you understand that the front desk of a five-star hotel cannot be flexible and flexible to meet customer needs? The customer also needs to ask if there are any available rooms of other room types for us to use first. When we were about to find a vacant room, the front desk reluctantly told us that we would come back and change rooms at that time. We asked the front desk if they couldn't provide luggage porter service? A normal 4-star hotel can provide it. Does a five-star hotel still need to take the initiative to provide it? The price is too low and the front desk service is not worthy of five-star standards.

Disadvantages: The shower room was blocked, and later it was discovered that the guest room was not cleaned thoroughly. The previous guest's hair blocked the floor drain, and the guest room was not cleaned properly. In addition, the front desk service at night was not in place and it took 10 minutes to connect the phone. Instead of apologizing first, the customer service found reasons to explain the reason. This kind of service that cannot think about the problem from the customer's perspective is also shocking. Third, the hotel is positioned as a business hotel, the breakfast categories are very limited, and the meal replenishment is not timely.

msg:I have stayed at several Marriott and Renaissance hotels. When I came to the Courtyard this time, I could clearly feel the gap in service. The front desk was very embarrassed when checking in because I was upgrading my room. I can understand that this is an additional requirement, but even if you are upgrading your room or not, you should do it. Tell us in a calm manner, rather than looking down upon us as if we are taking advantage. The hotel hardware is very good, the staff in the lobby bar and the housekeeping staff are very polite and well-educated. The breakfast is small but refined, with everything you need. It's understandable that the air conditioner was turned off after breakfast to save electricity, but the swimming pool was closed due to the typhoon. When communicating on the phone, I took a tough stance and said that the closure was an emergency request from the government and not the hotel's problem. Speaking is an art, and a 5-star hotel should have standard service standards.

msg:服務態度不行 在阿姨打掃過後丟了一件衣服 多次詢問前台無果 就回復一句我們這邊的阿姨説沒看見 我們也沒有辦法 你們再回去找找看 那我肯定是在尋找多次的情況下沒找到才諮詢前台 並告知前台續住了 叫阿姨打掃順便再幫我找找看那件衣服 等回到房間發現沒有打掃的痕跡 一片臟亂

環境：整體裝修風格很簡潔明亮，但細節（比如窗户把手）有被損壞未修繕
服務：服務非常好，前台和餐廳的服務人員都很友善且響應客户要求的速度很快

總體來説，春節期間以這個價格攜家人住到海景房還是很快樂的！（推薦自駕遊噢，畢竟靠近機場，如果沒有自己的車車感覺出行不是很方便）
