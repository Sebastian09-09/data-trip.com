msg:Imperial Springs is a beautiful hotel set amongst a very serene Guangdong environment. Don't expect lots of busy activity here. Lots of quiet and it's often possible to not meet any other guests for hours at a time. The hot springs were peaceful and empty of people. There are staff on hand offering tea regularly. And it is open till late.

To get around the facility you will be driven by a butler. They are always friendly and helpful.

As a foreigner in China, I would say that Imperial Springs perfectly blends the experience of being in Guangdong, with aspects of staying in a hotel that will make a Westerner feel at home. I will be recommending it my colleagues and friends. 

There is both a Chinese food restaurant and a Western food restaurant. The Chinese restaurant did not have a menu available in English.

Of course the hotel is a little on the pricey side. A bit cheaper would make the whole experience feel a bit better for customers.

As always, it is the staff and people at a hotel that make the experience excellent. Ceci in the restaurant was very attentive and made sure I found some high quality food recommended from the chef. The hotel clearly employes highly professional catering staff.

Rako and Michael also gave an excellent welcome tour to the hotel and took the time to drive me around to see the beautiful scenery.

It turns out that hotel service can be so meticulous and considerate. Congdu Hotel has achieved this as long as you have reasonable requirements, the hotel can satisfy you. The service is a one-on-one private butler. Our gold medal butler received us with a badge and her name was He Liying. WeChat docking informed us of the precautions. She was already waiting for reception at the entrance of Congdu. The service is quite in place, not only does not affect the guests' stay, but it is also available 24/7. On call every hour, butler-style service. Wherever we go, the butler will drive a battery car to pick us up, explain and accompany us. The reception standards are very high, smiling and caring, making everyone feel at home.
Environment: The hotel covers a large area. It's like a maze when you enter. You can't find the southeast, northwest, and northwest. The environment is very beautiful. The entire manor is very grand, with fresh air, birds singing and flowers fragrant. It is styled in the Tang Dynasty and has a private outdoor hot spring.
Catering: The breakfast is rich and delicious, the Chinese food is delicious, and there are welcome fruits.
We feel: The Hidden World Hotel is really extraordinary. We have stayed in many hotels, but the service here is the best and the environment is quite beautiful. Whether it is the gold medal butler, restaurant waiter, lobby service staff, security and cleaning staff, etc., every time It once again made me feel warm and comfortable. Overall, there are no downsides other than the price and we would stay here again. Many thanks to all the hotel staff for their warm service!

Service: The security guard at the entrance to the capital will check the hotel reservation information to ensure that all guests are checking in. When arriving at the hotel lobby, the team will actively help carry luggage to the luggage cart, and the check-in procedure is also very smooth and fast. To go to the villa, you need to inform the staff at the hotel lobby to arrange a battery car to go there. Calling the electric car service can take you to various places in Congdu, including visiting the Phoenix Official Residence. It is now the peak season for hot spring vacations, so when calling for a battery car, I reserve time to call in advance, so the waiting time is relatively short. The lady on the battery car was also very enthusiastic in answering our questions on the way. During the peak occupancy period, there is a large flow of people for breakfast, so it is recommended to eat at off-peak hours. Breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western food, with a rich variety, including rice rolls, flour stalls, Mexican fish taco, fried eggs, etc. When checking out, the lady who took the electric car directly helped us check out quickly, and then sent us directly to the parking lot to put our luggage. The service was super good! Overall, the experience is greatüëçüèª

Hygiene: After arriving at the villa, the room was cleaned very clean, and the mini bar in the room was replenished in time. The cleaning staff are also very enthusiastic to inquire about needed items. Although the hotel opened in 2011, the overall maintenance effect is still very good, and there are no signs of being particularly old.

Environment: The environment around the villa is very quiet and the air is fresh.
Facilities: Although there are public hot springs in the facilities, the villas have 24-hour private swimming pools, hot springs, dry steam rooms, wet steam rooms and massage baths. Basically, you can enjoy them without leaving the villaüòé, eliminating the trouble of making reservations for public hot springs .

msg:The environment is generally good, the hot springs are great, the service staff are warm and polite, and the breakfast is rich. Let me talk about two small shortcomings. First, when I made a reservation, I made a note that I needed a birthday decoration. The hotel did it, but one of the birthday light signs did not light up. I don‚Äôt know if the battery was dead or broken. I was a little regretful when I took the photo. I hope to decorate it next time. After I checked, I found out that the apples in the welcome fruit placed in the living room had been chewed by squirrels or other small animals, so I didn‚Äôt dare to eat the fruits in the fruit plate. So overall the service is good, just needs to be checked more.

The spring pool is large enough and the temperature is suitable. The swimming pool is like a dream pool. You can swim comfortably for half an hour alone with just enough exercise. There is almost no smell of disinfectant water. The trees next to it will drop leaves onto the pool surface, adding a bit of natural flavor. The afternoon sunlight reflects from the pool surface to the wall, creating a sparkling and lively effect. There were elderly people traveling with us, and the lady and housekeeper at the lobby professionally took the initiative to provide small stools to facilitate getting on and off the car. The restaurant's hygiene work was also in place. The outdoors in the mountains is relatively humid, but the air conditioning in the room is strong enough, so mosquitoes are within an acceptable range. After all, there is plenty of greenery. Anyway, the family was very satisfied with the trip.

The concierge ceremony at the gate is in place. There are staff at each entrance of the underground garage to open the door and help with luggage. Third, the food is produced. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve eaten so much bread. For breakfast, I had a simple pork ribs Chencun noodles. My family said that the pork ribs were full of gluten-free meat. As a Guangzhou native, I really think shrimp dumplings and chicken feet are also good. Eating, the feeling of material is really not very considerate of cost. I also want to expand on other points: Although the hardware will age over time, but the service is too good, I feel that these small problems can be ignored. The room ordered in the early morning requires an extra bed, and there is no need for cumbersome phone confirmation. The extra bed has already been made when you check in. In the hot spring area, even the unlimited fruit is really not perfunctory at all. I have stayed in a lot of hotels, so I really pay attention to details. I feel that there are really many things worth mentioning here. Finally, Xu Zhenjiang, the hotel lobby manager, has a very good service.

1) The facilities in the hotel room are so backward that they are like a fast hotel. I haven‚Äôt seen a hotel in a long time that uses soap to wash hands. Isn‚Äôt it even willing to provide hand sanitizer? After using the soap once, I put it in a dish. The second time I used it, it took me a long time to dig it out and use it. It stuck to the small dish. I laughed to death. What era is it?

The room lights are even more interesting. When you turn on the lights in the whole house, they turn on, and when you turn off the lights in the whole house, they turn off. Is it difficult to set up independent control lights? ? ?
?

2) Although it is winter, everyone knows the weather in Guangzhou in December. It was still 27 degrees on the day we came. They turned on the heating in the whole building, which was stuffy and hot. I couldn't sleep at all. I asked them to adjust it, but they said they couldn't adjust it. The whole building is open.

3) The mattress is so soft and does not have enough support at all, making it very uncomfortable to sleep on.

4) Speaking of service, I was even more disappointed. They were not willing to give me an extra bottle of soda water in the room because I had a stomachache and needed soda water, but they told me that one bottle would be provided for each room, so they did not give it to me. This is so funny. Can you pick it a little more?

5) The service of the hot spring is also the same. Even the cheapest Coke and Sprite are not provided for free. A bottle is only 20 yuan when asked. Other hotels provide it for free. We heard that it is really a black line.

6) Several female waitresses on the battery car also had a very bad attitude. They didn‚Äôt even help us with our luggage. They were looking at their phones the whole time. Is this the kind of service attitude?

7) Two bowls of white rice cost 21 yuan, and the prices are comparable to those in Hong Kong.

Comprehensive evaluation: It is an express hotel with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 100 square meters. The setting is old, the layout is unreasonable, the air conditioner is still rumbling at night, the service attitude is poor, and there is no experience at all. There will be no next time.

The best service is that users have needs and they can perfectly meet their needs. Ok, the hotel has actually done this, including the small details that both the waiter and the lobby manager will trot over when the guest has a problem. The only funny thing is that I said I wanted to call a shuttle bus, and the waiter suggested that I walk there. In fact, walking is relatively close, but maybe changing it to a more acceptable statement will not be so easy to misunderstand. In other respects, it is more than one level better than almost all the hotels next door. I have lived in Dusit Taili‚Äôs Hilltop Villa and Linjiang in Bishuiwan, so I should have a say in it, and I will come again

What impressed me the most was Congdu's service. Whether it's the waiters in the breakfast restaurant, the service staff in the lobby, or the staff driving the battery car, I feel time and time again that the hotel service can be so meticulous and caring. For example, it was raining that day, and we wanted to take a walk in the hotel after checking out. The battery car was very busy during the check-out peak, and the lobby manager took the initiative to drive us there by himself. If you are busy, you can directly contact him on his mobile phone and he will come to pick us up üëçüèª. I have lived in many five-star hotels, but the service here is the best.

Guangzhou Congdu International Manor - backed by mountains and facing water, built on the mountain, looming among the mountains and jungles, with a grand scale, majestic buildings, pavilions and halls, all over the Phoenix Mountain, the aura of mountains and rivers, ancient buildings and new buildings, green pines The green cypresses are natural, the scenery is pleasant, and it is as beautiful as a picture scroll... Just as the new crown is raging, hot springs soak in hot springs, and people can't help themselves. This place is the best...

The manor is roughly divided into several parts: hot spring villa real estate with extremely low volume, mountain golf club, life and health management center, rare private museum and manor hotel

The hotel adopts the architectural style of the palace of the prosperous Tang Dynasty, which makes people feel like returning to Chang'an Daming Palace, where "nine days are closed and the palace is opened, and all nations are dressed and crowned". stand alone...

The hotel housing is called a suite, but it is actually a living room of a villa; the hotel housing is called a villa, but it is actually a palace courtyard.

The inside of the house is clean and tidy, with modern decoration and layout; outside the house, there are red flowers and green leaves, and the trails lead to tranquility. When you check in and go out, there are battery cars to pick you up, and the staff are polite and polite. The buffet breakfast is rich and delicious, and the health tea at the hot spring is good.

The children's playground in the Recreation Center is not big, but very cozy. üà∂Ô∏è Archery, swings, game consoles, table football, flying chess, catching dolls, etc. The gym and swimming pool are worth punching. Loved by kids üíï

The security guards are different and professionally trained; the customer service is warm and patient, and everything is properly arranged.

Here is the name and praise: Mr. Li Caike, a staff member of the Recreation Depar**ent, is a very nice person üëçüëç Helping me take care of three children during the day, draw, play chess and play game consoles, help us patiently retrieve the arrows that were shot out of the hospital, and take care of safety by the swimming pool at night Lifeguards teach students, while teaching children to swim, the attitude is very goodüëçüëç

There is also a female staff member named Lele who is serious and responsible for pick-up and drop-off, leaving a good impression.

The most worthy of recognition is that Liu Tingli, the beauty manager on duty at the front desk, helped me solve the difficulty of staying in a family of "two big and three small". , worthy of great praise üëç üëç üëç üëç üëç

There are also a few regrets: I didn't bring the royal photographer; I didn't see the presidential suite on the top of the mountain during the year-end event; I was only immersed in the mountains and rivers, and forgot to have a mini-bar experience coupon; I didn't come early, but I needed to check out after 12 o'clock. Without the normal delayed service...

Then save it for next time to make up for it...

The battery car is always used at the peak. The most interesting thing is that the do not disturb light is turned on and the door is opened by oneself. Big taboo!

It is very suitable for walking slowly with the elderly and breathing fresh air, but because I am not living in a suite, there is no swimming pool, and the hot spring only has 5 pools open, I don't think it is suitable. Parent-child, unless you book a room with a swimming pool or hot spring, but it is very suitable for the elderly. The most outstanding is that the service is very good, very satisfied. The service from the Capital Museum is also very good, but if you have the habit of visiting museums, I really don't recommend this. The price/performance ratio is super low.

If it is for hot springs, choose another hotel because there are only 5-6 hot spring pools here, and I think they are all warm water, and the hot springs are especially full of mosquitoes.

As a top local resort hotel, the breakfast is lackluster, and the variety is not even as good as that of an old hot spring hotel nearby. As for the service, it is quite satisfactory, but I forgot to place an order for green vegetables when ordering. No matter how good the hardware is, it is just amazing at first glance.

msg:The hotel environment is still very good. I didn't expect that there is such a place surrounded by mountains an hour and a half away from the city center. The room is big and the view is good, but the facilities are a bit old. We asked for a type B but the sauna was not hot enough. Next time, I will choose the cheaper A-type. The most expensive C-type has more swimming pools but cannot swim in winter, and the scenery on the first floor is not so good. If you want to have a private pool, you can only choose a villa, which is expensive, three or four times more expensive than other hotels with private pools, and it feels not worth it.
You have to take a battery car to and from the hot spring, and it is still a bit cold to take the car in winter. There are only six pools, so make an appoin**ent in advance. The temperature of the hot spring is too high, so you can't soak for too long.
In addition to the hot springs, other things are good. There is a wetland park in front of the hotel. You can also go to the Phoenix Residence and walk along the mountain road to inhale negative ions.
Food is a little expensive, you can go to a nearby farm to eat.

msg:The check-in experience is extremely bad. Don't go to check-in with great expectations. We had high expectations. We were so disappointed to see such equipment and services! The equipment in the room is aging and damaged, and there is no solution: the curtains are broken, the mirror TV next to the bathtub is also broken, and there are still traces of opening for more than 10 years. If you are young and like modern rooms, don't choose Congdu. Will definitely be disappointed. This place is only suitable for the older generation, because the air here is good, and greenery is the only advantage. suggestions below:
1. Improve the professionalism of employees and strengthen employee training: the professionalism of employees is worrying, and each service staff who answers the phone responds differently, making customers feel incomprehensible, and there is no clear plan and answer for inquiries, such as: (1) Handle at the front desk When I checked in, I asked twice whether there were 10 buildings, because I had a note when I placed the order that I wanted 10 buildings; the check-in staff at the front desk clearly told me that it was 10 buildings, but it was only 11 buildings when I checked in; (2) The waiting time for the room card Long, the room was cleaned at 14:40, and the room card was received at 15:30. The waiting time was too long; and I was told on the phone that I was on the 3rd floor. Knowing that it is on the 2nd floor, it proves that the staff does not have a clear enough understanding of the room number and the corresponding floor; (3) We have booked two rooms, one room type A and one room type B. The first room is 8608, and the first room is 8608. Check in at 8608 After (room type B), I took the initiative to call the customer service to ask whether another room could be arranged at 8609 next to our 8608 floor because it was a family trip. The first time I called customer service Miss A, she said that 8609 was of room type B, and I suggested that I could. Add money to make up the price difference to upgrade the room type; the second time I call customer service Miss B, she will reply 8609 as room type A, which is different from your choice. I tell you that I have booked room type A. The two customer service replies are different. So far, I still don't know whether 8609 is room type A or room B.
2. The equipment in the room is old, there is no complete solution to customer problems and there is no follow-up feedback: (1) The curtains next to the bathtub are broken and cannot be pulled up. Call customer service to deal with them. After returning to the room, it is found that the curtains are still damaged and have been photographed and recorded. ; (2) The mirror TV could not be turned on, so I called and contacted the tracking service later, but no one followed up; the two major equipment problems in the room were not properly dealt with.
(3) There is a lot of dust on the door handles of the room, and the details are not carefully handled.
3. Improve the MOT service, so that customers are surprised instead of disappointed. Seeing that we are holding the cake, we do not take the initiative to ask for help.

It can only be said that there are too many choices at this price. There is no need to choose a hotel that is more than 10 years old. Compared with the equipment and hardware, it is really old and outdated... I have repeatedly doubted that I am not staying in Congdu... I suggest you choose carefully... Don't give That's the name... hey, I'm so disappointed

msg:I looked for a guide made by a friend from a travel agency and found this manor. I was very satisfied. It is very suitable for family travel. This time it is the world of two people to feel it. The facilities are quite complete, there is a mini-bar, and the a-type villa, which is more cost-effective when you go. If you consider the family travel budget, I recommend a four-room villa. This time the hotel arranged a cake for us to celebrate the anniversary. The scene was very touching. The only downside was that the room location arranged by my hotel control was not good enough. Lilac Court was close to the road. It happened to be a wedding ceremony next door, so it was a bit noisy. And the privacy is not very good. There are residents on the left and right, so you will be more concerned about it when you go out to take a bath. This is my dissatisfaction. The villa is equipped with dry and wet steam, and we did not use it. Just soaked in the hot springs, and the swimming pool water is particularly good, there is a loose feeling...
The second is that the shower room is recommended to be equipped with non-slip mats, which should be really unsafe and almost slipped.
Third: the cloakroom light is dim.
If you have something to call the front desk, if you want to relax the time of the two souls, you, you and I would still recommend it.
The fourth is the question of eating. Only Cantonese and Western food are available. For those of us who often eat Cantonese food, it doesn't make sense to go there. There are very few western food people. If the team goes to eat, we will have to drive out to eat. It is recommended that it is perfect if it is accompanied by clean and tasteful farmhouse dishes! I visited a four-bedroom villa with a kitchen, and the customer service said that they can bring things to cook and have a mahjong table. A two-day stay is almost the same. If you want to live in a suite, it is also a good choice. A place to come next time!

In the Chinese restaurant, the chef is good and the food is delicious, especially the oyster porridge, but the number of service staff is not enough and the experience is so bad. How to put it all together, compared to other five-star hotels in Guangzhou, the environment is first-class, and the soft power of service is a little bit inferior. If there is the service of an international brand five-star hotel, it is first-class.

There are only CCTV and local stations, which means that TV is available. without. There are only a few hot spring pools. There are too many people and I visited it. I didn't go down to soak in. Breakfast is good. The room only has a cloakroom and a living room with tissue boxes, and they are extremely inconspicuous. The most satisfying is the area of the swimming pool and outdoor air and gardens.

msg:First of all, the hotel is quite big, and the breakfast value is the best. Unfortunately, you need to wait for the breakfast peak. The types are all the same, but the quality is very good. The fitness center has some free facilities for children to play (the doll needs to be paid), it is recommended Families with children book a room above Suite C, because the rooms above Suite C have a small swimming pool. Suites A and B do not have a swimming pool. Since the hotel room rates are so expensive, there is no need to book a room with a pool for children. Have fun. Secondly, other aspects of the hotel feel that it is not worth it. First of all, entry to the hotel museum is not free, you need to pay 70 yuan per person, and then bicycles are paid for use, single bicycle 80 yuan / hour, double 100 yuan / hour, hotel hot springs Sprite is 30 yuan/can, Sprite in the room is 10 yuan/can, I don‚Äôt know if the brand is different, why the price of the same hotel is different? In addition, I really dare not go to the hotel's Chinese restaurant. A pho 100+ is really unwilling to eat, so we drove 10 minutes to eat out for dinner. Finally, I hope the hotel can improve the privacy of the pool in the room. We have been staying for a day, and four or five staff members have suddenly broke in. They either fished the pool leaves or poured some powdery things into the pool and watched in the room. Suddenly someone was walking around by the swimming pool outside, it was really insecure!

The summer weekend is close to the full-room swimming pool and I don‚Äôt feel too crowded, and the experience is quite good.
But the slots are still those few. Although the service is enthusiastic but not familiar with the business, the front desk is not familiar with housekeeping and can't figure out the size of the baby cot. The restaurant‚Äôs service is a little messy and the training is insufficient. Everyone‚Äôs answers to questions are different.

Except for some small episodes during check-in, Liu Siqi at the front desk arranged check-in efficiency is too low and the attitude is very poor. The other staff are very nice. Especially to praise the security team, especially caring to customers, the security Xiaozhuang is very responsible, and will give care and greetings when going in and out.
The management of the housekeeping system also reflects the grade level of the hotel. The housekeeper Xiao Xie patiently explained the whole estate to us, which is very heartwarming.
Of course, what I like the most is the quick response of the front office manager Geng to the handling of the problem. He responded to many of my problems and gave her the lychees she picked.
I think that in addition to the hardware is a necessary feature of a star hotel, it is also that the training in all aspects of the software is in place. Especially the service and the speed of response make people feel like they are going home when they come to Congdu Manor, and customers can keep on flowing.
Overall it gives five points and will stay longer next time.

msg:Needless to say, the environment is indeed beautiful.
There is a problem:
1. The front desk is not professional. When we checked in, after we provided our ID cards, the front desk took the ID cards and checked the room and asked us to pay the check-in deposit. We thought the ID cards had been used up, so we kept them. After paying the deposit, he told us that we still needed our ID cards. Well, we had to find out our ID cards and give them to him. They provided the invoicing information when issuing the invoice but told me that it was OK without asking for my email address. Afterwards, they called my company to verify the information. I secretly went on a trip during the working day and the whole company knew about it. I was also drunk.
2. Because the room had a musty smell, I discussed with the front desk to add money to upgrade to a C-type room. The price difference between the two rooms on Ctrip was 300, so the hotel had to charge 400. Okay, I admit it. But the invoice for 400 has not been issued to me yet.
3. After all, it is the most expensive hot spring hotel in Conghua. I don‚Äôt know the brand of shampoo and shower gel. They are produced by a small factory in Shenzhen and have a very unpleasant smell. Fortunately, I brought a toiletry kit.
4. The Western restaurant is too small, and today is still a working day. When we left, there was already a long line of people waiting for a table at the door. Moreover, the breakfast is not rich, there are no meat dishes and there is no variety. It feels too far away from the big-name five-star hotels.
5. The sliding door on the balcony of the room is not equipped with a screen door. If the door is closed late at night, you will really not be able to sleep. There are many mosquitoes.
6. The carpet in the room has not been washed for a long time, and it has a strong smell.

I really don‚Äôt think this hotel is any good!
