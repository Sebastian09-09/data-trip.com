msg:We absolutely loved our relaxing stay at Seaview Resort. The staff all went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and convenient. We stayed in a pool spa villa room. An electric golf car could be summoned quickly to take us around the resort from our room. The room service food was delicious as was the Italian restaurant. 

Was such a treat to have pool access from our terrace. Then we could slowly swim around the canal area. Beautifully landscaped pool and surrounds. It also gave the feeling of privacy due to the layout of the rooms. Even though the hotel itself must have been very busy as it was golden week. The villas area has its own Waterscape cafe for breakfast and afternoon tea. Every pet of the resort was immaculately clean and staff were always somewhere nearby. 

Special mention must be made of English speaking staff member Ansen. He helped us with our more detailed questions, and gave us insight as to where to go for a nice walk in the gardens or to the beach. He made it seem like nothing was a problem for us during our stay. We truly appreciated his warm assistance. 

We would recommend this resort to anyone and only wish we could have stayed longer than 3 nights!

It's my 2nd time staying here, and the service was great with hassle free check in and out. The pools are clean, fresh towels everyday with a generous buffet. Dinner is an extra 150 RMB and the outdoor BBQ is a bit overpriced at 268 per person but has a  lovely ambience. The garden surrounding the villa is magnificent. I'll be back again oneday!

msg:It was raining on the May Day when we checked in, and the weather was very cold. We stayed in the garden poolside room, but unfortunately the temperature was relatively low for two days, so we didn't take the children swimming. As a result, the temperature was super good on the day after we changed hotels, haha, we just missed it. It must be great to take children swimming in summer! The poolside room in the main building we stayed in this time is actually better than the villa pool pool poolside room in Shuiyuan, but Shuiyuan is far from the main building, so we have to take an electric car, which is not so convenient. (Shuiyuan has its own breakfast restaurant).

The hotel's in-store tour needs to be booked in advance, which is to take a small train around the circle with explanations, which is very good! Recommended~

Plant Mobilization is to find plants and check in by yourself, and there will be small gifts. Children especially like it and can know many special plants~

There is a children's playground in the main building, and the Chinese restaurant set meal is good. The Western restaurant said that group coupons cannot be used on May Day, but it cost 700 yuan to order, which feels not worth it.

The lobby manager Xiao Ming really touched me. The service is serious and responsible. The handle of my room was broken, and he helped me repair it immediately, and the communication was smooth throughout the process.

The beach is very beautiful, and it is convenient to go there. It takes only five minutes to go through the underground passage. The Ring Road is very beautiful.

The hotel is not so easy to get a taxi in the peak season. There are many traffic jams here, so drivers don‚Äôt go there... There is no traffic jam near the hotel itself, but there is a lot of traffic jam in Zengcuoan and Tianquan Trail Square.

When there are many people in the hotel, you have to queue for breakfast~ 9 It‚Äôs very comfortable to go early. Overall, the rooms in the main building are a little old, but they are very comfortable to live in. It is also convenient to order takeout near Zengcuoan.

It feels a bit like an old hotel, but the parent-child facilities are very well done, whether it is the water park, the Little Dolphin Children's Park, or the small train, including the buffet breakfast and the children's dining area, they are very considerate and meticulous.

Hygiene: Very clean, very reassuring, the aunt cleaned very seriously

Service: The housekeeper intervened before check-in, everything was very comfortable

Thanks to the lobby manager Xiao Yu for his enthusiastic arrangement, which made me a little reluctant to leave

Environment: The high-rise building does have a good view
The restaurant and bar on the sixth floor for afternoon tea overlooks the sea
The hotel's outdoor swimming pool has a small door to go to the beach, and you need to go through an underground passage
But at least it is very close and this beach is less crowded! Clean

More than half an hour away from the airport
It's very fast to ride a bike to Zengcuo'an and it only takes 20 minutes to take a taxi to the city center
In general, it is very convenient

If it is normal, the price is still very beautiful. If I bring my children to Xiamen in the future, I will want to stay here again!

Someone recommended Seaview Resort Family Hotel when I read the travel guide. I booked a 4-day 3-night package on Ctrip with the intention of giving it a try. After a few days, it was proven that my choice was very wise. The hotel is in a good location. It takes 5 minutes to walk to the beach through the hotel shortcut, which meets the children's daily sand digging needs. The hotel has a good environment and service. It also offers travel photography. The photographer will teach you how to pose, and with the sea and beach, it feels like a blockbuster, not inferior to the level of professional organizations outside.

Five-star praise!

When checking in at the hotel, the service of the front desk lady was very nice. Unfortunately, there was no way to have two rooms next to each other, which was a pity for the elders!
The room was ok overall and very clean! Although it was a little old and a little damp, fortunately, the lobby manager Xiao Ming contacted me in advance so that I could communicate directly if I had any questions later. I told him on WeChat that the room was very damp and needed a dehumidifier, which was quickly arranged! There is nothing to say about the service, which makes people feel very comfortable!
I stayed for 4 nights. Chen Sijia and Yu Jie from the housekeeping depar**ent were very enthusiastic and cleaned very cleanly! When we needed it, they came to clean and replace the items we needed in time! Great!
This time I lived in the main building, and it was very convenient to go to outdoor and indoor swimming, children's playground, breakfast, dinner, afternoon tea, etc.! Especially to Huangcuo Beach, I personally think it is not far away! There were also super snails accompanying me along the way, and the children had a lot of fun watching it! I also want to thank Xiao Heimi and other staff in the group. If there are any questions, they will answer them in time, give directions, and help!
This trip, the accommodation, entertainment, food and drink are very satisfactory, the children are reluctant to leave, but there is a phenomenon that the older children in the children's park will bully the younger ones (my son was surrounded). I hope the staff of the children's park are not decorations! 
Next time I will stay at Haiyue Villa!

msg:For young babies, please choose Haiyue Villa without hesitation.

Let‚Äôs talk about the core advantages first: 1. Location: The core area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Ring Road on the island, it is convenient to go anywhere. Xiamen University, Botanical Garden, Zhongshan Road, and Science and Technology Museum are all within 20 minutes. The beach is directly connected to the hotel‚Äôs underground passage. This is the core competitiveness of Haiyue Villa. 2. Service: After booking, the room manager will add WeChat and provide almost 24-hour service to solve problems. Baby bed fences, toilets, and small footstools are all available and provided in a timely manner. If you need to solve any problem, someone will come to your door within three minutes. 3. The garden poolside room opens directly to the swimming pool recreation area, which is very convenient. If you live in the main building, the Little Dolphin Park, the small train, the restaurant, and the indoor and outdoor swimming pools are all within easy reach.

Disadvantages: The only thing that is lacking is that due to the age of the hotel, the lighting system and power sockets are indeed designed to be relatively small, but the overall hygiene is very clean, and no mold or discomfort due to the humid climate was found. The disadvantages do not cover the advantages.

Because of the one-stop baby walk, we refunded the homestays in other places and continued to stay. The reason for bringing a baby is comfort and peace of mind!

msg:The last two nights of this trip to Xiamen were reserved for Haiyue Resort. It is a parent-child hotel and did not disappoint us. The children love the small train, plant story, indoor children's playground and outdoor water park. It is a five-minute walk from Huangcuo Beach and provides sand digging tools, which is really great. During the stay, my brother suddenly had a fever and vomited all over the bed. After calling, someone came to change the bedding and brought white porridge to my sick brother. Ms. Huang Yueying from the housekeeping depar**ent was particularly warm and thoughtful, and the housekeeper Xiao Liao responded to our needs in a timely manner. I gave them a manual thumbs up! However, I still want to make some small suggestions. There is a strong musty smell in the room. I hope it can be improved next time. Everything else is very goodüëçüëçüëç

msg:After a 7-hour high-speed train ride, I arrived at the hotel at nearly 8 o'clock in the evening with a child and luggage. I hadn't had time for dinner yet. I just wanted to check in and lie down to rest. When checking in, the front desk said that children also need to scan their faces to verify their real names. Whose rule is this? She said that our hotel stipulates that all guests staying in the hotel need to scan their faces to verify their real names. Oh my God, I have traveled to many cities with my children in the past few years, and this is the first time I have encountered this. Based on the child's privacy, I refused to scan his face. A woman who looked like a manager came over and repeated the explanation that if the child did not have an ID card, he would need to go to the police station to get a certificate. I thought it was ridiculous and said directly that I would call 110. A 9-year-old child must scan his face to check in. The official explanation was given to me. After several phone calls, there was no definite answer. In the end, the child's name was registered and the ID number was not scanned before the room card was issued for check-in. It was so infuriating. I entered the room and wanted to boil water for tea to take a breath, but there was a hair in the cup. It was so disgusting! When I checked out on the last day, the service staff actually asked for a 5-star review. To be honest, if I really did a good job, I would give it, but after what happened on the first day, I think I will definitely give you a bad review. How can you have the nerve to ask for a good review if you can't even provide the most basic service?

msg:We were lucky to have a local friend recommend us to stay at Seaview Resort. The most important thing when traveling with children is that they have fun. The hotel's own children's playground made the children have fun and had a great time. The hotel's housekeeper, Xiao Zhang, also thoughtfully prepared the hotel's birthday cake üéÇ, which was a surprise. The two little birthday boys and girls happily spent a meaningful birthday in Xiamen. She also decorated the room carefully, which was warm and romantic. The hotel has lush plants, just like a botanical garden. The "Plants" activity is also very interesting. In the process of exploring the designated plants, we also learned knowledge. The concierge, Xiao Huang, also thoughtfully gave us two stationery sets. The most fortunate thing about this trip to Fujian is that we chose Seaview Resort Hotel. We will come again next time!

msg:I stayed at the Seaview Villa in Xiamen in 2018 and fell in love with it. This time I booked it a little later. The water garden is not cheap in the off-season, so I could only book the main building. The service is very good. The housekeeper contacted and added WeChat one day in advance. It was the lobby manager Xiao Yu. It was very convenient to find the housekeeper directly if needed. Parent-child friendly, you can borrow sand digging tools. There is a playground downstairs, which is very large and convenient for walking the baby. The hotel is very large and divided into three areas. The shuttle bus can also pick you up when you go out. The villa area is a large botanical garden. I feel that I don‚Äôt need to go to the Xiamen Botanical Garden to take pictures. The only thing is that the hotel opened earlier and is next to the sea. Now the fabric facilities are old. You can open the windows and have a balcony. It is better than the hotel experience in high-rise buildings that cannot open windows. It feels like a vacation. The beach opposite the hotel is not very good. It is different from what I remember. There are big stones and broken beer bottles.

msg:I rarely write reviews, but I must write about this one. The sanitary conditions are too poor. My whole family got infected with the virus when I stayed in this hotel.
The service of this hotel is indeed good, but this is the only bright spot. The waiters are very good, but the hardware is really bad.
The sofa is dirty and smelly, and the room is damp. If you can't keep the carpet clean, don't use carpets all over the house. Poor quality carpets with poor sanitary conditions will turn the whole hotel into a virus culture dish.
This hotel should have a lot of group buying activities. I didn't know before I booked it. I booked it temporarily so the price was not cheap. I thought I was staying in a normal five-star hotel, but!! After I checked in, I found that there were many group buying activities here. You can stay for two or three nights for more than a thousand yuan, so the whole hotel was full of sick children who couldn't reschedule because of group buying. Because many people bought at extremely low prices, there were a lot of people with extremely poor quality that you can't see in four-digit hotels. They spit everywhere, grab elevators, push children, grab coffee and food for breakfast... too many to mention. The experience was extremely bad. Those people who spit and make loud noises really opened my eyes. The hotel was so crowded that it was like a vegetable market.
We couldn't stand the coughing of children in the hotel. After checking out early, we got sick later. A vacation was ruined. This was a very bad experience. This hotel is only suitable for those who use group purchases and would rather let their children come with illness than waste hundreds of yuan a night's room fee, like to spit everywhere, glare at people, squeeze, and don't like cleanliness.

msg:The facilities are relatively old, I think they are very old, and there is no rope for hanging clothes in the bathroom, but the water supply is still good. We chose to live in the villa, which is a little far from the main building and needs to take a shuttle bus, which is not convenient. The environment in the villa is very good and quiet. The shuttle bus driver will introduce the plants and flowers in the hotel while driving. Basically, he will explain the plants every time he takes the bus, which is great! But it is really not very convenient. You need to take a bus to the main building for breakfast. Another point is that you need to walk a distance to the beach and cross the road. The road needs to go through an underground passage, and there are only stairs. The hotel service is still good, and it can be solved in the first time. The hotel may be the main parent-child hotel. There are really many children, and the lobby is noisy. The advantage of the villa is that you can go around and visit many plant areas inside, pretending to have been to the botanical garden. There is no need to queue up to check out. It rained before checking out, and the hotel also provided us with disposable raincoats and shoe covers, which was very heartwarming.

msg:Thanks to Ctrip for launching the Xiamen Haiyue Villa Hotel Garden Deluxe Poolside King Room pre-sale coupon package. Although this is a parent-child package, 2 adults and 2 children (under 1.2 meters) have many discounts on meals and entertainment. But for my wife and I to travel for leisure, the first feeling after checking in was that we made the right choice. Haiyue Villa is a large scenic spot with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1 million square meters, and as many as 20 different scenic spots have been named according to the sceneries. We are all elderly people in our 80s. Although we stayed for 4 nights and the hotel is equipped with a battery car that can be picked up and dropped off on demand, we still couldn't enjoy it. From the classic wooden stilt, you can overlook the Double Dragon Playing Pearl on Dadan Erdan Island, the Elder's Stone, and the bizarre Cactus Garden in the desert. In short, the greenery in Haiyue is worth lingering on. The key is that the villa is located on Haiyuntai on Huandao Road, which is the famous sea-viewing beach. This is a great environment. Talking about the micro-environment, although our house is not by the infinity pool, it is right by the children's pool. The guest room has a small courtyard on the ground floor balcony that leads directly to the poolside garden. Sometimes, it seems that we have traveled back to our childhood.
       The internal arrangement of the room is also very reasonable, and the washing area is also large. In addition to the shower, there is also a round bathtub next to the balcony, which young people can enjoy.
       When it comes to the hotel's service, it's impeccable. The staff are well trained. I remember when we first checked in, we arrived early and there were no rooms available. When we were dragging our luggage with nowhere to go, Huang Panpan (name on the badge) in the lobby took the initiative to greet us and asked her colleague Lu Hui to store our luggage. Use a battery car to get familiar with the environment of the villa. After coming back, he suggested that we take advantage of the good weather and go to the beach to take pictures. When we got the room card and checked in, Xiao Lu enthusiastically helped us carry our luggage. When he learned that the room was far away from the lobby, he went back to the front desk without bothering and changed the room number. In addition to cleaning, the housekeeping staff also placed peacocks or elephants folded in towels on the bed for the next two days, which reflected the villa's respect for the guests and expressed the staff's goodwill. We have breakfast and lunch at the villa every day. The meals are carefully arranged. The buffet lunch has a rich menu, allowing guests to taste the characteristics of Xiamen.
        It‚Äôs hard to describe all these experiences, but in short it was a satisfying and enjoyable travel experience.

When I took my children to the swimming pool, the most profound feeling was that the water quality was very good and very clean.

There is also a super large children's playground. It is best to bring non-slip socks. If you don‚Äôt have them, you can buy them in the hotel. The two children had a lot of fun. Su, the supervisor of the housekeeping depar**ent, saw that I had two babies and gave them small gifts. The babies even brought them when they were playing in the sand. We stayed for a total of four days. There was an auntie cleaning every day. Because we stayed for a long time, there was a comparison. The auntie on the second day cleaned very seriously and unexpectedly gave us fruits, which surprised us and made us feel warm. So I specially asked which auntie it was. I found out that it was cleaning auntie Yang Zhongmei. I would like to express my special thanks here. The duck down pillows in the hotel are also super comfortable and I slept very soundly. I plan to buy two and take them home. Overall, the recommendation index is full of stars!

Not only does it have a children's playground, a treasure hunt for plants, and a VR squirrel kingdom, but the battery car tour in the store is worth a ride, and you can visit the garden comfortably.
The children all love the train, and the surprise is that they also provide sand digging tools for the children, which is so considerate! The beach is also very close to the hotel, just across the road from the hotel.

The outdoor swimming pool is not open in April. Imagine the scene when it opens in May, it must be a scene of children laughing.

In addition, Haiyue's restaurant is worth a visit. The Chinese restaurant is amazing, and the breakfast buffet is also good!
One of the two best bowls of shacha noodles I have eaten in Xiamen is produced by the Mediterranean Western Restaurant. It has a rich taste and sufficient ingredients, and the ingredients are used very well!

Xiao Liao in the lobby answers all questions, is enthusiastic and efficient. After leaving the hotel, I found that I forgot my glasses in the room. I contacted Xiao Liao on WeChat, and he quickly found and found a way to return them to me. He is trustworthy.

msg:Many people think that Xiamen Haiyue Villa is a family hotel near the sea. Indeed, this state hotel seems to have always been very different. It has been the number one family hotel in Xiamen for many years. However, family-friendly is not all of Haiyue Villa. Just as the hotel part is only It occupies a very small piece of the million-square-meter land of Haiyue Villa. Don't forget that the name of the hotel is "Mountain Villa", and I think the villa part of the Villa is the real essence of the hotel.
.
It occupies most of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel and even includes a small mountain. The wooden plank road for climbing is nearly one kilometer long. It has carefully cultivated as many as 400 kinds of rare plants and more than 20,000 trees. If you come here for a walk, you will be amazed even by the trees. Even the Xiamen Botanical Garden, which is famous on the Internet, feels boring. More importantly, compared with the bustling people and noisy children in the main building, it is so quiet that it can be reserved. I didn‚Äôt see any other residents during the two days of shopping. It‚Äôs really It feels so holiday-like and perfect for couples.
.
Dignified and heavy villas are scattered among the green gardens. Each villa has its own swimming pool and public area. The density of guest rooms is very low. Take the Orchid Garden where I stayed this time, there are less than 10 guest rooms. It looks like a private room, but it is equipped with a tea room, chess and card room, conference room, audio-visual room, banquet hall, etc. It has the feeling of a private house. This is the real trea**ent of a state guest, right?
.
I stayed in Room 2228 this time. It is located on the 2nd floor of Lanyuan. It is also the only suite. It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 100 square meters. It has a square shape. The double doors at the end of the corridor are very stylish. There is a side cabinet at the entrance to put things casually. I like it. The design is followed by the corridor leading to the living room, the guest bathroom on the left, the main bathroom, the bedroom and the cloakroom on the right.
.
The living room is very spacious, with a large pot of green plants, and abundant welcome fruits have been placed. Although there is no capsule coffee machine or tea bag Lipton, the small refrigerator has 8 bottles of soft drinks and potato chips for free every day, plus 6 bottles of Wuyi Mountain Spring. worry.
.
The bedroom is more European-style than the living room. The bedside stool is very beautiful. The bedding can be said to be top-notch comfortable, silky and skin-friendly. The large sofa by the window feels very comfortable when lying on it.
.
The master bathroom has a single basin, the same Australian app from Autograph for spares, and the Kohler bathtub with a headrest is very comfortable and can lie flat for deep soaking. It is a pity that the toilet does not have a smart toilet, but it is equipped with a mobile phone shelf.
.
The villa was the first to open in 2007, but this suite is well maintained and feels much newer than the suite in the main building. The decoration is classic and will not be outdated. Except for the lack of centralized lighting control, it is so comfortable to live in that I feel reluctant to leave.

Walking slowly around the island, the spring breeze blows ten miles away, and the waves caress the golden sand. The clouds stop and wait for the moon, the egret rises from the lonely island, and the sky and sea gradually turn red. The fishing boat sings at night, it must be from a Shanghai-style family. The oyster cake is slightly burnt, the rock tea soup is ringing, and the water is flowing.
Among the thousands of rocks and pines, visitors can find flowers from the Five Continents. Follow the Yunlin plank road, step on the mountains and the sea, and you will feel the tranquility. At the foot of Wanyue Slope, electronic music blared softly, and "Forgetting Love in the End of the World" came. When I woke up from the wide couch in the villa, I heard the chirping of birds.

The room was fully equipped and the MINI bar had welcome fruits in place. The aunt who cleaned every day would not only clean the room but also give it to me. We added fruit snacks and drinking water and couldn't finish it. This time we arranged a courtyard to make tea. It was very pleasant. Because there were green plants and people passing by, it was completely quiet and safe. I could calm down, drink tea and look around. The little squirrels gnawed the bark on the tree. On the last day, we stored our luggage and went to the Executive Tianyue Pavilion on the 6th floor to see the sea and drink afternoon tea. The holiday ended successfully. Thank you very much for your arrangement and making me feel at home.
   Following the manager's travel guide, we toured the private garden in depth. There are also single-family villas nearby to meet different needs. I will come again if I have the opportunity.

The garden is also quite impressive, the children's playground is more colorful and the people there are much younger.

On the way, the taxi driver said that this was the place where Guo Jia was used to entertain Guo Jia's leaders.
At the time of the consequences, the hotel is great. The hotel is huge. It is said that there is 1 million square meters, which is a large botanical garden itself. Go to the front desk to get a map to get gifts for the botanical garden.
There are indoor heating pools in the outdoor swimming pool. There are water parks. There are indoor children's parks with parent -child classrooms, star cinema, and small train. Parent -child activities are really rich in setting.
And also given garden travel, shooting in the hotel is very good!
The small door of the garden pool on the first floor of the hotel went out to the seaside around the island road through a underground passage.
This time the front desk has been upgraded to the room type. The room balcony is connected to the pool. The scenery is beautiful. I dare not think that it will be cool to push the door in summer.
The whole family is super satisfied, especially children, it ‚Äôs right!

There is also an indoor swimming pool with a water temperature of around 27 or 8 degrees. There are also some other parent-child activities.

msg:The hotel's cleanliness is given 1 star because there is no 0 star to give.
Let‚Äôs talk about room hygiene first, staying for two nights in a row. After staying the first night, I came back from playing on the second day and wanted to drink water. I took out the cup and saw the cup that had been "cleaned" upside down. Looking at the tea stains around it, I knew it was just rinsed with water, dried and put back in place. I washed it again myself without taking any pictures at the time. Later, I took out my son's cup and poured him water. I looked at the bottom of the cup and saw that the honey stains left over from drinking water the night before were still there. This time I took a photo. When I went to bed at night and took off my pillow, I saw that the piece of paper the child had torn the day before was still underneath. Everything seems to be cleaned on the surface, but in fact it creates a very perfunctory feeling of cleaning, and nothing is cleaned.

Let‚Äôs talk about the restaurant. On the first day I went to have breakfast, I took a coffee cup to receive the coffee. The coffee cup was turned upside down and had a chip and coffee stains on it. Later, another customer also reported this situation, and the waiter said that the customer might have put it back after drinking. of. The child was holding a glass to catch the juice, and I was baking toast next to him. I heard the child say that the glass was leaking, and I was thinking about why it was leaking. When I saw it, my mother was shocked! ! A glass was rotten in a V-shape from the rim to the bottom. It was not just a small piece, but the rotten area accounted for a quarter of the entire cup. I was shocked and angry. Fortunately, the child didn't slip into my hands or mouth. I told the waiter, and the waiter said that another customer might have broken it and put it back. He quickly took it away. At breakfast the next day, a waiter asked me what I thought of the restaurant. I told the truth and a girl came over and gave me cookies and small toys to apologize.

As for service, this is the worst service star hotel I have ever stayed in during my trip to Xiamen. When checking in, the front desk did not take the initiative to tell where breakfast was. The child needed a bath bag to take a bath at night. After calling for an hour, no one brought it, and called a second time to ask for it; for breakfast on the first day, it was probably We were so busy that there were no tableware on the table, so we went to get it ourselves; except for the little girl who helped carry the gifts to the room on the first day and talked to you with a smile, I have never seen anyone take the initiative to say hello or communicate with a smile. , all with cold faces, and I even complained, "The so-called post-00s generation who are rectifying their workplaces probably all gathered in this hotel."

I was upgraded to a suite, which I originally thought was a good thing, but it turned out that the smell in the room was probably caused by the lack of ventilation for a long time.

There are also breakfast varieties, can't you look at your colleagues more? Look at Hiltons, Howard Johnsons, and Hiltons with lower prices than yours, as well as Hiltons in the same price range, and see what kind of breakfast they have? In such a big restaurant, apart from seating, what are the options for eating? For out-of-town tourists, they are not used to eating sand tea noodles and seafood-flavored noodle paste. There are too few types of cold dishes, hot dishes and pastries. It takes a long time to go back and forth to choose, but there is nothing to choose from.

One thing that is worthy of praise is that there are enough bottled water, and there are six bottles in the room.

Ctrip is also making false propaganda. It is said that booking together is more expensive than booking individually. The comparison made by Ctrip is that if you book together, you can enjoy riding a small train and playing in a children's playground. Later I learned that all guests staying here can enjoy these.

One thing to say, as a resort hotel, the environment is impeccable. It should be better in summer. Lots of outdoor swimming pools. The garden is filled with lush green plants, which makes you feel relaxed and happy.

The advantage is that the water is clean, beautiful and clear. The front desk and doormen need more training, or the hotel signs should be written more clearly and the names should be unified.

msg:My child is young and I chose the child-friendly family hotel Haiyue. It was my first time staying in a hotel and I was a lot worried. Later, we upgraded to a room on the first floor with a garden. The children especially liked it. There is a water park right outside the garden. Although it was too cold to play, the children were very happy. It is also very convenient to go to the beach opposite.
A bed rail is provided so you don't have to worry about falling off the bed. There is a large bathtub where the children can take a bath and play in the water every day.
It is also relatively quiet at night and does not affect sleep.
Very satisfied with the overall service.
The waiter, Sister Yu, cleans in a timely manner, folds elephants and geese with towels, and gives lollipops to the children.

The swimming pool is very clean and beautiful. The water temperature reaches 29 degrees. It is as warm as spring and is suitable for winter swimming. There are enough towels and other supplies, which is satisfactory.
It is worthy of praise that Xiao Wu from the concierge depar**ent used a shuttle bus to take us on a tour of the hotel, introducing the history and construction scale of the hotel in detail, which opened our eyes to the guests. Although they were just looking around, they also appreciated the noble temperament of the state guesthouse. ha.

There are also regrets:
I originally came here for the beautiful garden scenery of the hotel, but half of it was not open to the public, which was quite disappointing;
Sending fruits to guests during their nap time interferes with their rest and is inappropriate;
The bathrobe in the room was not replenished after it was taken away. I was really worried about being misunderstood. I only replenished it after phone inquiries.

As a result, the lobby manager Xiao Ming and Xiao Li found out about our anniversary and gave me a large bouquet of flowers. It feels like there can be 50 flowers.

It is well maintained, and the biggest advantage is that it is very close to the seaside, which is very suitable for bringing children.
The only drawback is that the decoration of the hotel is slightly outdated. Although the suite is large, it only has one bathroom. The double bed is too small and not enough for a family of three to sleep on.

I saw a different Haiyue Villa Hotel. The hotel is very large, equivalent to a tourist attraction, and the scenery inside is very good. Elegant

Service: I feel that the service of a big hotel is polite from top to bottom. The experience is very good. Xiao Ming, the lobby manager, responds very quickly to WeChat and has troubled him a lot.
Facilities: Because the hotel has been built for a long time, some of the facilities in the room are still relatively old, but the overall maintenance is relatively good. The hotel has been painting the exterior walls in the past two days, but the indoor and outdoor swimming pools are still very tall.
Hygiene: OK, average
Overall it's pretty good. It's close to Huandao Road and the beach is right at the back door.

    The hotel has arranged a dedicated butler. I would like to mention in particular that my butler, Manager Xiao Ming, is very nice, gentle and patient. He helps us solve all our needs. Thumbs up.
    I would also like to focus on the hotel‚Äôs catering, which covers both north and south, as well as Chinese and Western cuisine (see the picture, I took more than a dozen photos to get a rough idea). Due to our schedule, we only had breakfast at the hotel, but even so, my parents were full of praise.

msg:I declare this to be my favorite hotel in the country, bar none.
Originally I only planned to stay in Xiamen for two days, but stayed in this hotel for a week. I originally thought that she ranked Moganshan Naked Castle tied for first place in my mind, but on the third day of my stay, she decisively surpassed Moganshan Naked Castle and became the well-deserved number one in my mind. This low-rise villa-style hotel with a mountain and sea and a large garden is really great.
Xiamen's Yuehai Villa did not disappoint. The hotel has upgraded to an executive sea-view double room. The layout of the room is different from that of ordinary five-star hotels. The entrance is through a narrow corridor and the privacy is very good. Even if the door is open, you can't see anything. Inside, the bathtub is connected to the window, giving you a beautiful view. The height of the 5th floor of the main building is just right for overlooking Kinmen Island. It can also be regarded as a unique sea view room.
	
Another advantage of this kind of hotel is that it is very quiet. Like a high-floor five-star hotel, there are many people coming and going, which makes it very noisy. A hotel like this is particularly quiet because it is relatively far away from the city, making it especially suitable for a comfortable vacation and recuperation.

The scenery of the hotel is particularly beautiful. There is a small train that goes around the hotel in a small circle for one hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon. There is also Yuegui Garden, which is not open to the public. It has a large garden where exotic flowers and plants are blooming. It is so well maintained that there is not a single **** in it.
	
There are 18 large and small swimming pools in Haiyue Villa. I think they are well maintained. It is impossible to change the water in the swimming pool once a week. At least there are no impurities, it is very blue and has no odor. Lifeguards are always watching over it. There are three lifeguards walking around the children's swimming pool all the time. How is it possible that there are not a few fallen leaves in the outdoor swimming pool? Many negative reviews online are really nitpicking. I tried several swimming pools, all with constant temperature, and the water quality was very good and clean.
	
The service is also great, especially the cleaning lady, who is very kind and friendly. The ladies at the front desk are also very nice, especially Xiao Ming, the lobby manager, who is responsive to all requests. WX is always online and can solve various problems in seconds.
Overall, there is nothing wrong with staying at Haiyue Villa in Xiamen.
No matter in terms of service and environment, I don‚Äôt know how many streets it has surpassed those high-rise five-star Internet celebrity hotels.
Very suitable for leisure vacation travel.

It is indeed very rich. The small train in the park is said to be an amusement park, so it is better to go around by yourself. It is just for children to play. If you don't bring children, you don't need to experience it.

The day before check-in, the lobby managers Xiao Peng and Xiao Ming added WeChat to inquire about the needs in advance. When they learned about the child's birthday, they specially decorated the room and prepared a birthday cake (the birthday cake was not ambiguous at all, it was very delicious!!) The hotel also has a small train and an ocean ball park, which are the favorites of children. It was very comfortable to stay for two days. I went to dig sand at Huangcuo Beach opposite every day (the hotel is particularly convenient for going to the beach). It was very relaxing and I also got 5 free tickets. For travel photography, all the service staff in the hotel are very friendly, responsive and efficient. Not only was the room upgraded for free, but check-out on the same day was also extended. Before I checked in, I was still wondering whether the hotel that was renovated a few years ago would be new enough. But after I checked in, all my worries were gone. The hotel is very clean and the decoration is not outdated at all. In short, it is a great family hotel. If I come back in the future, Xiamen, the first choice is Haiyue Villa (this evaluation is completely from the heart, Luo Liba has been typing a lot)

2. The hotel feels like you need to spend money everywhere. Breakfast at 168 is really too expensive, even more expensive than many hotels. It‚Äôs really not that delicious.
3. It is difficult to distinguish between charged things and free things in the hotel. For example, the drinks in the refrigerator are free on the first day, but refills on the second day are charged, but the room does not make it clear. And that tea, my mother took away the 38 yuan without noticing. No wonder a deposit is required. Many hotels no longer require a deposit. It should be because there are too many consumption items, so the deposit is convenient later. Deduct money
4. Let me remind those coming later that if children want to play in the playground, they need to bring anti-slip socks in advance. A pair is 10 yuan on site.
5. I can understand why hotels don‚Äôt allow takeaways to be delivered by takeaways, but many hotels now have food delivery robots. Can‚Äôt your hotel improve its service? Because sometimes when I stay in a hotel, I really want to have a good rest and don‚Äôt want to move around. Moreover, this hotel is very big, so it‚Äôs really troublesome to walk several times a day.
6. The hotel is older and larger. The air is really bad. There is a very unpleasant smell as soon as you enter the room.

The park is very large, and the concierge's shuttle bus and sightseeing car are very convenient. Convenient, attitude and service are good.

Facilities: It is recommended to upgrade the indoor swimming pool locker room cabinets. When there were few swimmers (less than 5 people), the front desk informed me that there were no bracelets, and even slippers in the locker room were gone. After the feedback, the lady on duty found a solution in time. She still hopes to improve and maintain the ceiling height of the Xiamen Family Hotel.

Considering that he was bringing two children, he upgraded to the quiet Water Garden Villa room type for free. It's really great, the hotel has good reviews!
It happened to be the hotel's birthday and there was a cake, which was really thoughtful.

msg:I stayed in the main building of Haiyue Villa. The hotel service was very good. The front desk, lobby, floor, restaurant, telephone customer service...the service staff I encountered were all trying their best to provide satisfactory services. It's a pity that only Xiao Ming and Peng Xiong are remembered and praised by name.
The house price went up a lot during the holidays. To my surprise, I was upgraded to an executive sea view room. The sea view from the 5th floor was amazing. There is an oversized bathtub next to the window, and my child will miss taking a bath every day.
There are many swimming pools downstairs and very close to the beach. There are two hours of small trains every day, and you can ride in a circular queue for free.
The rooms are almost full during the holidays, so breakfast is inevitably crowded. There is no need to queue before 8:30, there are many categories, and overall it is okay. The view is nice while sitting by the pool.
The children's playground is very new and clean, and children must wear non-slip socks. There are staff cleaning and reminding children to pay attention to safety.
The only drawback is that the travel photos the hotel cooperates with are not very good. It's not as good as taking pictures with my own camera. It is rare to select 5 pieces for free.

msg:The equipment in the room is relatively old, the equipment is old, there is dirt on the toilet seat, and the service attitude is not very good. It is not worthy of the price. I met two cleaning ladies. During the day, the young one asked her to change the bedding. I agreed, turned around and walked towards the sanitation truck and muttered "It's really troublesome". She thought I didn't hear her, so I said "It's troublesome" to my smiling face and asked my aunt to take out the garbage in the evening. She I was asked to put it on the balcony, but I later threw it into the trash can outside without changing the trash bag. I took my children back to the hotel from the city in the evening and wanted to play on the water slide. To be honest, I booked this hotel because I wanted to play on the parent-child water slide. I played on the slide several times and was told to stop by multiple staff members. Adults can't play on the slide. I'm very disappointed. We rushed back from the city to play on the water slide without damaging it. I weigh 100 pounds. Six of their staff were watching on the shore, like prisoners. Later, our family returned The room was full of disappoin**ent, so disappointing. It's very sunny during the day, and there are tables and chairs on the shore with no shade or parasols. Children who are afraid of the sun should choose carefully. For older children, middle-aged children and their families, you can only watch and play while you bask in the water. Parents whose children dare not play independently should be careful. They do not allow adults to play with them, so consider carefully. . The hotel breakfast costs 168 per person. The breakfast seems to have many types, tastes average, and lacks local characteristics. It's a little pricey, but I saw a lot of people ordering takeout for breakfast. The hotel is located in Siming District, more than 10 kilometers to the Botanical Garden, more than 7 kilometers to Xiamen University, and more than 10 kilometers to the pier. There are serious traffic jams on the road. You need to take a taxi to go to scenic spots. The hotel is also far from places to eat, so you need to take a taxi, and there are few choices, which is inconvenient. In short, the hotel service is poor, the equipment is old, the check-in experience is very uncomfortable, travel is inconvenient, and it is far from the scenic spot. It is not worth the price and I am disappointed. This trip was originally a happy thing, because the hotel swimming pool staff's fierce way of handling the problem caused a bad feeling. The key is that I didn't do anything, just played on their slide. If they had handled it gently, this wouldn't have happened, or if the hotel's promotion didn't favor parents and children, they would have been so disappointed!

It‚Äôs really comfortable to live in Haiyue. The scenery outside the window is beautiful, like an oil painting. You can sit on the balcony to enjoy the breeze and look at the sea view. It‚Äôs so beautiful!
The greenery is very good, and the sun is not very hot all the way to the beach. There is a small pavilion on the beach directly opposite the hotel, which happens to have a large green area. This place is really suitable for digging sand. Adults can sit on the steps and play with their mobile phones. This location Really awesome, no need to tan haha. There were small shells after the beach receded, and I saw people catching small crabs on the rocks next to it. I also found a hermit crab~
When it comes to eating, we sometimes go out to eat and sometimes order takeout. It‚Äôs very convenient to take a taxi directly to the lobby. We also played with the small train in the children's playground, and the baby was very happy.

Service: Thanks to the lobby manager Xiao Ming! Before arriving in Xiamen, I called the place to confirm and asked what I needed. We also added WeChat for easy contact. It is very convenient to call the service in the room, and it is also very convenient to send WeChat. There is welcome fruit on the first day.
During the stay, I encountered the typhoon "Du Su Rui". Although I couldn't go out to play, but stayed in the hotel, the children didn't stop at all. There is a game pool outside, and a children's playground and swimming pool indoors. In short very satisfied!
Also booked a hotel tour. The shooting of the two young ladies is still very careful. The weather is hot, and I am working hard to pursue perfection. In addition to the 5 free gifts, I paid for 5 more. The main reason is that the photographer and the assistant sister have worked hard~ Let's see for yourself if you need it~

In addition, I am very grateful to the manager MM who is responsible for customer service on the fifth floor of the hotel.

When we went to the beach, she proactively asked if we wanted beach tools. It makes people feel warm. I like the dishes in the Chinese restaurant in the hotel. I ordered a table. There is no minefield. Everyone is delicious, especially the pancake stuffed with meat floss. I highly recommend the longevity noodles that are given away. Everyone is rushing to eat them.

msg:I have been longing to come and go to Haiyue, and finally made the trip this summer. Arranged a 360-degree sea view room in the middle of the main building, which is great. Executive sea view rooms can also enjoy afternoon tea every day, with a panoramic view of delicious food and beautiful scenery. The children had a great time playing in the garden swimming pool + Little Dolphin Paradise, and they didn‚Äôt even want to go out for a stroll. It‚Äôs enough to play in the hotel. The noodles for breakfast are delicious, and there is a location near the infinity pool if you go early. The lobby manager, Xiao Ming, came one day in advance to take the initiative to contact and provide nice service. Next time I come to Xiamen, I will still choose Haiyue, it is worth having! The suggestion is that there are few electrical outlets in the room and there is no USB interface. Nowadays, many electronic devices need to be charged when going out.

Walk through the garden pool and you will arrive at Huangcuo Beach, three minutes away. There is also a children's playground. I have been recommending this hotel to others since my return.

msg:ÔøºI chose this resort hotel on purpose. I heard that it is still a state guesthouse, so I am looking forward to it. After the reservation was made, the manager of the hotel, Xiao Wang and Xiao Ming, took the initiative to contact us and asked if we had any needs. I heard that the child had a birthday these few days, and took the initiative to add WeChat. Not only did the room be decorated in advance, but also I sent a big birthday cake, which tasted pretty good.
It must be said that this hotel feels really clean. Before booking, considering that there are many swimming pools and a lot of greenery, I was worried about mosquitoes, but these worries were completely unnecessary. When I woke up early in the morning, I saw that there were staff cleaning the swimming pool. The water quality was really, really clean. After staying for two nights, there were no mosquitos. One can imagine how clean the hotel is.
In addition, I must praise the shower head in the shower room. The water flow is really strong and very comfortable. This is really important for people staying in hotels. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel's pillows are too soft, soft and inelastic. After two nights of sleep, I am a little tired and my neck is sore.
The hotel really focuses on children's holidays. Many details are very thoughtful. There are many children's facilities. Even the restaurant has a special children's dining area. There are many large meeting rooms on the first floor, which can be said to be a one-stop place for vacation, business and leisure.
It's also very convenient to go out, and it's not too far from Ôøºattractions. ÔøºIn short, it was a very satisfying stay experience. Ôøº

Thank you to Chen Liyang from the concierge depar**ent for your patience in helping me book the Gulangyu ferry ticket; thank you to the manager of Shuiyuan Cafe, even though I just stopped by to buy two ice creams, he still cared about my stay experience; thank you to the restaurant manager Yu for his warm and thoughtful service.
It is a very wise choice if you bring your children to live here, it is not too convenient to be separated from the beach üèñ all the way. Children generally don't like to visit tourist attractions, they only care about whether it's fun or not. There are 18 outdoor swimming pools here, and there are small slides in the swimming pools. Kangle has a small indoor naughty castle, and you can watch movies at nightüé¨. The hotel itself is located in the botanical gardens, and the hotel's small train parade and story of plants encourage guests to discover the beauty of the hotel. We only visited the hotel on the last day. In fact, when it is too hot or rainy to go out with the children, just playing in the hotel is enough~
Finally, I have a little suggestion. Breakfast is too monotonous. Maybe I am a northerner and I am not used to it. My daughter eats bread and intestines every day, and I eat waffles and bacon every day. Of course, there is no product that can satisfy everyone, and the flaws are not concealed. Next time I come to Xiamen, I will still choose to live in Haiyue!

In particular, let‚Äôs talk about the Little Dolphin Children‚Äôs Paradise, which is also great! Few parent-child hotels have such a large-scale amu*****t park, which is clean and complete.

The Chinese restaurant tastes good and is also the best place for service in the whole hotel.
It relies on the environment and location to win. The public beach is a tunnel outside the back door, but it is a bit troublesome to get in and out. The back door is not open until 6:30 in the morning. I got up at 5 o'clock to watch the sunrise. When I arrived, I found that the door was closed. I called the transfer according to the sign, and the front desk said that it could not be transferred... Is the number transferred by the sign a scam? Finally, I had no choice but to go out from the main door and walk to the beach.
The room ordering can't be connected, and the call has not been returned. I can only call ** when I am hungry.
From breakfast to coffee shop consumption, the waiters in the hotel are very well-trained to chase the guests to sign two names and leave their phone numbers and room numbers first. It feels like they are worried that the guests will not admit it.
The customer service is very active. I added WeChat one day in advance. I asked about the room type but couldn't explain it clearly. I didn't show up during the two-day stay. After leaving Xiamen, I asked how my stay was.
The check-in experience during the May Day holiday was very average. The hotel staff seemed to be temporarily pulled over to work, and the cost performance was really low

The room was small in size but clean and tidy and the bathtub with a view was nice.
The attitude of the service staff is very good. The lobby managers Xiaoming and Xiaoye provide good service. They called one day in advance to confirm the room type requirements, and added WeChat to facilitate communication.
Welcome fruit and Su Xiaotang were presented.
During the peak period of May Day, there is no need to wait for breakfast, which is very good.
From the side entrance of the hotel tennis court, you can go directly to the Tatou area. There are many seafood shops and specialty snack bars, which is very convenient.

During the May Day period, there are huge crowds of people everywhere. The swimming pool, beach, and playground here have normal flow of people. You can also explore and find plants.

Usually the price is still within the budget, and the May Day price is really a bit distressed.
But the overall experience is very good.
The service is always online.

The water court room is still full of new ones.

[You can swim in the poolside room by pushing the door, full of vacation feeling]
There is a children's paddling pool in the water garden, with slides, and toys such as water guns can be borrowed.
But if you wear a swimsuit and don't bring your mobile phone, you can't borrow it.
On the first day of May Day, the temperature was 29, and the water was still a bit cold.

„ÄêClose to the beach, less people on Moon Slope Holiday„Äë
There are a lot of people during the May Day holiday in Xiamen, there are traffic jams everywhere, and the scenic spots are also crowded.
Near the hotel is Wanyuepo, there are basically no people, and there are internet celebrity coffee shops
The beach is clean and the sea is blue

„ÄêComplete parent-child supporting facilities„Äë
pool beach
Small train
indoor amu*****t park
Intimate afternoon tea
very suitable for baby
When the guest room staff delivered the welcome fruit, they saw a child and gave them an anti-mosquito wristband
There are activities arranged every day, we experienced rabbits and dinosaur digging

„ÄêSuperior location„Äë
Backed by mountains and facing the sea, few people are quiet
Take a 20-minute taxi ride from Xiamen Station, and there will be no traffic jams in the tunnel during May Day
It's not far to take a taxi to attractions like Shapowei Bashi
Looking at the plan, there will be Line 3 in the future, and it should be more convenient to travel after opening

If you come to Xiamen again, you will choose this hotel

msg:Although I didn't expect much when I booked the hotel (Dad liked it). But with a unique preference for the State Guest House and the parent-child hotel advertised by bringing a baby, I locked in this hotel more than a month before May Day. It turned out that my father's vision was quite poisonous. If someone asked me if it was worth it, I would strongly recommend this hotel.
Hardware and environment: As a state guesthouse, the hardware is old without exception, but this does not spoil its sense of experience. On the contrary, the services of the state guesthouse are all yyds, and the maintenance of environmental sanitation is also very good. I noticed that the hotel had been renovated before I booked the hotel, so when I checked in, I found it was not as old as some guests commented, and, most importantly: clean! As an extremely clean freak, I am actually willing to take a bath here (require the waiter to disinfect on-site, and provide a bath bag for free), it is all suggested by the waiter, and I am very happy. It is also very clean for women and girls to take off their shoes and walk around in the room, very satisfied!
Service: It can be said to be super five-star! The attitude of the waiters is gentle and gentle, with quality and a sense of boundaries, which made me feel the warmth of home while experiencing the VIP service, reflecting the details everywhere, making me feel extremely comfortable. Our whole family feels that the service here is better than Xihai!
Food: When May Day comes here, the biggest worry is that people follow the crowd! But the hotel does not have this feeling, everything is in order, the Chinese restaurant has an elegant and clean environment, you don‚Äôt need to worry about bringing your baby, there are baby tableware, and the dishes are first-class, the key is that it is not expensive! Great value for money! I think, next time I come to Xiamen, I will choose this hotel again!
The point you want to make complaints about is that it may be far-fetched to advertise a parent-child hotel. After all, there are not many programs specially prepared for children. Some of the special programs prepared are only for ten families. The sincerity is not enough. After all, parents and children who come to stay There should be a large number of traveling families. In addition, the garden area is actually not large, and the small train experience takes seven or eight minutes to circle around. However, it should be good to go in summer. The outdoor swimming pool is very clean and I really want to jump in it, but the weather is still a bit cold. The outdoor water park should be quite fun. The road opposite the hotel is the beach, so it is very convenient to go to the beach.

As soon as I entered, I was amazed by the greenery of the hotel. Check-in went smoothly. During the holidays, we even upgraded the room type. The room has a swimming pool. Really Surprise, catching up with the child's birthday, the hotel lobby manager contacted us before check-in, decorated the room for the child and sent a cake. It was a surprise. Special thanks to the manager Xiaoming Ricardo! !

msg:This trip to Xiamen brought children who haven't gone out for a long time, so I specially booked this hotel with a high parent-child rating. The hotel gate is quite far from the lobby, and the road is green, so the environment is nothing to say. The room is also furnished in a fairytale style. The small tent is loved by the beasts. Half of the balcony is divided into a bathtub, and the other half can sit and bask in the sun. It is super comfortable. Below is a huge circular swimming pool, which will definitely be super lively in summer. The breakfast in the hotel is very rich, combining Chinese and Western food, there is everything you want to eat, and the noodle stalls can be refined down to what kind of noodles to choose and what ingredients to put, which is very considerate. The children's playground downstairs in the lobby has a huge area, and the staff are also very enthusiastic and will interact with the children, but it may be a bit smelly after it has just been renovated. The hotel staff I met during my two-day stay were very friendly, and they would take the initiative to say hello to the guests. The front desk was also responsive, and taught us how to book a taxi when we first arrived in Xiamen. When we encountered problems during check-out, Xiao Zhou at the front desk also wholeheartedly helped the customers For the sake of thinking, we actively solved the problem. It is worthy of a five-star hotel with first-class service. Except that it is inconvenient to eat outside the hotel (there are no shops around, but it is very convenient to order takeaway), these two days have been a perfect experience.

There are multiple swimming pools inside, as well as a small train for children's playgrounds, which can be experienced for free after check-in. When traveling with a baby, the most important thing is to be able to handle all the food, drink and fun in the hotel!
Personally, I think the hotel is very friendly to parents and children. We stayed in a twin room with garden view. Because I wanted to play more, I booked an extra night, a total of three nights. The hotel manager communicated with me about my check-in needs in advance before I came. I also upgraded the room for me. When I leave the room, there is a small yard directly leading to the swimming pool (it will definitely be more fun when the outdoor swimming pool is only open in May). I also had the cheek to ask the manager for an afternoon tea with a sea view, but the manager readily agreed! Opposite the hotel is the beach, you need to go through the small door of the hotel, go through the underground passage, and you can get there in about 6 or 7 minutes. You can rent sand dredging tools in the hotel lobby when you check in (this is so thoughtful, you don‚Äôt need to bring it yourself). There is a specific time for the small train every day, and the whole journey is only 10 minutes. Little Dolphin Paradise also has fixed activities every day.
Online car-hailing and taxiüöï can drive directly to the hotel lobby. About 30 minutes to the city. Finally, special thanks to Xiao Peng and Xiao Ming, the lobby managers of the hotel, who have been patiently communicating and introducing carefully. The efficiency is super high. Like itüëç

Room:
The room was upgraded to an executive sea view room. You can see the sea on the fifth floor, but it is not the closest to the sea, so the scenery is not as expected. A friend booked a garden waterside room. When you go out, you are in the garden, and next to it is the pool. Because the outer pool is not open yet, you can only look at it, but it happens to be hot, so children can step on the water a little.

breakfast:
There are not many varieties, but there are many dishes and noodles, which are not bad

Serve:
Arrive at the hotel by taxi, the welcome service at the door is not bad, very proactive.
There are times in the morning and afternoon where you can take the small train. The train is quite new and has sound effects. When I heard the baby asking about the sound, I played it again for him.
Overall, everything is good, but the waiting time for the room is a bit long. I went to check in at noon and said it was being cleaned. It was good around 1:30, and it was completely fine until 2:30. , If we say early that the room cannot be released, we will not wait and arrange to go to other places.

The location of the hotel is very good, not far from the scenic spots, and not in the busy city with many cars and people! Eating, shopping, and takeaway are extremely convenient!

The hotel occupies a large area. It can be said that it is a large botanical garden attraction. On the day we left, we visited the hotel as part of the itinerary throughout the morning, and participated in the hotel's parent-child activities to find plants. In the end, the children were very satisfied. With her little gift, she got to know plants again.
The hotel is very quiet, and the bed is very comfortable. I am woken up by the birds outside every day, and I can see the landscape swimming pool downstairs when I open the window. Then the water quality of the bath is very good, and the skin is smooth after the bath.
Then I was impressed by many employees here. The lobby managers Xiaopeng and Xiaoming, the concierge Wang Siyu (the name should be remembered correctly, modestly called Xiaowang), and the room cleaner Zhang Chunxia all provided us with very good service and help.
What a human and impeccable hotel.

There is a small train for children to ride in the store, and the children's playground is bigger than that in many shopping malls. No child will refuse to take a vacation here.

The experience of going to those Internet celebrity places is too bad. It is a pain to bring children. It is really relaxing and comfortable to play here. There are very few people on the beach opposite the hotel. Walk to both sides for a while. There will be more.

In addition to the welcome fruit, the management staff Wen Minghui and the waiter Xiaoqin are very good at their work and considerate, responsive to requests, and proactively provide unexpected services, so warm! On March 8th, I also received flowers from the service staff Chen Guangxin, happy! As for the service of the restaurant manager Cindy, it made me feel more about professionalism and professionalism. In short, it is a good experience to stay in Haiyue Villa again. If you visit Xiamen in the future, you should stay in Haiyue again.

There is a beach opposite the hotel, with few people and good scenery. This trip was on my birthday, and Xiao Ming even sent a birthday cake. The hotel's attentive service is really good! I will choose Haiyue Mountain Villa next time I travel!

Every hotel staff is very friendly and praises the lobby manager Xiao Ming and Xiao Wang, and the concierge Xiao Wu is indeed a five-star hotel employee. The hotel is very friendly to children. There is a free little train for children to dig sand toys in the children's paradise. Through the garden pool and through the underground passage, you can go directly to Huangcuo Beach. The beach is very beautiful. A few hundred meters to the east is Wild Beach 1/2. The four-person set meal of Xiangcha Palace bought by group purchase is really not good. The buffet breakfast is not bad and rich, and the lighting in the room is not bright enough.

msg:Let's just say, the service was good although the welcome fruit was a bit sloppy.

Service: From the patient guidance and polite inquiries at the time of check-in, to every time room service is needed, the little brother comes over with a small basket to deliver fruit, water, room card, and bubble bath...all are very active and timely of.

Free ride on the small train: Although it rained for two consecutive days, it was a pity that the small train did not run, but the little brother intern in the concierge depar**ent took us to the water garden in a battery car, and pointed us to the passageway to the beach.

Environment: The beach is just across the road, and there are couples taking wedding photos.
The whole villa is lush with plants, and events are held from time to time, just depends on the weather. Even if the sea view room is already in the 80s, you can still see the faint sea level from the balcony. If the weather is fine, it must be a good place to watch the sunrise.


Hygiene: There is no problem with hygiene. After cleaning every day, the towels will still be folded into shapes

Enjoy playing in the Little Dolphin Children's Paradise: It is worthy of being a children's paradise where tickets are purchased separately, and there are no fewer items to play than Baby King. It is that the staff can take more care of the children when they patrol the field. There was a child who cried for a long time without his parents by his side.

Summary: Hotel No.1 in the eyes of Xiamen people
Haiyue Villa, where Xi Jinping once stayed,
There is nothing to say about the service, it is very enthusiastic. Except for the one-key service of the room, which was not connected for the first time, it is almost responsive in the future.
The details can be improved. Generally speaking, as long as the weather is good, it is worth spending the weekend. After all, if you come to Xiamen for fun, you will easily want to stay in the hotel instead of going out üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÇüòÇüòÇ

msg:The hotel as a whole is very suitable for parent-child travel. The location is pretty good. It is very close to the beach. Every morning, lying on the bed, you can see the sunrise over the sea. The bathtub is also located on the balcony. Children can take a bath while watching the sea. Although the facilities are not new, they are well maintained. The naughty castle and the swimming pool naughty castle are a bit dangerous. There are service staff on duty and warm water is prepared for the babies. I feel that the children are very comfortable playing in it. The service staff are also very warm and thoughtful. I especially want to say that the housekeeper Xiaoming also has a room on the 4th floor. Xiao Zheng from the depar**ent did not arrive until one o'clock after we checked in. During the Spring Festival, the room was very tight. Our room was not cleaned up. Xiao Ming was very careful and found that we were very tired from the exhaustion of the boat and car. We specially arranged for us to spend the afternoon on the administrative floor. The tea room was cleaned, and the room card was sent here on a special trip. In addition, half a share of breakfast was given as a gift. The next day, the children still missed the afternoon tea. Xiao Ming learned about it and arranged for us. If you like to go to the executive floor restaurant or the breakfast room, just report the room number. Xiao Ming will give it The arrangement is really considerate, and I also gave a lot of suggestions for the trip. I like the room. Xiao Zheng is also super nice. My eldest daughter didn‚Äôt see the name on the badge. She went to ask the auntie what she asked for. I must give Aunt Xiao Zheng a good review. We because I stayed for several days, so there are a lot of personal items in the guest room. When Xiao Zheng learned that I don‚Äôt want her to move her personal items, she didn‚Äôt slack off at all. She folded the favorite animal-shaped bath towels for the children and sent them sand-digging tools. I was the first I mentioned it to her late at night because the pillows were too soft and I couldn‚Äôt sleep well. Later, I contacted the housekeeping depar**ent and said that all the buckwheat pillows had been sent out, so I was very frustrated. Because I might not be able to sleep well in the next few days, I didn‚Äôt expect Xiao Zheng to come after 8 o‚Äôclock. Knocking on the door, they delivered a buckwheat pillow and a latex pillow, saying they were "grabbed" and sent them to me. They also brought little rabbit bathrobes to the children. They are really super responsible and loving. I haven't been touched by domestic service staff for a long time. The above are all good impressions. Let me talk about what I personally think needs to be improved. 1. The breakfast food is not bad, but the experience is really bad when there are too many diners. It's all about the chaos of the "mother" sound scene. Let's make up your mind. I sincerely hope that there can be more restaurants to divert it. 2. The room settings are basically 1.8 double beds and a small number of 1.35 double beds, except for villas and main building suites. For more and more people now The second-child family is really unfriendly. In our family, there are two sisters who are not too old. They feel that they can‚Äôt sleep well. In order to let my daughters and I sleep well, my father spends three nights on a small sofa. Playing parents should all know that traveling with a baby is expensive. Parents really don‚Äôt sleep well at night and feel that their body and mind are going to collapse. Can the hotel replace the sofa with a sofa bed? We can‚Äôt make up for the difference and upgrade during the Spring Festival. It‚Äôs too bitter. Of course, it‚Äôs not bad. It‚Äôs okay to choose a villa or a suite, but after all, there are few resources and there are many people, right? In the end, I hope Haiyue can get better and better. If I have the opportunity, I will consider it if I have children.

The swimming pool and recreational facilities are very suitable for children to play in summer. The environment is comparable to a five-star hotel in Sanya. The villa area here is where the leaders live.
The decoration in the hotel is a little old, but the quality is still very good.
The breakfast is slightly insufficient, some bread, and the quality of western food needs to be improved.
The hotel is very close to attractions such as Xiamen University, Zhongshan Road, Zengcuo'an, Gulangyu Island and Putuo Temple. The overall evaluation is suitable for children.

The hotel is very big, there is a shuttle bus for walking, and a small train for babies.
The back door leads directly to Huandao Road, and you can go down to the beach. There are all kinds of plants in the hotel. The outdoor swimming pool is very beautiful, and it should be more popular in summer. The water in the indoor heated swimming pool is for children to play, and it is a little cooler. Breakfast is quite satisfactory, normal five-star level. The hotel provides bathtub film, which is very good!
The only downside is that there is a parking lot outside the room I was given. If you open the window in the middle of the night, you will hear the sound of cars and people. By the way, the air conditioner has a bit of a musty smell, it should be cleaned.
When we went out, Xiao Wu from the concierge took the initiative to carry our luggage for us, and also gave the children a souvenir of the little dolphin. Very heartwarming!

First of all, let me talk about the superior location. Opposite the hotel is the beach. You can choose to take a walk on the beach to order a drink at the Internet celebrity cafe, sit on the beach and accompany your children to dig sand and walk with them. It is very convenient to take a taxi for a small trip on Xiamen Island. Xiamen's annual Spring Festival fireworks can also be seen on the opposite beach without leaving the hotel. The guest room sister Su (Hongfang) is very enthusiastic every day to ask us what else we need and when it is convenient to clean... The concierge Xiao Wu and the front office manager Yuanyuan are very warm and polite. The sand tea noodles for breakfast are no worse than those of online celebrity shops outside. I heard that the hotel used to be the hotel where state leaders stayed. The greenery is very good and it is very quiet. It is very pleasant to walk in the yard after dinner. Remember to watch the sunrise! The sunrise and sunset in Xiamen is definitely a beautiful scenery that you can't miss

The housekeeper sincerely apologized and gave me two things that I was very satisfied with first. The plan lets me choose. If the schedule is tight, they will send it to me after washing, or if you are not in a hurry, you can wait for the washing and then check out, and give me a late check-out. It may take two hours to dry clean again. I chose to wait in the hotel and left after lunch. The clothes were well washed when they were delivered. The housekeeper didn‚Äôt ask for a good review, but he said it when I asked him what his name was. So, this incident left a deep impression on me.

msg:This is the second time I have come to Xiamen. This time I stayed in a five-star hotel. The day before the check-in, the housekeeper, Xiao Ming, would call us to confirm the itinerary and tell us some precautions for traveling to Xiamen. In about a minute, when we arrive at the entrance of the hotel, there will be a staff member who will help us to carry the luggage and send it to the door of the room. The location of the hotel is superior and there will be a beach at the back door, which is very suitable for taking children to play. Director Yang of the concierge depar**ent learned that we did not bring tools for playing with sand. We also specially prepared a new forklift and mold for our baby, which is really super good, it will make people feel at home, and we will choose Haiyue again when we stay next time.

Primary school students and friends participated in the story of plants, and got small gifts by finding plants through understanding. I also made an appoin**ent for a lawn picnic in the villa area, and the children were very satisfied! The transportation is also convenient, and it can be done within half an hour by car to the main attractions. It takes a few minutes to walk through a small park with an underground trail to the beach. Xiao Cao at the concierge is very nice. Every time we go in and out, he helps us carry things and call a taxi! The overall service of the hotel is very good! It was cloudy when we went, except that the photos were not beautiful enough, overall we had a pleasant four days in the hotel!

Shouldn't the hotel clean the room at 2:00? We waited for ten minutes, but we waited for more than 20 minutes in the lobby of the hotel, and finally got into the room. The takeaway we ordered couldn't be delivered to the room. We had to take it by ourselves on the fifth floor, saying it was because of the epidemic prevention and control, and expressed understanding (but When we went downstairs, we happened to meet a waiter who took a takeaway to deliver to another room, because we are girls who are easy to bully), besides, the room is very small and the lighting is just like that, the lights seem to be broken, and they are all turned on at night Still dark. Overall, I'm very disappointed. I was thinking about booking a better hotel for traveling, but I decided to book after seeing this, but the result was not satisfactory. It's better to live in Hanting for all seasons!

After raising my opinion, I changed to another house on the same floor, with less shade from the trees and slightly more sea views, but it was far from the label of a deluxe sea view room. If you stay in Haiyue Villa, don't go for the sea view room. There is no need to add this money.
All outdoor swimming pools are closed in winter. We made a phone call to confirm that the indoor swimming pool was open before booking. As a result, when we arrived, we asked that the indoors were just closed, and the staff said it was sunny... Since we didn't have lunch during the trip, we ordered food as soon as we entered the store, but we forgot to do it... I understand that it is a special period, but to be honest, it is corresponding The service facilities are gone, should the price be compensated?
The overall environment of Haiyue Villa is good, and it is very close to the beach. But there is nothing special about winter.

This time, we chose the check-in point that my family, Oppa, has been admiring and talking about for a long time. When I checked in at the lobby of Haiyue Villa, I didn‚Äôt have much surprise until I went to the Jazz Restaurant of Shuiyuan Villa, 180,000 square meters, 18 swimming pools, infinity swimming pools, heated swimming pools, and royal gardens. In one scene, there are small bridges, flowing water, strange stone ponds, lawns, lakes, and more than 20,000 trees and a total of more than 400 rare species.
Surrounded by green trees, the mountains and the sea facing each other, the fragrance of flowers and birds, and the winding paths lead to secluded walks, it is like a fairyland. I am deeply fascinated! Taking a battery car at dusk, the coolness of the evening breeze makes people forget all their troubles. Such a beautiful place like an outdoor Taoyuan with cracked walls is recommended. Five stars are recommended!
During this trip, I would like to thank Xiaolin, the handsome curly-haired guy at the front desk, when he saw our luggage was heavy, took the initiative to help us with the luggage, patiently and enthusiastically helped to solve the problem, the forgotten thing fell, and Xiaolin quickly helped to solve it. It's very fresh and everyone is as warm and friendly as returning home with a smile! ! Haiyue Villa will be a paradise for our family to repurchase and repurchase infinitely!
Finally, I would like to appeal to everyone, please be considerate to every hard worker in the service industry and don't give bad reviews casually! He and they are not easy, just to make every tourist have a very happy experience and leave unforgettable memories!

The drinks, red wine, and beer in the small refrigerator are all free, and the afternoon tea provided is self-service. It's a good deal to live here! The only regret is that you can't swim from the room on the second floor, but you can on the first floor! After I proposed to see the first floor, the staff member Chen Feng was too patient to contact the house, accompany us to visit, and the service was attentive! The next day, I still had to transfer to the villa to check in, and Mr. Chen drove to pick us up again. I was embarrassed!

It turns out that moving to the villa was a bad decision for our family!
Almost all the villas are traveling with children, it is noisy, and the front desk is slow to do business. The room is on the first floor to enter the swimming pool, but there is only a little fruit, only 2 bottles of mineral water, and drinks in the refrigerator will be charged, and even if it is There is a small yard that leads directly to the swimming pool, but I don't dare to swim during the day, nor to sit in the yard! We paid for the water garden for the next day's room fee, but moved from the villa to the condominium. It was really depressing, there were too many people, and there must be a sense of gap!

But living in the villa, small train, botanical garden viewing, infinity swimming pool, indoor heated swimming pool are all nearby, I like that kind of taste, it is very convenient to go!

However, during the National Day, all the staff worked very hard, and it was not easy to satisfy the crowds of tourists. Thank you for your hard work!

msg:I hope that the unpleasant check-in complaint experience I wrote can arouse the attention of the hotel management:

We checked in on April 1st and left the hotel at noon on April 2nd. The day we left the hotel happened to be the Xiamen Marathon, but our group didn't know about it. I called to confirm the reservation with me. The hotel didn't even propose that there will be a marathon on the 2nd. The road in front of the hotel will be closed, which will affect the matter of catching the train the next day.


When we took a taxi, the taxi driver kindly told us that the marathon would be closed the next day. Let us contact the taxi in advance. Whether I called the hotel front desk or when I checked in, I took the initiative to ask about the road closure of the marathon the next day. , how can we go out to catch the train at noon, the girl at the front desk insisted that the hotel arranges a battery car to take us to the accounting school, and we can take a taxi there (but then the fact is that the hotel can't use the battery car to send us to the accounting school let us miss the train)


When I checked in, there were 4 people at the front desk. I booked 4 rooms (3 standard rooms and 1 double bed). We were anxious to get the room card to go out for dinner. I urged the front desk many times to handle it quickly. The girl who handled it was not in a hurry , and the attitude is very bad. For a while, she said that my order could not be found, and for a while, she said that our order was wrong (saying that she only found 4 standard rooms). I took out the Ctrip order, and she said it was all from their reservation depar**ent. The person made a mistake (please note that she was blaming her colleagues in front of the guests), and when we came back from dinner, when we went to the room, we made a mistake again (we changed it to 2 1 double bed, 2 standard rooms), and let us wait to change rooms (please note the problem here: firstly, we did not carefully check the room number and room type when applying for the room card for the guests, and did not check the room type again after the night review at the front desk. Check), the check-in speed at the front desk is really slow, and they completely ignore the guests' anxiety


When the battery car took us to the hotel room, the girl at the front desk told the driver to tell us where the restaurant for breakfast was, but the driver did not take the initiative to indicate the location of the restaurant after taking us there


5. It was too much when we checked out the next day, because we lived in a villa area, so we called the front desk and asked if we could arrange a battery car to take us to the check-out formalities at 12:40 and take us to the entrance of the accounting school to take a taxi. The front desk replied that there is no problem (at this time the front desk is still insisting that they can take the guests to the entrance of the accounting school to take a taxi)


A battery car arrived at 12:40. I asked the driver if he was going to pick us up at the front desk to check out and take us to the gate of the Accounting College to take a taxi. The driver said he would confirm, and then he communicated with the walkie-talkie and let us After getting on the bus, he said that we can check out at the Shuiyuan restaurant, and then stopped at the Shuiyuan restaurant, and I went to check out. After checking out, the driver said that his car cannot take us out of the hotel, and let us take it After the luggage was unloaded, he used the walkie-talkie to call another car to take us out, and then something annoying happened. We were in a hurry to catch the train, and we waited for more than 20 minutes. I asked him many times if he could send us to the accounting school, and he said yes, and then another car came, and after we got on the bus, the command from an unknown leader came from the intercom, "Don't pull these people, tell them to wait In front of our group, the female driver of the new car said very irritably, "What on earth do you want me to do? I have already pulled them up, can you still drive them out of the car?" The intercom still said "Don't pull them, Tell them to wait for another car." Then, the female driver said that she could not take us to the Accounting Institute, saying that there was a stone pier at the entrance of the hotel, so it was impossible to send the guests to the Accounting Institute, but only at the hotel gate (from Shuiyuan The restaurant is only about ten meters away from the gate of the hotel. If you had told us the truth earlier, we would not have waited, and we would have walked there by ourselves), and said that the male driver had already told us clearly , it is impossible to deliver, we insisted on delivering it ourselves, and then started complaining about their colleagues in the team in front of us


Then, we were forced to get out of the car and dragged our suitcases and ran to the entrance of the Accounting Institute. It turned out that the entrance of the Accounting Institute was also closed, and we could not take a taxi at all. We dragged our luggage and ran for more than 10 minutes before we reached the so-called taxi. place, it's just infuriating


These employees do not regard the needs of customers as the most important thing, do not think from the perspective of customers, complain to each other in front of customers, and even complain to customers. A series of problems are problems with your hotel‚Äôs concept of treating guests and culture. You don‚Äôt put the experience of guests first. This is certainly not the first time that these problems have occurred among employees. Why didn‚Äôt the management find out? Because your management must not have done a good job in on-site management. On such an important reception day as the Xiamen Marathon, we did not see a single management at the service site. Whenever the management inspects the front line, they will definitely find these problems, but why are they indifferent? Because your management doesn't put guest's experience first in your work. You go to look through your online reviews, the customer experience and complaints are there, do you really care? A hotel that only relies on facilities and geographical location to support high room prices, but does not pay attention to customer experience, will not operate well!

msg:This is the worst so-called parent-child hotel I have ever stayed in! ! ! !

The air conditioner does not cool at all. I asked the front desk and said that it is a central air conditioner, which will gradually get colder. As a result, I didn't sleep all night, and it was terribly hot. The next day I didn't have the strength to play at all.

The service is all mechanized, you can't say it's bad, but there is no warm and warm side.

Check out at 12 noon, there is no room for negotiation. All the parent-child hotels I stayed in before checked out at two o'clock, and there was room for negotiation if they weren't.

The hotel facilities are old, and there is no bright feeling that a seaside hotel should have.

There is only an outdoor parking lot, and the underground parking lot is not allowed. Be careful when driving in summer.

There is no welcome fruit as well. Of course I don't care, it's just an extra reason for a bad review.

It costs more than 1,700 a night. If you invite me to stay for free in the future, I will not come.

msg:Stayed for two nights, one night in the water garden room and one night in the deluxe garden pool room. Talk about feelings:
1. The house in Shuiyuan is relatively new, but the musty smell is so strong that I dare not turn on the air conditioner. The facilities are really good, Dyson's hair dryer, the room is relatively large
2. Garden deluxe pool room. I really want to blow this room type, except that you can't see the sea, everything else is perfect. The key to staying in room 8152 is that there is no musty smell at all, not at all. Moreover, room 8152 is a room type that opens the door directly into the swimming pool, which is different from other room types that need to cross the lawn to open the door to the garden swimming pool (tips, 8148-8156 are all rooms with direct access to the swimming pool, only 8152 is a double-bed room, and the other rooms are twin)
3. Be sure to stay in the off-season! It only took 5 minutes to check in and 1 minute to check out. The check-in time is about 1:00. Later, when I go to the garden room to chexk in, I can check in at 11:00. The check-out time is 2:00 pm (in fact, 3:00 should not be a problem). You can also book a hotel tour. There is no need to queue for the small train at the door. Hotel waiters are responsive. The shuttle is on call. Really very comfortable. If there is almost no one swimming in the large hotel area during the day, you don't have to worry about the embarrassment of people taking pictures, and show yourself!
4. I personally think that the hotel is better than the water garden and richer than the water garden. Those who live in the water garden can ask to go to the hotel for breakfast

Let's talk about areas for improvement
1. Although it is off-season, the hotel's response to room service is still a little slow
2. The cleaning of the room is lacking. There are melon seed shells on the floor of the garden room and blood stains on the sheets. As a 5 star hotel it really shouldn't be. But my husband is really a very indifferent person. He just brought a line with blood stains on the sheets, and he didn't ask the waiter to change it...


Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Xiaozhu Xiaoye. Xiaozhu made an appoin**ent for a hotel tour. Xiaoye was even more powerful and directly upgraded the room type to 8152. Before leaving, I also gave a big üê≥ baby doll to the children. Sand digging tools can be borrowed for free. Overall, the flaws do not hide the flaws. The peak season may be gratifying, but the off-season is really nice. recommend!

It is near Huangcuo Beach, which is suitable for watching the sunset. The hotel is also super large, with green trees and a garden swimming pool. The external environment is impeccable. However, the hotel is really too old, and the rooms in the second phase are really cheating. As soon as I checked in and walked to the room, I smelled a strong old and delicious taste. Even if I like old antiques, I really don't like living in antiques.
Facilities: Whether wallpaper, curtains or lamps, paper boxes, switches, basins, and carpets are all aging and musty, it's hard not to think of poor hygiene.
The hair dryer is the simplest kind, the air volume is very small, and the metal parts that unwind the paper do not know how to open and change the metal parts. There are so few sockets ü•∫.
Breakfast: Today's breakfast is very general, the variety is quite rich, and the taste is very general, especially the sushi is very hard and unpalatable.
Service: No one greeted us. A waiter at the door asked us to scan the health code when he saw us, completely ignoring the luggage we were pulling. The bath towels in the garden pool have been gone forever, and no one has replaced them.
Maybe I didn't find the correct way to open Haiyue Villa, but this stay is really bad. Maybe the new rooms in the third phase will be much better. Anyway, the balcony rooms in the second phase are really disappointing and will never stay again.

I stayed in a mountain view suite for 1 night, a deluxe sea view suite for one night, and a 270-degree sea view suite for two nights. The rooms are large in size, and the decoration is old-fashioned and low-key. It is worth mentioning that the main building must be above the third floor to see the sea. The sea view is very good. Go down to the hotel and walk to the small garden on the first floor. After going out, take the underground passage and cross the road to Huangcuo Beach. There are not many people and the scenery is good. The hotel has an infinity swimming pool, an ordinary children's paddling pool and an indoor heated swimming pool. The breakfast is buffet on the second floor and belongs to the middle class. For Chinese dinner, you can go to the Chinese restaurant Xiangcha Palace, or a buffet, or a 7-day meal. Of course, hotel delivery is also possible. All in all, perfect for a holiday with kids!

Just a few steps out is the swimming pool of the water garden, with a shallow water area for children and a deep water area. There are a lot of vegetation and trees on both sides of the swimming pool, and there is also a shady place at noon, so you are not afraid of the sun. The swimming pool provides free swimming rings for adults and children, as well as glass boats, water bikes, and magic carpets for rent. The swimming experience is very good!
The service attitude of the hotel staff is very nice! Before leaving, the child wanted to drink water. A beautiful lady surnamed Gao at the front desk trotted all the way to the car. Finally, the children's plush toy landed in the hotel, and the hotel helped me find it and arranged to send it back.

msg:It is suitable for families or couples or individuals to travel in Xiamen on weekends and weekends. The overall hotel feels okay to stay. It coincides with a lot of family groups on weekends. The restaurant‚Äôs buffet has been planted for a long time, but the overall actual dining experience is greatly reduced. The ingredients and types are generally not as good as expected. The restaurant‚Äôs sanitation needs to be improved. It is easy to accidentally encounter water quality on the floor. Slip and fall (I almost slipped twice), I did not enjoy the room type upgrade that Ctrip ordered. Instead, I booked a deluxe garden view room. When I entered the room, I saw the roof at first glance, and the so-called garden view flew away. Finally, under the feedback and coordination with the hotel, I replaced the gifted moon cake coupons with the upgraded suites. Although I accepted it, I felt it was a bit unreasonable. The recommendation index is 3 stars.

msg:We stayed at Tongan Marriott Hotel for one day (originally booked for 7 days, because the room was too old and the breakfast was not fresh), we resolutely checked out early, and temporarily decided to exchange for Haiyue, which is still a decision for us. Some "adventurous" people, although they like rooms with balconies, are worried about whether the rooms will be more outdated. After all, Haiyue is a hotel that opened earlier than Marriott.

We chose a 76-square-meter exquisite small suite. The room type is very special, and the small details of the layout are quite thoughtful. The bedding that we brought is arranged, the aromatherapy is turned on in the bathroom, and the agarwood is used in the bedroom, which is very warm and comfortable.

Although the hotel is a few years old, it is retro but not old. Instead, it has the tone of an old house. The night is very quiet. In the early morning, the birds chirp in the forest, and the air is very fresh.

In the past, we almost didn't use the hotel's bathrobes and towels, especially in old hotels. Haiyue's toiletries felt almost brand new. This detail is very good. The presented fruit is really a big plate. The days will be fresh, and every day when I go out and go back to my room, there will be "little surprises" prepared by Aunt Wen, such as a little auspicious elephant, a little pig Peggy, an elephant doing yoga, and a pair of swans on Valentine's Day, haha, It was so much fun.

Haiyue's service is also very suitable for us. Xiao Liu, who accompanied us to pick a room on the first day, was enthusiastic and diligent. He introduced the hotel to us along the way. He was also very good-natured. I would like to thank Manager Su for taking care of me. In any case, I have a very happy one-week vacation.

I hope I can try Haiyue's third phase of "Waters" next time. I heard from Xiao Liu that it is very comfortable and beautiful. I can look forward to it. It would be better if the breakfast can be enriched. After all, it will be better to eat well.

Although it is a hotel that has been in business for more than ten years, the facilities and equipment are well maintained and there is no sense of outdatedness. It is a very qualified resort-type five-star hotel. The only point is to be deducted from the breakfast, probably because the room rate is not high. In order to control the cost, I feel that the breakfast standard is not high, especially the desserts are few and obviously not fresh, and the cakes and waffles are all dry and hard. I know it took a few days. In addition, I have to complain, because it happened that a certain leader moved in, which led to the closed management of the Haiyue Villa. Before leaving, I couldn't go in and see the beautiful garden landscape known as 100 acres. It's a pity!

msg:As a veteran five-star, the water garden I ordered, I have to say one thing, and I will complain about it. Generally, hotels renovated before 18 years will not be ordered. Unfortunately, my parents recommended it. I will try it and stay for three nights in a row.
1. The concierge depar**ent of the entire hotel has a full score. Answer the telephone consultation and the door of the main building, get in the car and open the door, and send the children dolls.
2 Worst Housekeeping! First of all, I said that there are no children's bathrobes, and I asked them to get them; I only had a piece of soap for three days, and I didn't change them, and I didn't provide them; I only had one pair of children's slippers for three days. I knew that there were children, but I called for the first pair. Yes, it was no longer offered voluntarily, and it was not replaced. Adults did. On the day of check-in, the balcony was full of ash and leaves to be cleaned. After flushing the balcony with water, the balcony was full of water, without dragging, the child slipped. Every day I go out and ask the room to be cleaned, but when I come back, the bed has not been made! Two quilts were placed in a mess on the bed! Every day! The towels that were still changing the frame on the first day were not changed! Also call for a replacement!
I have lived in countless five-stars, and I have never seen such a bad one!
There are still some that have not been written, and I have complained repeatedly in the hotel
Will not recommend to friends again
My coupons two days ago were deliberately grabbed on their official Weibo Double Eleven! It's not necessary!
It rained on the last day and complained that the child was sick and could not go out, so I sent breakfast, thank you
I used the best location on the Huanhai Road, so large area, I hope to achieve five stars, now even four stars are not as good, the software is really bad

I hope your hotel can help convey it through the platform. I sincerely thank the hotel staff for their help. Her first reaction to picking up the child was to see our house. The child didn‚Äôt stun to completely disregarding herself, and as a biological mother, she quickly responded that she did it. Later, the child was crying and asked the waiter to help us pick up the meal. These details were very touched and grateful for our family. The quality of the staff is really worthy of appreciation. They are super enthusiastic. They are also super distance-free when they see them for the first time. They provide tableware for babies very enthusiastically. In short, I will stay at Xiamen Haiyue Resort Hotel again next time. If it is not affected by the epidemic. After that, you must bring your family back in again. In addition, it is recommended to inform you that there is an in-store tour service when you check in. Don't wait until we know that the reservation is full. We hope that the hotel accepts small suggestions. Finally, I urge the hotel to help the breakfast restaurant. Manager Luo would like to express our family's gratitude to her. I don't know how her wound is recovering. I hope everything is well for her, or whether the hotel can help provide Manager Luo's contact information so that we can express our gratitude. grateful

It is quite hot in Xiamen in September. Fortunately, the shade surrounding the swimming pool on the water garden side will not be too sunny. The water still looks very clear, and there are indeed leaves that fall into the water. The service staff next to them will fish them out from time to time. Ordinary foam swimming rings can be borrowed casually, and there are also large inflatable toys for sale. After staying for four nights, the baby has to go into the water to play almost every day. It is very convenient to walk directly to the bathroom to take a bath. There is no way to have small ants in the house. It has not reached the point of being unbearable. It feels very comfortable to avoid the winter and summer vacations. It feels good to reserve a battery car to visit the park. The afternoon tea that comes with the water garden is a bit not good, there are too few snacks, no ice cream, and the fried chicken is a bit old.

The light water room is just next to the pool, we thought it was a poolside room! In the end, we were asked to buy moon cake coupons to upgrade us to the light water room! Very bad experience! ! Upgrade directly if you are sincere! Or get paid! It's weird to buy moon cakes! ! !

msg:The hotel is roughly divided into three areas: the main building area, the water garden (villa), and the villa. I stayed in the main building for three nights this time, stayed in the water garden for one night, and visited the villa. The main building is crowded and a bit noisy, but the facilities are complete. Two outdoor swimming pools, indoor swimming pool, gym, etc. The water garden is much quieter, the food, lodging and service levels are much higher, and the price is value for money. The area of the villa is very large, with gardens, trees and mountain views. You can climb the mountain and overlook. It's suitable for sightseeing, basically you don't need to go to the botanical garden. But there is no swimming pool.
In short, the hotel is highly recommended!

After playing, I can go to the indoor children's playground. The hotel also has a shortcut to the beach of Haiyuntai. After the tide ebbs in the evening, go to the beach to pick up clams, you can pick up a pot. What impressed me the most this time was Chen Tai'an, the security manager, and Ms. Luo, the manager of the Mediterranean Cafe. The service was really good. Hope the hotel can add chicken legs to them üçó. I told my husband that I can go to the hotel for a weekend vacation.

üßπSanitation: The cleaning is very clean and the service is also very proactive.
This time I stayed in the State Guest Building of the Villa, and the service was in place, and it was quiet and comfortable at night. At the same time, you can also use the main facilities, as well as your own indoor swimming pool. Take a call at a low level of travel. Also lived in the main building although it is convenient to travel but it is very noisy at night. Breakfast is in the main building, with a variety of fresh ingredients.

The children who live in the water garden are also directed to this atoll swimming pool. 1: Sanitation is not in place, especially the public area at the door of the room. 2: In terms of breakfast, I was satisfied with almost no seafood. 3: The types of afternoon tea in Shuiyuan are very few, especially the types of bread. 4: The hotel‚Äôs Chinese food a la carte is a special complaint. The overall is light. The boiled food is not fragrant or spicy. It is recommended that the fried pigeon has no juice and nothing to compare with the outside. After all, it is an old dish such as volcanic green grains. The dishes have no special characteristics, white rice is not good, the price is affordable but the taste is not enough. Generally speaking, I will go there. It is memorable to remember the past!

The staff was very service-conscious. Looking at the picture, I think that the poolside is the swimming pool with the door, but the water is actually hydrophilic. Breakfast was okay for two days with a little change. Afternoon tea was simpler. Dinner ended at 9 o'clock, so I ate more hurriedly. The next day I was looking for plants, and I was actually taking a stroll. The environment was really good. When we opened the door of the balcony, our room had a beautiful view of mountains and waters. The child went into the pool four times a day and liked it very much. Shuiyuan is on South Huandao Road. Take a taxi all the way. The night scenes are also beautiful during the day. The South Huandao Road is a beach with fewer people and finer sand.
