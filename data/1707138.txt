msg:Love this tranquil and scenic hotel.  One of the best hotels ever stayed.  Service is very good and room was clean, spacious and comfy.  The view of the Yanqi Lake is fanatic where you can see sunrise.  The pagoda next to the hotel was quite a view especially at night.  The landscaping is also flawless especially during the time I visit in Autumn where you see the colorful foliage.  The hotel is situated close to Mutianyu and Jinkou Great Wall sections which is very convenient for my hike in both sections during my stay. 

Highly recommend this hotel.

Knowing that we were all elderly people staying, she specially helped me choose a satisfactory room. At the same time, I disturbed her countless times on WeChat within three days, asking her to send a clerk to take us to choose a room and KTV room, buy fruit plates, add water, arrange the venue and the tower exploration trip, and check out, invoice and other matters. She was full of enthusiasm and professionalism, and she was patient and willing to help us. At the same time, I thank Mr. Xiao Wu, who has a slight local accent, for leading us to complete the "Exploration Trip". He was very patient and meticulous. There was also a young man wearing glasses, and Junjie, etc., who left me with a warm and embracing impression in the past two days. I like the service team in the lobby of Yanqi Hotel for giving us a great experience! I look forward to coming again if I have the chance! Thank you!

msg:If this hotel didn't have Kumamon stickers on the wall, it would be just the most ordinary and old standard room. The furniture is yellow and the mattress is easy to move. The cost performance is not high.

Facilities: There are many towel hooks missing. There is no place to hang bath towels. There is no reasonable surface to put luggage or items. The cabinet space is not large. There is no socket in the water bar. I don't know where to put the kettle. The overall feeling is full and not convenient.

Environment: The hotel's signature is that Yanqi Island is not open to the public and is independent of Yanqi Lake, which is quite good. But the room is not soundproof, the waiters themselves are loud, and the tourists are very noisy.
Booking a room from Ctrip can be used for free in the mini bar, which is better. Living in the so-called villa is far from the main building. You have to call a car to pick you up wherever you go. Swimming and fitness are impossible.

From the hotel's park to the room service, they are all friendly and meticulous. Especially Nicole and Junjie at the front desk can be said to be butler-style service. I hope they can continue to maintain it. The surprise was that I saw two little sika deer crossing the road on the road outside the hotel at night. I was so happy. I rode in the hotel for two days. The BMW mountain bike made the children have a lot of fun. If there is a convenience that I hope to improve, it is the recreational projects. It would be better if it could be more abundant. However, maybe each hotel has different focuses. The advantage here is that the environment is relatively beautiful and quiet, which is also what I like.

msg:Advantages: The hotel is on the island, the environment is good, there are many green areas, and the room fee basically pays for the environment.
Disadvantages:
1. The room on the first floor of Building 1 where I stayed this time is very, very small, the facilities are old, the bathroom environment is poor, the bath water will overflow all over the floor, and it is very easy to fall.
2. The bedding is not good, the pillow is uneven, and I slept without a pillow all night
3. The sound insulation is not good, and the TV in the next room can be heard when the volume is turned up. At one or two o'clock in the morning these two days, there was music and drums outside, which affected my sleep at night
4. The hotel buffet dinner is very bad, 298 per person, and I went there at more than 8 o'clock in the evening. The taste can be said to be very bad
In short, the cost performance is very low. It was my first time there, and I had great hopes, but
I was very disappointed. If you are looking for a good environment on the island, you can experience it.

Facilities: The hotel room is super large, soundproofed and quiet, but I don't understand why the balcony door is not allowed to be opened.

Service: The attitude of the staff is very good. I also gave a Black Forest cake for my birthday. The cake is very delicious, with solid ingredients and full of cherries. The only two things that are not good are that the check-in time takes too long to wait. It is written that you can check in at 3 o'clock, but you actually have to wait until after 4 o'clock. The front desk said that there are too many people during the peak holidays. I think as a five-star hotel, they should arrange staff in advance. Another point is that the attitude of the staff at breakfast is not very good. There are not many people for breakfast that day. The chefs who cook noodles and eggs are a bit impatient.

Overall, it is still okay

The Tianshui Pavilion buffet on the first floor is suitable for all ages. It is very suitable for family travel and is very cost-effective. If you stay there for dinner, it is recommended to eat the buffet directly at Tianshui Pavilion.
Service: I mainly want to praise the service here. We are four adults and two children. The youngest is only three months old. Because we need to share beds, our room was upgraded for free, and the two rooms are next door. There is a connecting door that can be opened, so that the two standard rooms directly become a two-bedroom suite, which is very suitable for communication between families. A bed bumper was installed on the bed and a crib was prepared. The baby was very adaptable to sleeping at night and did not cry. When we walked in, the hotel staff helped us push our luggage, and the service was very attentive.

There were very few people during the entire Spring Festival. Everyone had a very pleasant Spring Festival here and it was a good vacation experience. ￼

I called you at any time during your stay to help answer questions. After leaving the hotel, I also helped find missing items. It is a super five-star review. There was also a temporary need to install a fence at night. The service staff came very quickly. Seeing that there were children with us, they were afraid that we would need more drinking water, so they returned and gave us a few bottles of water. Very detailed!

The overall stay experience was very good and the children were very happy. The breakfast is very rich. Unfortunately, the breastfeeding mother is severely restricted in food and cannot eat most of it. I will come again for breakfast in the future~

The hotel's buffet breakfast doesn't have many varieties, but the Chinese and Western dishes are all high-quality, which is enough. Since it was the off-season when we arrived at the hotel during the Spring Festival, we were directly upgraded to two connecting rooms in the main building, which was very convenient. The afternoon tea was exquisite and full of ingredients. It could be used as a meal. The large floor-to-ceiling glass windows directly looked at Yanqi Lake. I believe that each season has different scenery, which is a perfect holiday experience. When we ate, we ate local specialties at restaurants outside. Huairou’s tourism facilities are in place, so you can eat well wherever you go.

msg:I went to the suburbs to hide away, and after searching around, I found that the prices for houses here were not outrageous. Place your order quickly. Yanqi Lake is a little colder in winter, but there are almost no tourists and it is indeed very quiet. The park is suitable for children to have fun. The service is also relatively good. The girls and boys at the front desk are very polite. The only thing is that the food in the restaurant is average value for money.

msg:Winter is the coldest few days in Beijing this winter. Because the rooms have many floor-to-ceiling windows facing the lake, the air conditioning can't keep up. The hotel added two electric heaters and the effect is much better. The view outside the room window is great, and the facilities, services, and breakfast dishes are all online. Although we know that Yanqi Hotel and Sunrise Oriental are both Kempinski hotels, it is recommended that Yanqi Hotel increase publicity on its own WeChat account and social platforms to let everyone know more about the beauty of this place. After the heavy snowfall in Beijing during this trip, the scenery of Yanqi Lake was particularly charming. It is recommended that you must climb the Yanqi Tower. I would like to mention here Mr. Mei from the concierge. He accompanied our family on the whole journey of sightseeing and climbing the tower on a cold day. He was patient, dedicated and professional. Thank you very much to him. Of course, Yuki and Nilore at the front desk are also very professional. I saw many beautiful moments on the island during this trip, and I want to share them with you.

The hotel has a swimming pool, and there is a small 38-degree hot spring next to the swimming pool. After taking a bath with the children, it was like a hot spring. There is also a children's playground, which is great for children to play. Before leaving, I climbed up the Yanqi Tower and found out that there is an elevator that goes directly to the 9th floor. The view from the top of the tower is nice. The young man who took us up the tower, Jiabin, was also very considerate and gave us a thumbs up.

There is no need to eat at the Guanlan Chinese restaurant in the hotel unless there are special circumstances. The price is high, the service staff is insufficient, the dishes need to be waited and urged, and the service is not up to par. You can't go wrong by going to the surrounding farmhouses!
The conference center and Yanqi Pagoda tour costs 200 yuan per person, the time is fixed, only 10:30 and 13:30 are available. I personally feel that it is enough to spend only 100 to see the conference center. There is nothing to see on the tower, just to see the whole picture of Yanqi Island

At first, my children and I lived in the parent-child villa, and the elderly lived in the main building.

Manager Liu of Villa No. 2 also took good care of the whole process, and the experience and feelings were very good. The park is very large, so renting a bicycle is perfect for a wide circle. Even if you live in Sunrise East, most people come here to play in the park. The only drawback is that there is no dedicated battery car from the lobby of the main building to Sunrise East. It may be that there is no dedicated road for battery cars. I originally wanted to go to the beer shop for a drink.

The room is large and the interior decoration level is in line with five-star hotel standards.
The service is pretty good. After the car is parked, the doorman will come over promptly to help with the luggage. If you need anything in the room, just call the hotel and the needed items will be delivered immediately. There were no shortcomings during the stay.
You can reserve APEC conference facilities and climb Yanqi Tower in the hotel for 200 yuan per person. I thought it was too expensive when I made the appoin**ent. After the visit, I think 200 is still acceptable. The reservation is made at the hotel concierge, which is next to the front desk. You can also make a reservation by phone. I got help from Jason and Bingao when I made the reservation. The communication was smooth and stress-free. Otherwise, I thought that 200 was a rip-off price. I won’t make an appoin**ent. Seem led the tour during the tour, and his explanation and service attitude were very good. After seeing Seem's high-quality service, I felt that the price of 200 per person was acceptable. When we went to the hotel to see the lights at the lantern festival in the evening, we originally just asked for directions, but a young man from the concierge took the initiative to drive us there in a battery car. When we came back, he called us and picked us up. Unfortunately, it was dark and I couldn't see the young man clearly. famous brand.

All the hot and cold dishes were terrible. My partner and I also commented on the skill of the chef who could make all the dishes so unpalatable. Most of them looked like pre-made dishes, and they were unpalatable pre-prepared dishes. We were not full and few of them could be swallowed. The dishes, not to mention the seafood, only had a few shrimps and scales, the variety was pitiful and stale, and no one took it.

msg:In October of the golden autumn, I took my parents to Beijing Yanqi Hotel again. Yanqi Hotel is located in Yanqi Lake, Huairou, Beijing. It was built for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference. It was opened to the outside world after the conference and became a garden-style luxury hotel suitable for leisure. It includes villas and hotels. This time we stayed at hotel standards. between. When traveling, food, accommodation and transportation are the most important experiences. Let me talk about my experience this time. The first thing is to eat. There are three meals a day, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Let’s talk about breakfast first. There are many kinds, a combination of Chinese and Western, which is the standard of a luxury five-star hotel. I have been eating Western-style breakfast for a few days, so let’s talk about it. There are many kinds of bread, including French baguettes, farmer’s bread, brown bread, and various toast breads; eggs include fried eggs, boiled eggs, and braised eggs; cheeses include Swiss cheese. There are hard cheeses such as French cheese, Dutch blue cheese, and cheddar cheese, as well as soft cheeses such as French Brie and King Wen, but the amount of soft cheese is small and will be gone if you go late; meats include bacon, ham, All kinds of meat sausages; the unique thing is that it has a burger DIY area, which puts all the raw materials for burgers together for you to choose freely. Lunch and dinner are all Chinese food, mainly Cantonese cuisine, which is quite satisfactory and has no outstanding features. What is distinctive is its soup, which is very well prepared and heated enough, and it is all clear soup. Its dishes use soup everywhere. It is the stock that enhances the taste of the dish. Secondly, it’s accommodation. This time we stayed in a garden-view balcony room, which was fully equipped and equipped with a coffee machine. You can make your own coffee. The drinks in the refrigerator are free, and you can also ask the waiter to deliver ice cubes. Third, speaking of travel, Yanqi Hotel is on Yanqi Island. Vehicles must be registered in advance before entering, and the management is strict, which is very good. More than 80% of the island's green area is green, and Yanqi Lake is vast. There is also a pocket garden surrounding Yanqi Tower in the hotel courtyard, which makes wandering in the center of it refreshing. The hotel also provides bicycles for riding in the park, and you can also go up to the Yanqi Tower to enjoy the distance. The hotel also provides boat tours to Yanqi Lake. To sum up, I think Yanqi Hotel is the best choice for vacation and leisure hotels around Beijing. Worth a visit for everyone.

The room has a good view, is tall and clean, the children's playground is very clean, and the toys are rich and high-end. The parent-child villa service is good, thank you for the thoughtful arrangement of the housekeeper Lucy and Ms. Liu who sent me to the car. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the air conditioner in the children's playground in the villa is broken and very hot during the day, and the air conditioner in the children's playground in the main building is also not working well. Overall, it is a great choice for family vacation in Beijing.

It is located on Yanqi Island, which is luxurious and private, and the garden-style greening integrates the cultural landscape and natural landscape. The hotel service is very good. When we saw us carrying our luggage, there were service staff who took the initiative to help us when we checked in and when we left. In two days, we tasted afternoon tea at Bowentang, dinner at Guanlanxuan Chinese restaurant, breakfast and Western-style dinner at Shuitian Pavilion. Service and food are impeccable. From the balcony of our room, we can see the beautiful scenery of Yanxi Lake, especially at night, taking a photo with Yanxi Pagoda under the lights and the Sunrise Kempinski Hotel opposite the lake is even more beautiful.

2. The environment is beautiful and the facilities are not outdated. Although the hotel opened in 2014, it has been nearly 10 years now, the hotel facilities and gardens are well maintained. The soap, shampoo, and shower gel are L'Occitane series, and the hair dryer and purifier are Dyson, which are of high quality.
3. Cultural a**osphere. The hotel was built for the 2014 APEC meeting. Follow the hotel island tour to visit the conference center and Yanqi Pagoda to learn about the history of the year. If the weather is fine, you can overlook Yanqi Lake and have a great view.
4. The service is considerate. On the day of check-in, due to the limited number of guests, I arrived earlier. Li Zexuan at the hotel's front desk and Shirley, the manager on duty, checked in ahead of time.
5. There is a sense of vacation experience, except for the lack of the sea, it can be compared to the first-line sea view hotels in Sanya

The package is very suitable, including accommodation, breakfast and evening package, so you don't have to go out for food. The extra bed was also very comfortable. Lucy at the front desk and a beautiful woman in red also helped us upgrade the room. Thank you very much 👍 I saw the beautiful double 🌈 in the evening, I was super lucky

The Yanqi Island where the hotel is located has a beautiful and pleasant environment, and it is very relaxing to walk in it. Surrounding water activities include Yanqi Lake Park (free tickets on weekend nights). Mountain climbing has the West Mountain Trail. You can also rent bicycles or visit Yanqi Lake’s landmark giant snail🐌Because they are all managed by Kempinski, we specially went to see the sunrise in the East, and compared them Each has its own characteristics: the service is very good, and the courtyard over there is almost full of cars, so non-resident guests will be charged 50 yuan for parking for more than 30 minutes. We mainly wanted to go to the dam, and the staff pointed out a way to drive directly there, which was very friendly. Each environment has its own characteristics. Dasheng is overlooked from a high place. Yanqi Hotel is more quiet and private. I personally prefer this place

It's a pity that the Yanqi Pagoda is under maintenance, and it is temporarily impossible to climb the tower. I will go again in autumn, the autumn scenery should be very beautiful

Secondly, the room is not small, the interior decoration is very elegant, there is a balcony, and the scenery is not bad. It would be better if the room had a screen door. The old man is weak, and the air conditioner is cool. It is a bit difficult to open the door for fear of bugs~
The hotel has a special lakeside leisure area, and the lights on the opposite side are beautiful at night! Next to the hotel is the International Conference Center, Yanqi Pagoda is also in the park, very close, suitable for taking the elderly, no need to go far~
I bought a pre-sale package with breakfast and dinner, which is very cost-effective, and the amount of dinner is not small enough for two people to finish it~
All in all, this is a satisfactory stay experience! I will come again if I have a chance~

     The hotel restaurant is very beautiful, but it is a pity that it is fancy but not affordable. Two small cups of freshly squeezed juice are served for each person, and there is no salmon in the breakfast buffet.

msg:Super five-star evaluation, it is a perfect accommodation experience. First of all, the service is first-class. From entering the park to room service, you can feel the details, smiles and professionalism. The license plate has been filed in advance, so you can drive in. Luna at the front desk was warm and thoughtful. Because there was a birthday party, she specially prepared the environment for the room. It was really a surprise. Since there were elderly people and children, she also helped us to delay check-out appropriately, giving us the greatest convenience. Second, the environment of the community is really beautiful. Although the park is not very big, the green design is superb and exquisite, and the landscape design everywhere is very eye-catching. I rented a hotel bicycle to ride. Due to passenger flow restrictions, the overall comfort is excellent. Thirdly, the hotel has complete facilities, rich breakfast and buffet, especially the amazing taste of baked pastry, you can choose any cake and snack, you will never be disappointed! The rooms in the main building are super large in size, decorated in a modern, elegant and comfortable style, and the natural environment outside the window is beautiful. The bedding is comfortable, and the pillows are moderately soft and firm. The water temperature in the swimming pool is just right, and there are not many people. In short, Yanqi Hotel does live up to its reputation, and I will definitely come again if I have the opportunity.

It is the first time to stay in the beautiful and quiet external environment. All aspects of the details are considered in place, the breakfast is more refined, and the night view is more splendid during the day. The hotel staff is very professional. From the moment you walk into the hotel, warm, sincere and moderate services are everywhere. Lu Chenyang who checked in, and Aike Li who delivered the luggage to the room, made our check-in experience pleasant, and we have the feeling that we have missed it since we left.

5. The towel and bath towel are very large, and the number of weaves is enough
6. The swimming pool is good, 25 meters long and 1.5 meters deep
7. Earplugs are provided, which solves the big problem
8. Wooden toothbrushes are environmentally friendly
9. The Chinese restaurant is great
10. Convenient parking
shortcoming:
1. The dry season affects the landscape
2. It is inconvenient to put the bathtub in the bathroom, so it is better to separate it independently
3. The TV looks very small in the middle of the huge background wall
4. There is no remote control for flushing the toilet. There is only an empty remote control seat, which needs to be manually operated next to the seat cushion
5. No hygienic bag
6. The breakfast is really average, sorry for other hotels with the same price, such as Rosewood, Bulgari, etc.
7. The chairs in the room are sitting out of the big hole, which affects the comfort
8. The doorman was a little dull, and he didn't help to transfer luggage when checking out
9. The bar and the lobby bar are combined into one

I guess the room service staff didn't see it when they changed the linen. It was already late at night when I saw it, but it was not cold , so I chose not to cover the quilt. The parent-child villa has a small children's play center, and the main building has a larger children's center and swimming pool. The children have fun and are family-friendly. The environment of the whole hotel is very good. The restaurant has Chinese food, Western food and a coffee shop. To be honest, the dishes are not cost-effective, and they have not reached the level of a five-star hotel. The advantage is convenience. The overall environment of the hotel is good. There are parent-child bicycle rentals, cruise ships, Yanqi Pagoda and conference center tours on the island. There are not many people during May Day, so it is a good place to go.

msg:At the beginning of the reservation, I repeatedly confirmed whether the children's room can provide three sides of the bed, and the answer is that it can be provided before making the reservation. After arriving at the store, I received a notice from the hotel at 6 o'clock in the evening that due to the size problem, it could not be installed on three sides, but only on the left and right sides. All the parents who have children know that the two sides of the bed are equal to nothing, which is useless and has no protective effect. Since the original intention of booking a hotel is to provide three sides of the bed, it is not accepted and requires a solution. The hotel's service awareness is not bad. In the end, after quick coordination, it was immediately upgraded to the master suite of the main building, where three sides of the bed can be installed. I moved over and saw that it was "installing" the bed surrounds on three sides. The so-called installation was nothing more than the service lady tied the bed surrounds with ropes by hand. It was not the correct way to install and combine the bed surrounds. Three-sided bed surround. It's better than nothing, at least it is the literal meaning of "three sides" and "bedside". However, it can be said that there is still almost no protective power. The height above the edge of the bed is very short, which is not enough to prevent children from climbing over, and the degree of firmness cannot prevent children from rolling over. In the end, three quilts were provided on the ground to prevent falling from the bed...
Opinion after living: If your company wants to promote parent-child business, first please ask a person who has actually raised and taken care of children to redo the evaluation of all equipment. In children's rooms, there are only children's decorations and items except for the bed frame, and sharp corners can be seen everywhere that may hurt children. In the name of your Kempinski, please do your best if you want to do it, otherwise don’t do it and just tell me that there is no such service, I can go to a good hotel instead of your home.
In the end, in view of the fact that the staff of the hotel's western restaurant self-service are very good, even if the bed problem is solved and the general set is changed, and the experience in the children's playground game area is very good, so there is no negative review overall. But the facilities in the children's room are really very, very unfriendly to children, especially babies.

Facilities: The parent-child suite has been upgraded in the store, and the room has parent-child layout and children's products. There are some children's toys in the public area of that villa, but the view of the villa is a bit ordinary, and it doesn't directly lead to the lake. You need to drive to the main building and other areas.

Service: The service is good. The front desk actively assists in solving difficulties and actively upgrades. The concierge is not rigid and can reflect a customer-centric attitude. However, there are conference teams, and sometimes parking at the door is random, and the mess affects the overall sense of vacation.
If you want to attract weekend vacation guests, it is recommended to separate the conference team and individual travel guests without disturbing each other. In addition, in such a large park, can some outdoor activities be added, such as children's slides and climbing, and some entertainment and leisure facilities.

The style of the hotel is elegant and grand. It is very convenient to stay in the main building, go to the children's playground, swimming pool, and eat! The location of the hotel is good, the scenery is very good, and the rare parents and children are doing it with care. The children's playground is very big and clean, and I am very satisfied. Looking forward to the next trip

From the moment I entered the gate, I felt the beautiful scenery and five-star a**osphere of the service here, especially the service staff Ethan and Coco at the front desk. I upgraded the room I booked to Villa No. 8, which made me feel beautiful and happy😃 The design of the room is Chinese style, clean and tidy, and you can see the beautiful scenery and lake outside through the window. Afternoon tea is super delicious😋Dessert🍮Exquisite, all kinds of tastes, gym, restaurant, swimming🏊‍♀️all check in for two days. All in all, I am very satisfied with this trip, and will visit again next time.

This time I came here temporarily, and it was snowing in Beijing, which is very artistic. Children like the afternoon tea in the lobby very much, and new facilities have been added to the children's playground. The children don't want to go home after playing. The most important thing is that the hotel service is as good as ever. Since Ms. Luna Lu at the front desk added WeChat a few years ago, she will greet you carefully every time she comes to the store, and her heart is warm every time she comes.

msg:Generally speaking, the entry experience is great, and it feels more beautiful outdoors in summer and autumn.
Service: The service staff in the hotels you stay in during the Spring Festival are generally very enthusiastic and considerate. Whether you are entering or leaving the hotel, checking in or checking out, or visiting the garden for dinner, the service staff are courteous and professional. The minibar in the first round of the room is free, and it is very happy to stay in the winter and make a cup of hot coffee. The next morning, the child went to the children's playground of the hotel to play for a while.
Facilities and sanitation: The guest room should be upgraded to a balcony room with a garden view, and you can see part of the lake from the balcony. Supplies are very comfortable.
Activities on the island: I bought a 100 yuan/person ticket at the concierge, and took a battery car to visit the conference center and the observation tower. The scenery on the island should be the top1 in the Yanqi Lake area, so it is worth visiting. Especially the place facing the lake in No. 5 and No. 6 villas is very beautiful, and the night view of the mountains and the sunrise in the east is very beautiful.
Yanqi Lake International Convention and Exhibition Center temple fair: I went to the temple fair on the second day. It was windy and cold, and the activities were average.

The quality of the Chinese restaurant is good, the quantity is large and delicious. The western restaurant is a bit inferior, but it wins in the large quantity. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, fried sticks and smoked salmon are the most worth trying. The service adheres to the consistent style of Kempin, but it is too stylized and lacks sincerity. It is recommended to ask the account manager of Lufthansa Kempin to train it. Here I must once again express my gratitude to Lufthansa Kempin's older account managers for their sincere service, which is neither too perfunctory nor too enthusiastic, which is just right.

Parent-child activities need to be increased. In the children's playground, attention was paid to wrapping the pillars with soft bags, but the storage lines that fixed the soft bags were actually cut short, leaving very sharp and hard points! He also said that the package is good, or it is not good! The child will definitely be eye-catching! Then because of the Chinese New Year, I don’t know if it’s because of the cold weather or what’s going on, the room is only 21°C...the bathroom is designed to be close to the floor-to-ceiling windows...I dare not take a bath. You have to wear down jackets when you go to eat, and the waiters are equipped with down jackets as standard...

I went there once five years ago, and it is still very new and well maintained. The management of Kempinski lives up to its name, the service is considerate, standardized, and thoughtful. Knowing that I want an extra bed, they even upgraded the room with a balcony. The afternoon tea was also great and the desserts were delicious.
Not to mention the shortcomings: the children's center closes at seven o'clock, and the children have nowhere to go at night during winter and festivals. There is only one Chinese restaurant and one buffet for dinner. The choice is too small. I went to the Chinese restaurant twice, and the food was served very slowly. The third time, because there was no reservation, there was no place. The waiter himself said that the food would be served very slowly.

Most of the leaves of the plants in the park have almost fallen. If you want to see the autumn scenery, it is recommended to travel before November.

①Shampoo: It's really hard to use, the shampoo is dry and astringent after use, and! ! ! There is a big hidden danger in opening the cover. The kind that is super difficult to open, it is difficult to easily open it with bare hands! There is nothing except toothbrush, oin**ent, and comb, and the hair dryer is especially LOW. .
②The room facilities are slightly outdated, and the TV is really small and pitiful, which is really not suitable.
③The quality of the bed is average, and the pillows are very comfortable, and there is no substitute (such as buckwheat pillows, latex pillows, etc.) Waste of resources.
⑤ The refrigerators and water cups in the house are not clearly marked, and the tea and coffee in the house cannot be refilled. One bag of scented tea and one bag of black tea, if we both want to drink scented tea, is it difficult for two of us to drink a cup, or to drink it? ? ?
In general, the overall is good. After all, the natural ecology is here, and the rooms are generally passable. However, as a luxury hotel, and it is a hotel that has held APEC and the Belt and Road conferences, the details are not good. , and such a luxurious hotel, whether it is the exterior or the interior decoration, is quite good, but it always gives me the feeling that people feel poor, poor, and stingy everywhere. . . .
[Transportation] Personally, it is recommended to drive there. It is more convenient to go to the surrounding scenic spots or the urban area of Huairou District. It takes about an hour to drive from downtown Beijing without traffic jams.
[Environment] Located on Yanqi Lake Island surrounded by mountains on three sides, it is also the main venue for the 2014 APEC Conference and the Belt and Road Roundtable Summit. As soon as you enter the island, the lush green vegetation comes into view, and there are countless beautiful gardens. Divided into garden view and lake view rooms, almost every room has a large terrace, according to their own budget, I think they are quite good. When I checked in, there was a little odor in the room, just open the door of the terrace to ventilate it.
【Serve】
①When you enter Shimaguchi, someone will check the reservation information and health treasure. I think it is very safe, and no one can enter casually.
②When you arrive at the entrance of the hotel, the master will guide you into the underground parking space (only the first floor is not many) or on the ground (follow the master's guide to park).
③ Entering the hotel gate, it is quite standard to open the door or scan the code, and there is also a concierge to help store or carry luggage. The check-in procedure is relatively fast, and it is also very standardized to check the reservation information, ID card, health treasure, and itinerary code. Check out was quick too. (The service staff are very polite and know to take the initiative to say hello, and there is no such thing as ignoring or losing face as said in the comments)
【Entertainment and sports facilities】
①Gym: The fitness equipment is relatively complete and professional, and there are not many personnel. There are free water and towels, and the hotel will control the flow of people.
②Swimming: I never imagined that, hahaha, in such a high-level place to receive foreign guests, the swimming pool is so unprofessional and small. . . So much so that I was not in the mood to go into the water when I came with swimming gear.
③Children's Paradise: The play space is very large, and there is a large area in the south that is sunny, but the play items are in two rooms, which is a bit depressed and not very good. It would be nice to rearrange it.
④SPA: It’s a little expensive and I didn’t try it. Let’s take a look at the pictures~
【FOOD】
Breakfast: The location of the restaurant is still very good, with a direct view of Yanqi Lake. But there are not many varieties, and I personally feel that the price/performance ratio is a bit low. Recommended chocolate croissants, maple muffins, sausages, boiled eggs, fried eggs, lactose-free milk.

The lights on the mountain are lit up, and the reflection on the lake is so beautiful. The breakfast is quite rich, and the meal has to go to the main building, and there is a shuttle bus to sit. The house has complete facilities, the staff are enthusiastic and well-trained. In the end, it is the management of Kempinski. Experienced swimming and children's playground, the playground is suitable for small children to play. Nice resort hotel.

You can choose walking, cycling, sightseeing car and self-driving for sightseeing around, which is very convenient. Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, the taste is good. The service is also very attentive. There are mosquitoes at night. I called the front desk at 2:00, and the mosquito repellent was quickly delivered.

When we checked in, the duty manager Shirley was very considerate and gave us a free upgrade to the room in the main building, which is more spacious and brighter than the original room, and the scenery outside the window is also excellent! Gave us a big surprise! When checking out, the little beauty "June" at the front desk learned that we were still browsing on the island, and eagerly took out a map to introduce us to the beautiful scenery. In autumn, the Yanxi Hotel is full of trees and is worth a visit

The younger brother with glasses at the front desk was very considerate and gave us more bottled water in the room. My sister sent each table individually prepared drinks, cantaloupe celery and watermelon cucumber drinks, which are very special haha. I would also like to thank Lillian at the Guest Service Center. Her care and patience helped me find the swimming goggles and swimming cap that fell on the hotel. After I left the hotel, I found that my swimming goggles and swimming cap fell into the hotel, so I called I had no hope of finding it back, but the hotel contacted me the next day and said I found it, which made me grateful. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the air conditioner in the room cannot be adjusted. It is 26 degrees steadily and the quilt is thick, so it is very hot.

msg:The environment of a villa hotel located in the park is super good. Each of the twelve villas in the hotel is unique. I booked two rooms and gave an executive suite. My son is very happy to live in a suite. He also said that it was the first time that he lived in such a large room. The living room, bedroom, bathroom, and bathroom are larger than ordinary hotels. There is a tea stand above the bathtub and you can drink tea while soaking in the bath🍵. There is a large bamboo forest outside the door. There are Chinese restaurants and buffets for meals. Unfortunately, tourists choose their favorite restaurants to eat. The fried dishes for breakfast are really bad and tasteless boiled dishes. There are more types of Western food. It is not very convenient to get off the subway and bus to Huairou Yanqi Lake Hotel. It takes five or six kilometers to walk. If the economy allows, you can take a taxi. It is not convenient for the hotel to take a taxi in advance. The overall feeling is still very good. Affect the praise of the hotel.

The doorman and front desk service standard etiquette is in place, and the hotel provides free upgrade to the main building room with balcony, free mineral water and capsule coffee machine. The breakfast buffet is quite satisfactory. There are not many kinds of food, but there is no problem. The shortcomings: the cooking level of the Chinese restaurant and the western restaurant is really poor, which is completely inconsistent with the products of the five-star hotel. Come and comment 😓 No matter how beautiful the scenery is, it still needs food to complement each other to be satisfactory.

msg:I heard that Yanqi Hotel has a first-class environment, and I was deeply impressed by this stay. Yanqi Hotel is located on Yanxi Island and is managed by Kempinski Hotel Group. Only guests who stay and dine can land on the island. The hotel, conference center and Yanqi Pagoda constitute the main landscape. There are more than ten villas scattered among the woods and grass, which are very quiet. Walking through it is like a fairy tale world. We stayed in the balcony room in the main building. The front desk Xiao Yang was very enthusiastic, helped us upgrade the room type, and took the initiative to introduce the various facilities and functions of the hotel. The price includes two breakfasts, and a mini-bar is also presented as an ice cream. The room is spacious and bright, the facilities are relatively new, and the balcony can see the side of the lake. The breakfast is rich, the dishes are fresh, and the service is very thoughtful. The black forest cake 🎂 bought in the store is delicious. A nice experience.

The room was too dim at night, and there was no desk lamp to illuminate it. The design of the bathtub is very strange, there is no way to adjust the water outlet, and the water can easily flow all over the floor. Counter staff and restaurant staff are very polite. The island is free to walk around, and the scenery is everywhere. This should be the biggest advantage of living here.

msg:Let's talk about the comprehensive experience of staying at Beijing Yanxi Hotel. I personally think that as a five-star or state-level hotel, the overall service and facilities, not to mention the highest standard, should also be a standard five-star registration. But the overall feeling is unsatisfactory.
Facilities: The floor of the room is creaking, the toilet is not a smart toilet, the sliding door of the dressing room is still broken and cannot be pushed or pulled.
Hygiene: The floor-to-ceiling windows and balcony of the room have not been cleaned for a long time. When I woke up, I found that there was a large yellow mark on the back of the pillow. Is this still in use?
Environment: It has to be said that the environment is still very hard work. It must be a hotel that receives foreign guests.
Service: There is no sense of service when entering and leaving the hotel door. When I see the guests have luggage, they don't take the initiative to help them. When they see an 80-year-old man entering the store, they don't take the initiative to help open the door. When checking in at the hotel, the explanation of doubts about the garden view and lake view (a difference of 1,000 yuan) was not very acceptable.
Meal: As a breakfast for 238 people, I think it can only be said that it basically meets the standard. The taste of the meal is still good, but the supporting services are basically not felt.
There are many bicycles at the door, and there are no discounts for the guests staying in the hotel, and there are charges. I really don't feel any home away from home at all.

Luna lu who checked in at the front desk quickly helped us with all the formalities. What amazed me was that she thoughtfully helped us upgrade the room from a garden view room to a lake view room when she saw that we brought children with us, so happy! Finally, I didn't forget to take out a hotel map, telling us where to take pictures, what time we can climb the tower and other precautions, and also help us make an appoin**ent for the time to climb the tower. Although the check-in time at the front desk was very short, it was just this short ten minutes that made us feel very warm! Finally, luna lu specially sent us to the elevator and told us how to get to the room after reaching the floor where we stayed! Entering the room, we were deeply attracted by the lake view in the distance. It was so beautiful, and our mood instantly became beautiful. Regardless of the heat, we couldn't wait to go downstairs to play! We rented bicycles at the concierge and rode freely in the park! The green lawn, I really want to lie on it. I ate dinner at the Chinese restaurant of the hotel. I ordered the Lotus Pond Moonlight Stir-Fry, Small Stir-fried Yellow Beef, Yangzhou Fried Rice, Casserole Old Tofu, Dan Dan Noodles, Fresh Mushroom Vegetable Soup, and the dishes were all delicious! The next day, the breakfast at the western restaurant on the first floor tasted good too. You can climb the tower at 10:30, and the cost is 200 yuan per person. I think if you are like us, the first time guests who stay in the hotel can climb the tower and take a look. Take the elevator from the first floor to the ninth floor, and the other floors in the middle cannot go up. ! On the ninth floor, you can look at the entire Yanqi Lake, as well as the Sunrise Kempinski Hotel, and of course Yanqi Hotel, the scenery is still very good! The child especially likes a hotel and is reluctant to leave after checking out. I think we will definitely stay at the Yanqi Hotel next time!

The hotel is relatively large, it is more convenient to enjoy fitness, swimming and catering services in the main building, and the villa rooms will feel quieter.

msg:Let’s talk about it first: the natural environment is good, the greening is done well, the area is large, and it is quiet. The water in the swimming pool is relatively deep. I think the deepest place can be 1.6 meters. It is very comfortable to swim. The water temperature is just right, a little cold, but there is a hot pool. Let me talk about what I think is not good: first of all, there is no waiter in the pool locker room, and his cabinet has an electronic lock, but there is no instruction for use, and no waiter can ask. There are slippers in the locker, but they will not be replaced after the last person runs out. I feel there is a chance of cross-contact. Anyway, I don't use their slippers. The rooms in the main building of the hotel are more expensive, but the rooms in the villa are cheaper. I feel that there are fewer room attendants in the villa. Anyway, I have only seen one attendant at the gate. Hotel waiters don't greet customers when they see them, which I don't think deserves such an expensive price. The hardware facilities are a bit inexplicable. The bathroom in the picture I posted has the door open from the inside. It is very inconvenient for a fat man like me to come out from the inside. I have to stand in the corner to open the door. I personally think the door should be opened from the outside. Looking at the door of the shower room, it opens from the outside, but the bath towel is behind the door. After taking a shower, you have to close the bathroom door before you can get the bath towel. I think this door should open inward. There is also a picture of the big hole, in the corridor of the hotel gym, it feels strange and scary, and no one has repaired it in time. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, the variety is ok, the taste is average, it can be accepted. In short, I don't think this hotel is worth the price. It's really good for meetings, but it's really not suitable for taking children, vacations, etc. If you have such needs, consider it carefully.

The only suggestion, the Japanese-style dry landscape is better to do less

msg:Yanqi is actually a rare high-end hotel in the suburbs of Beijing, suitable for family travel. This time, the family has booked three rooms, including a large suite. I still have some experience. I hope the hotel can properly absorb constructive opinions:
1. Environment: The natural environment is great. There are various fruit trees in the garden of the hotel, which is a natural oxygen bar. It's a pity that many places that should be flowing with fountains and babbling water don't have any water. This cost saving has brought down the grade of the hotel very much.
2. Service: Basically the biggest slot in this trip. It was a very bad experience from the moment I walked in. There were so many guests and so much luggage, but no one came out to help with the luggage, and the guard stood at the door just to see. The check-in staff are either inexperienced and clueless, or have experience but disdain to communicate with emotional intelligence and a good tone. If it's not a long way to go, just turn around and go home. I forgot to put the coffee cup in the guest room. It takes half a day to ask for a coffee cup. I asked for a few coffee capsules and was told that I would charge a single one. The training is not in place at all, and the service awareness is basically zero. For a hotel of this star level, it really shouldn't be.
3. Food: I am quite satisfied with this point. Whether it is stir-fry in a Chinese restaurant or a hamburger in a Western restaurant, the taste is very online.
4. Room: more spacious and comfortable. After all, the suite has been used as a presidential suite during the meeting, and its momentum is not lost.

All in all, it is a pity that this location, this hardware foundation, does not update facilities and improve services in a timely manner. Managers, please take care.

The children had a great time and left them with a very good memory. Thank you very much! ! In addition, I would also like to comment on the hotel restaurant: the brunch buffet in the hotel's western restaurant, Shuitiange, is quite good, praised! However, the Chinese restaurant Guanlanxuan is much worse than before. Adults and children do not have good comments on the Chinese restaurant. Not to mention the low cost performance, the taste of the dishes is still not very good. The most damaging thing is that the first papaya coconut jelly turned out to be It was sour. The restaurant changed its name to yogurt. I was speechless, and I don’t want to go to that Chinese restaurant again in the future.

Location: Located on Yanqi Island, the core of Yanqi Lake, there are also important scenic spots such as the International Conference Center, Yanqi Tower, and State Guest Villas on the island;
Environment: Really awesome! The lawns, trees, and roads are all very, very decent and beautiful, especially the summer garden, which is absolutely beautiful;
Room: The suite is very large, with Chinese-style high-end decoration, and the facilities are also very good. The humidifier and hair dryer are Dyson;
Service: It is highly recommended to climb the tower. Climb the Yanqi Tower and overlook the entire Yanqi Lake. It will definitely be bright and beautiful.
To sum up, there will be two brushes!

There is also a restaurant in the hotel that is a little expensive, but the taste and quantity of dishes are not to be said. If it is just a simple meal for a family, you can eat well for around 150 per capita. It is a resort hotel worth recommending!

msg:Because of the epidemic, I couldn't go out of Beijing, and I had visited all the outer suburbs. I suddenly wanted to visit Huairou again, but the journey was not far. After reading Ctrip's rating, I chose Yanqi Hotel. The whole park has a pleasant scenery, and the green design is also very beautiful. Special thanks to the lobby manager: Xiao Zhang in red. As soon as I arrived at the hotel, I was very impressed with her, and I kept watching her explain the map and play suggestions to the people who were about to stay there. I originally lived in a villa, and I saw that I didn’t drive a car with my children. After learning that it was inconvenient for us to take the shuttle bus, I helped to change the room in the main building, which made the trip a lot more comfortable and smooth, and the children were very happy. By the way, the child said that Auntie Zhang is very gentle. Speaking of breakfast, it's pretty decent. The swimming pool is big and the environment is also good. The only downside should be that there are really too few shuttle buses. The longest one waited for more than ten minutes. I hope the hotel will add more vehicles.
Thanks again: the warm and thoughtful manager Xiao Zhang!

It is more suitable for adults without children on weekdays. Weekends and holidays really become a family-friendly hotel in seconds. It's not that I don't like the lively, but this time I want to live a slow life, so if you come with the attitude of vacation and leisure, you should try to choose non-holidays as much as possible, and you can better appreciate the quietness and beauty of the entire Yanqi Island!

Transportation: Follow the navigation and you will be able to get there very accurately. There are also many places to play nearby, which is very convenient.

Hygiene: Hygiene did not say, no discomfort was found. Really want to praise it, the bedding is really rare! I usually recognize the bed when I go out, but this time I felt very comfortable.

msg:The environment is very beautiful, suitable for walking or cycling. The hardware facilities are very good, the rooms are comfortable, fully furnished, and the details are well done. There are not many types of buffets, but they are enough for five-star standards, and the quality is very good. The children's playground needs to be improved. The space is large but there are few things to play. There are only slides and building blocks. Nuoda's room is empty, which is a bit wasteful.

msg:The hotel, built for the 2014 APEC meeting, is located on Yanqi Island. It is picturesque and looks like a royal garden. It is currently managed by Kempinski Hotel, so there is nothing to say about the hardware and software facilities. Because the epidemic has not come for many years, this time I brought my children on vacation, and the feeling is as good as always. First of all, when I checked in, I was warmly received by Ms. Luna Lu at the front desk. Although we arrived earlier, Luna still arranged for us in time. A room with a better view, very attentive to introduce the hotel's services and arrange dinner. The hotel also provides buckwheat pillows, children's bathrobes, footstools, and unlimited mineral water. A young man in charge of the concierge service, although he had a foot injury at the time, still used a luggage cart to deliver our luggage to the room seriously and responsibly, and also thoughtfully arranged for us to send a children's bath set. The hotel's breakfast is very rich. As a German hotel management group, the sausages, various desserts and breads provided for breakfast are very authentic. As a parent-child vacation, there are two points. First, the swimming pool is not suitable for children to play in the water. Second, although the indoor children's playground is large, there are few facilities. If it is spring and autumn, these two deficiencies have no effect at all. After all, it is not enough to play outdoors during the day, but when the outdoor temperature is very high in summer, indoor parent-child entertainment activities are particularly important. Hope to increase some inves**ent in parent-child facilities. All in all, this is a perfect family vacation.

msg:A quiet, beautiful and pleasant island, suitable for taking family and friends to see the mountains, water and green. When you are in it, you often have the illusion of whether you are in Switzerland at the moment. The park is full of sense of design, every grass, tree and stone make you feel just right, vivid and not rigid. What is worth mentioning is of course the service of the hotel, which has really made "home away from home" to the fullest. From the moment I entered the island, I felt a different service. There are two security guards, one fat and one thin, who can't be named but warm, the courteous receptionist, the meticulous and thoughtful concierge staff, and the considerate restaurant managers Suger and Care, Xiao Jing. , and the service staff of the restaurant, because of the limitation of not being able to dine in, they are always worried that we will be boring to eat the same meal every day, so they always try their best to meet our requirements and help us improve our taste. There is also the vice president of the hotel, who personally drove us to do nucleic acid. And the cutest Shirly Li, who takes care of everything we can and can't think of. Perfect environment + considerate service, you deserve it✌️

msg:Wow, I actually gave it five stars, mainly thinking that there is nothing dissatisfied with it.
I have been holding back for too long since the epidemic. I have been checking hotels and B&Bs before I let go. I really read all the famous ones around, and finally chose this one.
Originally, I thought that as long as I booked fast, the epidemic would not catch up with me. Who would have thought that it would be too naive. Just two days after booking, a new round started...
I have been anxious for several days, and I plan to check the situation of the epidemic and see if it should be cancelled. Then the daily numbers are not good. Fortunately, although there is one case in Huairou, there is only one case. At least it looks safer than other districts.
Before I left, I saw the news that Yanqi Lake Park was closed. I also said that I couldn’t go after it was over, so I called the hotel to inquire and said that the two places are not together, and as long as they are not in the risk area, they can go.
So it finally worked.
The hotel has its own park, and you need to make an appoin**ent to register and scan the code when you enter the door. It feels very safe, and the environment is quiet and green. The hotel is opposite to the Yanqi Pagoda. The scenery is great, but you can't go up.
Just in time for the thunderstorm at night, I went out for a walk and watched the dark clouds roll over and the electric lights flickered, and I was in a particularly good mood~
All aspects of the room are the same as the photos, so I won't say much, but praise the children's play area. I've been to several hotels, and speaking of which, this is the bigger one I've seen. (Similar to the one in Ledo Port) The entrance is a hall, although there is nothing, but children can run, and then the two smaller rooms next to it are the building block room (full of large building blocks), and the other one can climb The kind of game stand. In fact, I am most satisfied with the beautiful view of the lawn outside the floor-to-ceiling windows of the large room, which makes people feel relaxed and happy [呲呲] Thank you very much for the help of the hotel manager Liu Chang for us

After the communication, the front desk directly upgraded the room type and arranged to check in immediately. The first impression was very good! The rooms in the main building are large in size and reasonable in layout. The hotel is on an independent island, and the surrounding green landscape is very good. You can rent a bicycle from the hotel to turn around the attractions on the island. I made an appoin**ent to visit the main venue of APEC. The hotel commentator gave a very interesting introduction. The children listened very carefully. The questions raised by the guests were answered one by one, and the fee was reduced or waived when I finally left the hotel. The hotel is generally very good. The service staff I see are also more professional. It would be better to upgrade the unlimited internet speed of the room and the variety of breakfast.

Special thanks to Luna for her help - we arrived at the hotel at 12:30 because we were so excited. However, the cleaning of the hotel has not been completed, and according to the epidemic prevention policy, the restaurant cannot dine in, and must go back to the room to eat. Thanks to Luna's hard work and coordination, we were able to check in in time for our lunch😋😋, which prevented me from lying down in the lobby with low blood sugar.

msg:I booked a lake view room for three days and two nights during the Qingming Festival. I was 26 weeks pregnant. I asked about the room type before making the reservation.
Due to the unique geographical advantages of the island and the location of the conference, the hotel has a very strong sense of design and Chinese style. In the main building, there are a lot of Chinese porcelain, paintings and scenery, which is refreshing.
I bought a conference center + Yanqi Tower landscape for 200 yuan per person. Brother Hong Tao explained patiently and left enough time to visit and take pictures slowly.
In the morning I go to yoga and my husband runs laps around the convention center. The yoga room has mats, foam rollers and small dumbbells. It is very quiet when the door is closed. It is just about 1km around the conference center to go uphill and downhill, which is a small off-road feeling.
Chinese restaurant please be sure to order the chef's recommendation! ! ! Highly recommend the fresh pepper lamb chops! ! ! The ingredients, taste, and presentation of his family are all carefully designed.
Don't look at the reviews. The three-cup chicken in the reviews are all affordable and only for the public. Be sure to choose the dishes with the chef's hat logo on the menu!

Worth optimizing:
1. The bed is soft, and I have a backache while sleeping. The design of the room is not as good as the appearance. The bathroom is huge, the toilet is small and dim.
2. The hotel's breakfast desserts or afternoon tea desserts are too sweet! So sweet! It's hard to eat it in one bite... It is recommended to cut the sugar content in half.
3. For activities such as visits or cruises, try to inform the guests to choose in advance. We know that when there is a cruise, it is already fully booked and it is too late to experience it. Other paid facilities such as battery cars and bicycles are not seen in more prominent places.

The hotel is located on Yanqi Island, and the traffic from downtown Beijing is very convenient.
The island has beautiful scenery, suitable for families and couples to watch the water, the sky, the mountains and the trees. The price is not cheap, but the whole park is really attentive. It is suitable for people who are willing to spend a little money to buy a quiet place to hide from the hustle and bustle of life in the city. Yanqi can be regarded as Kempinski's signature project. It is one of the best Kempinski projects I have experienced in various places. It has changed my view of this hotel group even more.

msg:To sum up briefly, the holiday price is not high
1. There is no sufficient preparation: you need to read the order first and then scan the code to enter the park. Of course, it is understandable that epidemic prevention comes first, but you can open a few more passages at the entrance. There are long queues on the road at the entrance to the park, which is very crowded during the holidays. ;
2. There are a lot of resort hotels, big and small. This is the one I am most dissatisfied with, because I don’t have a car. The buffet dinner in the hotel has a single menu. To be honest, the quality is not as good as that of a high-end business hotel. In the executive lounge, breakfast is even more difficult to describe. I asked the chef who is rice noodles, but I didn't know, Khan...
3. The room was not set in the main building due to his hesitation. The same price, the villa room is really not worth it. I am on the first floor, and there is a road outside the window. People come and go, so the curtains must be drawn at all times. Therefore, if you don’t really want it Quiet, it is recommended to stay in the main building, it will be more convenient to have meals and activities;
4. On the whole, first of all, the Yanxi Lake Scenic Spot is quite disappointing, so it is difficult to convince the hotel to focus on the lake view villa;

2. The room is cold and damp, the area is small, the facilities are old and the lighting is not good. The air conditioner doesn't seem to be able to adjust the temperature, it's very cold when it's on, and it doesn't feel worth it.
3. The afternoon tea delivered is good, but there is no table on the first floor, so you have to wait for a table. It is very hot when you go to the second floor, and the refreshment is also slow.
4. There are no entertainment items in the park. The visit of 200 yuan is to enter the tower and conference room, which feels very perfunctory. But the environment is good and the lawn is well maintained.

I originally took the old man out for a weekend to relax. Immediately after the room, I was out of the mood. The bathroom of the room leaked badly.

msg:Stayed for two nights and the whole family was very satisfied. It's far enough from the city to get a vacation, and close enough to save the trip. The number of guests is small enough, not noisy; and there are enough, not deserted. The landscape complements each other, and the ratio of natural and artificial is just right. All in all, everything is fine. Compared with last year's unobstructed view of the entire lake in the east at sunrise, we prefer this year's view of one of the lake's bays through the green pines and courtyards. There are blue waves, green pines, pavilions and distant mountains, and the scenery on the island is richer and more worthy of aftertaste.
Thank you front desk Ethan Yang. From the time I called to inquire about the reservation, I have always felt her enthusiasm. The lake view room and garden view room she arranged have beautiful views and are not far apart, which is convenient for us to take care of the elderly.

msg:I went on a holiday. The expectation may be a bit high, and I feel that it is not satisfactory in many aspects.
Location: The location of the hotel is good. On the central island of Yanqi Lake, the transportation is more convenient by self-driving.
Service: Kempinski's service is very mediocre. Many service staff in the hotel seem to be only responsible for opening the door, and the doorman in the lobby is very rude. I didn’t know how to ask for directions; waited for several hours for the service to deliver water; delivery of Western food and Chinese food could not be together; no house upgrade.
Environment: Hygiene and environment are in line with what a star-rated hotel should have. There is a gym and swimming pool on the first floor, and there are relatively few people.
Eat: The hotel has a Chinese restaurant and a Western restaurant on the first floor. There is no other place to eat around. The restaurant level is relatively average.

🧹Hygiene: The small drain hole in the sink is too dirty, can you clean it up? Seeing it frequently really affects my mood.
And the coffee machine is full of stains, if it is not convenient to clean, don't put it!

🔔Service: The auntie at the front desk is generally dumb, saying that she will call us after the room is cleaned, but it turns out that it is 3 o'clock, and no one has contacted us! In the past, the front desk asked and said that the cleaning has not been completed, and the children are with children on weekends. It is time for the children to sleep, and there is no place. Really bad coordination.
The buffet restaurant is very slow in serving food. When you have lunch at noon, no one will take care of you, and you will not even say "hello" face to face! Called to order food and told this meeting that more people will serve the food slowly. It takes at least 40 minutes to order a single order. I recommend ordering a set menu. Well, the set menu also waited 55 minutes for the first dish. I went for dinner at 12 o'clock and 13 o'clock. I finished eating at 30. In the middle, I said that the baby's noodles can be served first? After urging and urging, a bowl of clear soup noodles came, the noodles are warm, and the amount is just a big chopstick! Really clear soup noodles, a few noodles and a few canola! The key is so slow, the noodles are not hot! ! ! Are the sandwiches for set menus so slow? 1 hour is fine! ? Since you guys are so busy, does the little fat guy with glasses still have time to send WeChat all the time? ! And the hand that touched the phone held the plate with bare hands? ! Unprofessional, and extremely unprofessional!
 If you take children out to play, this hotel is not recommended, there is no baby meal!

msg:The epidemic cannot go out of Beijing, and the holiday is endless at the end of the year. I brought my family, old, and young, to Yanqi Lake to play. I booked two rooms for two nights. The harvest may be the most satisfying holiday this year. First of all, Yanqi Hotel is managed by Kempinski, with first-class management level, room service responsive, and quick and convenient check-in. Second, the room facilities are excellent. The room may be equipped with underfloor heating. In such a cold Beijing winter, we actually need to turn off the air conditioner to sleep. Third, the dining is excellent. Dad doesn't want to drive out of the island to eat. We have almost three meals at the hotel. The breakfast is a buffet, which is extremely rich. It is definitely ranked among the five-star hotels in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Supermarket where I have stayed. The lunch tastes very good in the Chinese restaurant too! The signature boiled beef is very fragrant and rotten. The western restaurant for dinner is a la carte, with baby meals, which are also delicious. Fourth, there are plenty of entertainment facilities. At first, I came to the tennis court and played a game of tennis with my husband in the mountains and rivers. In Beijing, where tennis courts are scarce, it is simply an enjoyment that money can't buy. The swimming pool is also very good, and there is a small pool with warm water for babies to play, and the children’s club facilities are also good. It is enough for a baby over one year old, not to mention the green mountains and green waters on the island can run wild. In short, this is a poetic and modern hotel, with a perfect fusion of Eastern and Western cultures, and a perfect fusion of classic and modern. In my mind, it is second only to the existence of the peninsula of Bangkok.

As the weather is getting colder at night, the hotel specially arranged an electric heater for the room and added a quilt, which is very heartwarming. The hotel is located on Yanqi Island, with green mountains and green waters, green grass, and the autumn colors are getting thicker. The environment is secluded and refreshing. You can enjoy the autumn colors without going out of the island. It is suitable for relaxing vacations.

Walking in the park in the morning and evening is refreshing. The front desk staff were warm and thoughtful, and the introduction was very specific; the rooms are spacious and comfortable, whether it is a garden-view room or a lake-view room, there are unique scenery; the corridor is high-end and a**ospheric, wide and unique. Maybe it's because there are not many guests staying on weekdays, and the breakfast is a bit monotonous. All in all a recommended hotel.

The baby’s evaluation of Yanqi Hotel is even better for eating, living and viewing. The room is great, the big balcony is great, especially at night, it’s really a pleasure to stand on it and watch the night view. Of course, the price is higher haha, but it’s worth it, and the service is also very good. The breakfast is okay, the variety is complete, but there are no highlights. The tour guide on the island felt that the explanation was not very good, and the words were not very clear because of wearing a mask. Overall it is very good. Generally, evaluation is not written, so I think I should write a little bit for your reference.

msg:Fortunately, I didn't do something that would make me regret forever! The best hotel around Yanqi Lake, no one. On Yanqi Island, the island has a beautiful environment and a magnificent garden design. The high-end Belt and Road APEC Conference Center is also on the island, and there is Villa No. 4 where *** stayed. The front desk booked a tour to visit the conference center and climb the Yanqi Tower to see the panoramic view. It cost 200 yuan per person, which seems a little expensive, but after the visit and listening to the explanation, I felt that it was worth the money. The hotel is very beautiful, the room is large, and the bathroom is luxurious. A family of three added a bed and it was still very spacious. The extra bed included breakfast, which is suitable for a family of three to travel with a big child. After talking about the advantages, let's talk about the shortcomings: First, the check-in was too slow. We arrived at 2:30 and the hygiene was not cleaned until 4 o'clock. Second, there were mosquitoes in the room. It was useless to turn on the electric mosquito coil because the room was too big and one bottle was not enough to reach the concentration. And there were too few wall sockets in the room. Even if there was another bottle, there was no place to plug it. I was bitten by four bags and didn't sleep well all night. Third, the breakfast was average, and there was nothing delicious. In short, if you ignore the mosquito bites and don't have high requirements for food, it is still a very good travel experience.

When he took us to visit the International Conference Center, he not only explained the design, function and three conference scenes of the building actively, enthusiastically and in detail, but also took the initiative to help us take pictures group photo. When I was cycling around the hotel, I carefully introduced the hotel’s attractions, the overview of the 12 villas, and the essentials of riding this BMW bicycle. And provide me with a tour map and mineral water.
Finally, I would like to thank the "Sister Guo" of the housekeeping depar**ent for telling me the various switches in the room in detail and patiently, and actively assisting the electrician to fix a minor fault. And asked my mother to pay attention to her feet and not to slip.
In short, through these three staff, we feel the warm and thoughtful service. Thank them again!

msg:The APEC summit and the "Belt and Road" international summit are held in a beautiful surrounding environment. There is only one entrance and exit on the island (to the hotel), so the safety is needless to say. The hotel's Chinese style design is elegant and a**ospheric. The various services are also very good, the reception depar**ent is patient and meticulous, the concierge depar**ent’s reservation instructions are clear, the Chinese and Western food depar**ents are warm and thoughtful, and the room service responds quickly, which is impressive. All dinners are eaten in Chinese restaurants, including Cantonese and Sichuan cuisines. The ingredients are fresh and the taste is good. The rooms are clean and the guest supplies are up to the hotel's grade. Some suggestions: 1. Because the room is close to nature, mosquitoes and flies will inevitably enter in summer. It is recommended that the room be equipped with a mosquito and fly lamp or insect repellent spray, which can facilitate the guests to kill themselves and avoid staining the wallpaper; 2. It is recommended that the bathroom A small desk can be set up next to the phone, so that guests can put their handy items, such as mobile phones. Overall, this is a very satisfying experience.

msg:The entire hotel is in a large garden, and the environment is very good.
The interior of the room is a bit dated. We were arranged on the first floor of Villa No. 9, which felt a bit like a premium guest house, and the style was a bit not suitable for the big environment.
But the mosquito repellent and insect repellent in the room are pretty good, and overall it's okay.
Please pay attention to the hygiene of the Chinese restaurant. Although the problem can be solved after the problem occurs, it is a bit congested after all, especially for children and the elderly. The reason why you choose a good hotel is to hope that it can be clean.

The hotel is like a large garden surrounded by mountains, very quiet, and the conference center is extraordinary. We booked the main building. The room has a balcony on the first floor. The decoration is a bit dark, but it is quite spacious and there is also a cloakroom. The restaurant is on the ba*****t level. Breakfast is in the Water Heaven Pavilion, and dinner is in the Guanlan Chinese Restaurant. The interior is decorated with high grades, and you can admire Yanqi Lake. The dishes are light and taste good. The grilled rainbow trout is a little expensive.

msg:First of all, the environment: I really don't have to say, although it rained during the check-in time, but after the rain, there is a special scene. The overall garden design style should be Taoist culture, the green coverage rate is very high, and the island is surrounded by lake water, which is very comfortable.
Service: It is managed by Kempinski, and the level of domestic service should be very high. Someone takes the initiative to say hello, opens the door and carries luggage. Because I was celebrating my baby’s birthday, I called and asked if I could simply decorate it, because there was no themed room that day, I did give us a simple decor after entering, and also gave our baby a small cake. I would also like to commend Zhao Lirong for knowing that there is a baby who checked in early, and he took the initiative to help me with late check-out. Thanks again!
Breakfast: I feel pretty good. The service can keep up. I take the initiative to collect plates and make coffee. There are more categories and it’s delicious.
Activity center: I only went to the children’s center, which is very suitable for babies to play
The only complaint may be the toothbrush. For the sake of environmental protection, the wooden toothbrush used will shed hair when brushing your teeth.

1.中午在酒店西餐廳點了一份🍕等待一小時才上，我們是第一桌來的，餐廳當時總共衹有三桌，服務人員站在一起聊天很閑，不知道為何上菜這麼慢，沒有服務人員作出解釋；
2.晚餐選擇的酒店中餐廳，那麼大個🖥️立在門口做宣傳，坐下告知你沒有小龍蝦，我説正是季節呀，服務人員也並沒有作出任何解釋，沒有就請不要虛假宣傳好嘛，真的很掃興；
3.你在酒店公共區域所看到的玻璃門，能通往園區的，95%以上的是打不開的，都得繞一個門走，在中餐廳等菜期間想出去看一下雁棲湖，門近在咫尺，餐廳與景色一門之隔，經理無理由拒絕開門，要看可以的，要求你從中餐廳出去從西餐廳繞到園區，如果怕🦟我説我可以出去隨手關門，經理説如果我這樣做大家都會學我，好好笑，閉門器滅蚊燈等等就可以解決的問題，為了省公費或是懶強行解釋，真沒必要這樣吧，夏天怕蚊蟲，冬天怕冷，乾脆酒店密閉起來好了呀，那裡做🚪幹什麼呢，全部封閉把住客都圈起來好了，，，好不容易繞到室外園區，室外也沒有任何位置配備了煙灰缸；
4.酒店的娃娃機，充完錢才發現它的玩具都擺在連爪子都根本挨不上的邊邊位置，酒店的ktv，燈也沒有開，總之入住體驗非常差，三四千一晚性價比真的很低，為啥這是排名前三的度假酒店？？？

msg:房間中規中矩，勝在園林景色，天氣好的時候真是太美了，感覺住在這裏比凱賓斯基景色好啊
第二天遊覽APEC會址、登雁棲塔，俯瞰雁棲湖和園林景色，美不勝收。帶隊講解的酒店禮賓部工作人員非常會講，繪聲繪色。園區內較大，沒有住在主樓，但可以隨時叫電瓶車接送
酒店早餐也挺豐盛的，贈送兩支文創冰淇淋，説是哈根達斯的，但味道也就那樣，比較甜
略感不足是游泳池水質一般

msg:帶孩子入住一天主樓，體驗一下2800的房間和雁棲島的環境，先説優點，服務是真不錯，從下車到領房卡，都是微笑+主動服務，房內絕大部分設施都比較有檔次，整個島內環境也非常好，能體現出非常高的級別。缺點也很致命，酒店因為挨着湖，而且綠化很好，所以蚊子比較多，這個級別的酒店應該想到這個情況，夏天應該最起碼可以有快拆蚊帳可以選擇，哪怕付費的也好，否則你在2800一晚的酒店就能體會到夜不能眠的感覺，雖然配了薰蚊液，但房間裏幾乎沒有什麼作用。
第二點，早晨從八點多就開始有除草機在窗外轟鳴，長達2個多小時，雖然已經八點左右，但畢竟是度假遊客很多，有很大一部分來這裡是度假的，並不是隨旅遊團起大早的，就算不睡懶覺，在屋裡也震的頭髮蒙，很影響休息，這些都是細節，總之，環境很好，服務很好，但睡不好，噪音大，也會很影響住宿心情。大環境雖然值這個價，但細節上差強人意，最起碼我感覺是這樣。下面有視頻，這個噪音大家能接受也就當我事多沒説就行。

msg:母親節錯峯帶母上大人和娃去雁棲酒店兩天一夜。在攜程買的2388元套餐，兩天一夜，包含一頓晚餐和一頓早飯。我之前也在日出東方和雁棲酒店之間糾結很久，後來發現日出東方靠雁棲酒店景觀這邊的房間價格簡直要趕上雁棲酒店價格了，那我為什麼不直接住進美景裏？！
作為近年為大國主場外交而設計建設的酒店，絕對秒殺一大堆酒店。車還沒進酒店園區就已經能感受到景觀的變化，美，就是最直觀的感受！目之所及盡是美景，且美景各不相同，如同中國景觀畫一樣。
酒店由凱賓斯基管理運營，服務沒話説。房卡外觀是木製的，很有意思。房間很大，在網上預訂可以看到主樓房間和別墅區房間，建議選主樓，景觀很好，且方便。從房間陽台和窗户看出去，就是一幅幅中國園林畫，心情無比清爽。房間很大，mini吧免費飲品很多種，好像有八瓶，可樂、橙汁、雪碧、芬達、啤酒、蘇打水什麼的，還有一袋堅果和mm豆。免費礦泉水也很多，給了四瓶還是六瓶，我們中午入住，喝了兩瓶，結果下午吃完飯回房間，礦泉水又給我們補滿了。
咖啡廳：在主樓提供下午茶和各種餅乾、飲品的零售，味道不錯。
小童中心：崽崽很喜歡，第一天玩了兩個多小時不願意出來。第二天又心心念念小童中心，從上午10:40一直玩到下午3:30，因為錯峯，娃很少。
游泳池：沒進去，不評價。
娛樂：大廳可以預訂觀光自行車，三人座（其實可以坐兩大兩小）自行車是一小時150元，還有六人座等。園區騎車看風景很舒服，因為風景很美。還可預約參觀塔和***主場外交的會場，好像是200元／人，不過塔在維修不能去，會場一天衹有兩次開放時間，我們不太感興趣，就沒去。
晚餐：在中餐廳就餐，預訂的套餐裏包了一頓晚餐，二選一套餐，味道很好，種類豐富，量比預期多，參見圖14。
早餐：自助，中西餐都有，種類比較多。

值得一提的是服務，辦入住的時候先好了一間就安排長者先去休息，長者不需要空調，大開着陽台門屋裡温度還是23℃左右，覺得冷。前台的小夥子很痛快一下把兩間都換到朝南的房間，還讓我們不用考慮需要重新整理房間的事。平時在大堂看到我給長者推輪椅也會有服務員來問要不要幫忙，因為有地毯怕不好推。總之非常體貼的服務，不是表面程式化那種。

msg:酒店各方面都很不錯，當然價錢也十分美麗！好像是疫情開始之後吧，國內酒店也動輒兩三千算便宜了！
説説感受吧，酒店最大的賣點應該是環境，作為當年重要會議的舉辦地，環境工程應該説沒什麼可挑剔，那麼大一個園子，國內可能也不多見，至少我印象中是住過有着最大園區的酒店！住酒店其實最重要的還在服務，花錢不怕，至少得讓人覺得物有所值，這點雁棲酒店做的不錯，提前半個月訂房，後來在X團看到了比我訂的一間房低300多的房價，頓時覺得不平衡，坑爹的攜程又不能改，所以找到酒店，酒店方面耐心解釋了差別，原來價格雖然低，但是房間面積也縮水差不多一半！
説到房間面積，67平面的標準間應該是我住過最大的標間了，房間設施也算不錯，床具很好，高支紗床品睡覺很舒服；有人好像吐槽這個價格的酒店還不是智能馬桶，我到是覺得馬桶的用瓷質地高級，符合德系注重內在品質甚於表面功夫的作風！衹是台上盆的水龍頭實在有點坑，太長，還不能動，一開始磕了好幾次腦袋！
住了兩天，因為酒店的地理環境，所以六頓飯都在酒店解決，早餐我覺得不錯，該有的都有了，因為是週一週二，人也不多，對於我這種人多恐懼症患者是非常舒服的就餐環境！中餐廳味道做的也不錯，第一天晚飯點了三杯雞，上來和之前吃到的不太一樣，還因為是改良了，結果餐廳經理説是做的有問題，然後主動給免單了，還送了一大盤水果，真的很實在，真的沒話説！
當然小毛病也是有的，不過反映後都得到了及時解決，最後退房結賬的時候也向前台經理反饋了一下，結果還送了紅酒，又有點感動，總體而言非常滿意，必須給五星了！

最後必須吐槽一下攜程！不知道什麼起學會了全款預付！疫情當下，真不知道萬一不能成行是不是還得和他打官司！

訂之前看到攜程上有的差評，有點猶豫。然而問過身邊來過幾次的朋友，説推薦很棒，那就訂這裏咯。來之後，不愧是開過APEC的地方，有特色並且獨享這個島。整個酒店園區乾淨漂亮高級，房間早晚無敵view，早餐下午茶晚餐無敵view，走到湖邊更不用説了無敵view。工作人員熱情有效率，我説不着急的東西也很快就給送到房間。早餐晚餐下午茶都符合這個價位。
一定會再來！

🍁主樓房間很大，配有陽台可以欣賞園景和湖景，還能看到日出東方酒店😄健身房的器械都是life fitness高配版，連擼兩天感覺超棒👏餐廳另行評價
🍀細緻周到的服務絕對讓人心情愉悦，疫情的緣故，前台辦理入住需要花費更多的時間，且我們一行入住人數較多，手續繁瑣，Luna Lu小姐姐特別温柔，工作有條不紊，特別巧退房時也是Luna接待我們，熱情細心，服務真的令人滿意

房間很值得欣賞，一桌一椅都有設計和淵源。內庭院能看到日出東方，靜謐大氣，品質滿滿。可惜晚上回來去游泳忘了看看夜景如何。
唯一不足的就是游泳池更衣間好臭😭 憋口氣換了衣服。另外這畢竟是給會議配套的，小孩的親子設備就差了一些，沒有寶寶浴袍 拖鞋 洗浴用品和小馬桶圈之類的。如果增加親子服務可能會更好哦。

msg:預訂雁棲酒店是因為看評分比較高。開始預訂的是雙床房，單價每晚3274元，開房後覺得窗外沒有景色，經申請換成湖景雙床房，每晚單價加1190元，合計單價每晚4464元，這在北京城區都算比較貴的。經實地體驗，整體覺得性價比不高。
先説優點：1、地處雁棲湖邊，得天獨厚的島嶼形狀，四面環水；2、建築設計有特點。
缺點很多：1、如此價格的房間，床墊質量很差；衹要是雙床房都沒有智能馬桶，有歧視嫌疑；淋浴室地漏有點兒堵，流水不長，腳面一下都泡在水裡；沒有棉簽。2、早餐單價298元，海鮮、河鮮、湖鮮都沒有（懷柔盛產虹鱒魚）；果汁也不是鮮榨的。3、服務員整體服務素質和水平比較低（這在郊區很普遍，可能有找不來人員問題）。4、房間非常不隔音，大半夜總有人吵鬧，也不見有管理人員制止。
最後要説的是，懷柔區早就確定為“生態涵養區”，有些服務不提供決不能拿環保説事兒。否則，周邊酒店都應該關停。

msg:酒店的環境和景色沒的説，依山傍水，很適合度假。但是體驗下來最大的感受就是這個酒店沒有能力接待過多的客人。

衹是一個普通週日，入住就排大隊，等待時間半個小時起步，我等了將近50分鐘，站的腿痠疼，排隊的還有長者，酒店沒有任何安撫措施，前面的客人辦不了，也不告知，後面的客人就一直在等待，第一印象真的不太好。好不容易排到了告訴我房間沒有打掃出來需要等待，我又等了一個小時，如果不是主動催促，還沒有房間，這樣的效率真的太低了。退房也要排隊等待，跟辦理入住的在一個隊伍，確實是很少見。

到了晚上，網絡根本連不上，打了前台電話説讓重啟手機，沒用。先後又派了兩個工作人員來，也無果。給的結論是今天入住的客人太多了，很多客人也反應了，但是相關人員也下班瞭解決不了。作為這麼大的酒店，還承接過重要會議，最基本的網絡供應都保障不了，真的很讓人無語，還不如一個連鎖商務酒店的網絡。

酒店的裝修設施很精緻，但是根本不隔音。樓道里走過的人説話聽的一清二楚，從六點多早餐開始就有人走動，一直到十點多，根本沒辦法好好休息。房間的其他設施，開關、電源，設定的也很不人性化。開關一鍵都開要不就都關。電源很少。棉棒刮鬍刀這些都不提供，還需要靠打電話要，感覺這不應該是這個檔次的酒店應該出現的。

儘管這些問題就算不改進依舊還會有很多人來入住，説出來也是覺得如果改進了會給顧客帶來更好的體驗感。


設施：一般，不人性化，人多沒網
環境：沒的説，地理優勢，依山傍水
服務：一般，辦理入住效率太低，網絡問題就一個解決不了就搪塞了。

優點：獨享小島環境優美，維護的很好。客人密度低，遊玩用餐不是很擁擠。硬件設施可以，空間大，服務比預想的好一些。
缺點：衞生打掃不到位，房間灰塵很大。酒店沒有一點親子元素，細節完全沒有考慮過孩子，小童遊樂場簡陋。早餐供應鏈有問題，經常發生空盤，沒杯子的情況。還有好多細節問題不列舉了。
總體來説是個很有特色的酒店，價格還算是值得，但是帶孩子來度假不是很適合。

房間&服務：挺乾淨的，景觀也不錯。服務也挺好，沒有點評差評裏説的那麼差。推薦島上住一兩晚。
餐飲：早晨自助餐出品，不會讓我大吐槽，也不用期望過高，總體符合水準。
其他娛樂：轉轉會場和塔，用心用料足夠震撼。夜晚清晨推薦户外溜達溜達。

msg:春節期間一家人去過節的，雁棲酒店給我們留下了美好的回憶，特別感謝工作人員June，柳中業的暖心幫助，本來已經錯過了寫春聯的時間，最後她們還積極給孩子安排了。還有禮賓部李生友，熱情和耐心，一到酒店就幫助我們拿行李，辦理入住時還不忘等着我們，直到把行李送房間才離開。餐飲的Gigi，Care也熱情周到，讓人印象深刻，總體感覺所到之處的服務都非常到位，可看出酒店老總比較注重員工培訓的，是值得推薦的好酒店！

首輪客房迷你吧:誠意滿滿，任君挑選，滿足不同人羣的需求，果汁、啤酒、氣泡水種類豐富。

北京雁棲酒店小童樂園:對小朋友十分友好，寒冬臘月在室內玩耍再合適不過。

前台小趙工作細緻，大堂經理體貼入微。

晚餐自助300一位，味道可以但是食物種類不多，有凱賓斯基招牌黑森林蛋糕
早餐自助也很不錯，但是高峯期人不少，需要等位子
房間面積大，孩子可以跑來跑去，建議住在主樓因為餐廳，泳池，小童樂園都在主樓
園區面積大，可以租自行車騎着玩
提個建議擺渡車不能隨意乘坐差點兒意思，園區面積大住客確實該有乘坐擺渡車的權利
還有酒店工作人員態度偏冷淡，有點兒老國企的意思

二個細節，1早餐人多，直接分段用餐，感覺比較舒適。2下午茶比預計的人多了很多，還是無法按期享用，他們自動延長時限並電話通知我們，算是服務補償到位。
人流多，服務人員很耐心，態度都很和善。

Ps評價少了一顆星，是因為入住房間後，發現床上有一根黑長直的頭髮。

但是，西餐廳自助餐服務員、大堂吧下午茶服務員、包括前台辦理入住和退房的服務員等服務意識和服務態度水平真的不符合這家五星級酒店的水準啊，説的誇張點真不如很多四星級服務員的水準，答非所問，表情木納是普遍現象。酒店管理者真該反思一下，歸根結底這是管理的問題，比如可以通過培訓提升整體服務和業務水平，至少待人接物得符合五星級的水準。

🚗 交通：適合自駕，但是離懷柔北站也不遠，還有雁棲站，北京坐高鐵過去也方便
吃飯#我們選了自助早餐，這個早餐的性價比，個人覺得不值得，味道中規中矩，吃飯的人多，管理混亂
定的別墅，給升級為了笨熊親子房，娃很高興，房間很大，泡澡🛀很爽
2號得月居親子房，孩子玩的遊樂設施比較少，住的當天沒什麼人，基本包場
泳池不大，4個泳道，因為娃不舒服，沒去成
我們入住的時候服務都還是很不錯的
好多地方沒去轉，就匆忙進城了，有點遺憾，下次還會去，但是會選冬季或者秋季

入住日下午一點多到店，等了大約一個小時才有房間，我想可能是因為大部分客人離店時間推遲的緣故，可以理解。房間設施比上次入住老舊了，房間裏有淡淡的木頭味道，敏感體質～房間裏浴巾上有個眉毛？不知道，反正看見直接把毛巾扔地上了，其他毛巾還好。床沒問題，枕頭不太舒服。下午茶，賣相很好，但好吃的不多，坦白説有點失水準。畢竟市裡凱賓斯基的麪點可是很著名的……游泳池很好，全時段有工作人員，點贊，而且可以給救生圈充氣，比自己人工吹省力！餐廳：西餐廳的晚餐自助沒有了，有點遺憾，或許因為疫情。除了早餐的自助外，西餐廳變得有點雞肋了。午餐晚餐都是那幾款，其他菜單上列了也沒有～所以晚餐衹能選中餐廳，菜品很多樣，每道菜裝飾都很特別，味道非常好！孩子吃的不停嘴，贊。美中不足就是量太小，一個大人一個孩子吃了七道菜發現沒特別飽，價格700元，真心不便宜。
酒店總體來説環境真的很好。幾年來户外依然到處都修繕的很好，甚至綠化更好了。帶孩子的家庭挺多的，但泳池裡不擁擠，基本去了兩次都衹有最多七八個人，而且都是玩一會就走了，水温27度。中午時段沒人，感覺包場了。以上內容希望對大家有幫助吧。

雁棲酒店，2021年11月5號，我們一行8人入住酒店，一進酒店院裏的路途中發現景色很美，於是下車拍照，到酒店大堂才發現羊絨大衣落在了拍照的地方，回去尋找未果，於是找到了大堂經理shirley女士，她馬上聯繫安保部，並安慰我們應該可以找到的，她看見我的朋友沒有外罩就説你們回房間等候，找到之後給你送到房間，讓我們很感動，過了一段時間大衣找回來了。可笑的事兒是我們的行李箱又忘在了大堂，而我們自己卻不知道，又是shirley女生再次聯繫了我們，讓我們特別感動，為此特提出表揚，表揚這種熱情、認真負責的工作態度，表揚這種文化素養，表揚這種高尚品德並向她學習。
此致
    敬禮！

這次帶着公婆和爸媽去度假，長者都是八十上下的人，我父親腿還不好，一點就辦理完入住手續，説因為沒打掃完，衹給了三間房的一張房卡，期間交涉三次，前台在下午兩點多承諾儘快打掃把房卡送到五號別墅，結果等到三點四十多也沒有開出房卡，四個加起來300歲的長者都沒有得到很好的午休休息，擠在一間房裡等待，雖然經過交涉，值班經理也給予了送果盤升級一間房等補救措施，五號別墅的管家也儘量給予我們熱情的服務，但最初的體驗實在太糟糕了，酒店整體服務細節非常粗糙，包括中餐廳的服務，也就是個農家院的服務水平，食物還並不可口，這還是非週末非節假日的人並不多的背景下，針對疫情防控：酒店對客人也不要求戴口罩。總之槽點一大堆，自己不會去了，也不會推薦朋友去

次日早，我們坐着觀光車繼續欣賞院內美景，併入內參觀了Apec會議中心，合照留影。中午退房後，又在酒店免費品嚐了可口的下午茶，才戀戀不捨的離開了雁棲酒店。

優點是中餐廳很好吃！
