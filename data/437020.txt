The breakfast buffet was delicious with lots of options for a Western or Asian breakfast. 

A large sized room with a grand view of the lake and mountain from the balcony, even from inside the room.
A walk trail along the lake hillside allows you leasure exercise.

The place is huge as a resort with different restaurants, hot spring, and many activities. There are other hotels but I believe this one is the best among them. Coco from the reception speaks perfect English and guided us to the room. Kevin is also very helpful he took me to the Japanese restaurant to check the menu, and made sure I had a comfortable stay. Honestly great service.

She smiles every day and makes people feel like spring breeze, which makes the trip icing on the cake. Zheng Meijuan is also very thoughtful. She delivers water and fruit. When it rains, she also finds a way to give us two umbrellas for us to go out. The brother at the door of the hot spring area thinks about everything for the guests. When he has time, he is busy cleaning up the fallen leaves in the pool. He is handsome and diligent. The uncles on the mountain are also very friendly. When they see guests with children, they guide them to the spring pool suitable for children. When it is cold, they also help to change dry bath towels. In short, it gives me a special feeling as a vacationer. I believe that the hotel is so prosperous because of the efforts of these people! Thank you! To be honest, this hotel is really hardware-powerful and software-powerful. When I want to relax in the future, this must be my first choice!

The resort is very well equipped, the hot spring environment is very good, you can see the lake, and it is the best hot spring with the best view. There are also many pools. There is also a children's farm, which is suitable for children to play. The observation deck overlooks Tianmu Lake. You don't have to go to the lake specifically to play. It's good to enjoy the scenery from the observation deck.

The facilities in the hotel are also good, with various configurations. The breakfast is also very rich, with a full range of styles and very delicious. The Chinese restaurant is also good, very delicious and exquisite, with high quality.

The hotel also has sufficient charging piles, so driving a tram is not a problem at all.

It's outrageous~ I just discovered a resort so close to home. I didn't know where to take my kids on Children's Day, so I decided to come here on a whim so I only stayed for one night. The overall stay experience was excellent. When I opened the window, I saw green and lake views. The scenery was excellent. The restaurant is built by the lake. It is very comfortable to sit in the restaurant while eating breakfast and enjoying the scenery!

The overall feeling of the hotel is natural aesthetics and comfortable sensory experience, which makes this mountain luxury trip simple, return to innocence, and embrace nature!

The scenery is also beautiful, especially the Genting platform. It is super photogenic. Thanks to the travel photographer Xiao Fan for taking beautiful photos of the family. 
The afternoon tea included in the package is quite large. The brown alpaca George is a bit fierce. You can't get too close except for feeding him food. The white alpaca Peppa is more docile. You can touch the fur on the back. If you touch the head, he will spit at you. 
There are really many mosquitoes in the bubble hot spring on this day. Come when it's cold next time.

Although the time had passed, we were still arranged with tools to experience it. We were also given some fresh bamboo shoots when we left. The hot spring room is right outside the outdoor hot spring, which is very convenient for hot springs. There is also a hot spring pool in the room. There are also many activities in the May Day resort, which is satisfactory for both adults and children.

I originally booked a mountain view room, but it was upgraded to a lake view room. The scenery outside the balcony is very good, beautiful both day and night. There are also alpacas and cat houses in the resort area to play with, so you won't be bored even if you don't go out for vacation. A hot spring bath in the middle of the mountain is also very refreshing, and I slept very well after the bath. In addition, I have to praise Aunt Liu Xiuzhen by name. She gave me a fruit plate and a check-in gift on the day of check-in, and a check-out gift bag on check-out. If there is any problem, she can solve it perfectly. Finally, she helped us with the luggage when we left. It's really great. I will come again next time~

The account manager Mr. Wang Jie contacted us in advance and asked us what requirements we had for the hotel, and tried to meet them. He also informed us of the tourist attractions around the hotel, assisted us in checking in, and personally sent us to the room. He was very responsive, thank you very much! Also, the hotel was just doing maintenance on the air conditioning system this time, and there was only ventilation in the room, and we felt a little hot. At this time, the housekeeper Xie Sanmei quickly sent the air cooler, which made us feel very warm! We will come to Hantian again.

The rooms had their own balconies, were clean and spacious, and the high-quality bedding, complete bathroom facilities, and matching toiletries made me very satisfied. Except that the bathtub was not very suitable next to the bed, the hot springs were really good, with more than 40 pools and good water quality. Zeng Chongli and Chen Judi were enthusiastic in service. The gym was well-equipped and had advanced equipment to meet daily needs. The hotel also provides a variety of leisure and entertainment facilities, such as chess and card rooms, billiard rooms, bars, etc., which are not boring at all. The service quality here is also first-class, which left a deep impression on me. Special praise for the outstanding performance of Manager Wang Jie and Housekeeper Ren Huizhen. They both made us feel very kind and warm from the phone greetings before check-in to timely solving various problems for us during the stay. I will still choose Hantian when I come to Tianmu Lake next time!

msg:Regarding the hotel, let me first talk about the dissatisfaction: the first is the bed. The mattress is too soft, and maybe it has been used for too long. The middle has collapsed. When people lie on it, it sinks in, and it has no support for the spine. , I didn‚Äôt sleep well for two nights. When I woke up on the second night, my back hurt. The material of the quilt cover and sheets was very hard, and it made a squeaking sound when I turned over! Second, the air conditioner was so noisy that I turned it off in the middle of the night, but luckily it wasn‚Äôt too cold. Third, there was white paint on each socket, and there was a lot of white paint on the black furniture. It felt very bad. Fourth, the balcony The air leakage at the bottom of the glass door is a bit serious! The curtains were blown up~
The overall service at the hotel is great. The front desk upgraded us to a superior mountain view room. The bellman helped us with our luggage and told us the floor distribution (this is very important for people who stay here for the first time). Housekeeper Liu Xiuzhen's service is very warm and attentive. The children really like the small gifts she gives! The shuttle bus is super convenient, and the service attitude of the drivers and ladies is also very good. The security guards are also great~
The breakfast is very rich and the dining environment is very comfortable. The waiters in the restaurant are also very considerate. Seeing that the children like to eat Skittles, they gave him a pack directly~
The prices of souvenirs in the selection store are okay, but the prices of toys are a bit exaggerated, more than three times the price~
In terms of scenic facilities, the outdoor children's playground is under maintenance and is not open, which is a bit regretful. The Yunding Observation Deck has a wide view. It is very relaxing to listen to the chirping of birds and bask in the sun. The waiters do not stare at the guests and insist on spending, which is very good.
The mid-level hot spring included in the package is worth visiting. There are more than 30 pools. The bath towel station is conveniently set up. You can change it at any time when it gets wet. Hot tea is provided. The staff will remind you of the precautions for soaking in the hot spring and help lay out your shoes. There is also a children's fun pool. The little brother also introduced the Banshan Hot Spring, which is very good! If you want to have a bird's eye view of the lake, you can go to the upper pool, which is crowded. If you want to be quiet, you can choose the lower pool, which is private. The price of the paid items is okay. (The indoor pulse pool has many white whisker-like objects)
Guests staying at the hotel can use their room card to experience the cat pavilion next door on the commercial street. There are two alpacas on the small farm next to the road, some rabbits, squirrels, chickens, and geese. You can feed them a carrot for 20 yuan. There is also a small sand pit and a small tricycle, which is very suitable for children to play! In the cat pavilion, people who are sensitive to odors must wear masks. When I entered without a mask at first, I almost vomited... I put on a mask before feeding the cats with the children. Cat food is priced at NT$10 and NT$38. We I bought it for 48 yuan, and the children were very happy to feed it. The cats are relatively docile and very cute. The waiter will always remind you of some precautions, which is quite good. The entire commercial street environment is still very pleasant when there are few people.
We also played off-road vehicles. The person sitting at the front desk without wearing work clothes seemed to be the person in charge. We were a little skeptical. When buying tickets, we asked her if there was any discount for hotel guests? She said no, they are not the same family! But then we went back to the hotel to inquire and they were told there was a discount! In addition, you have to buy insurance separately, which costs 10 yuan per person. The helmet is very dirty and full of mud. When buying the ticket, they emphasized that the poncho will fully cover it, but in the end, the face, cuffs, and collar were covered with mud, and it still couldn't be covered. !
It is not recommended to go to a farmhouse outside the resort. I found a local restaurant with a high rating. The taste is average. The key is to eat the egg shells in the fried bacon with winter bamboo shoots! Yue! And the price is not cheap, it‚Äôs better to eat at the resort~

msg:This time I booked a hot spring area accommodation. I was attracted by the unlimited hot springs. I stayed for one night and actually went twice. Because it rained heavily during the day, the water temperature of the hot spring was not comfortable enough, and the experience was not good. I went again after the rain stopped at five o'clock, and it was not bad. The guest room is on the third floor. You can go out to the outdoor hot spring, or take the elevator to the first floor to soak in the indoor hot spring, and you can also sweat steam. However, when I went there, the hot spring with massage function on the first floor was broken a lot, and there were not many that could be used.
The bathroom of the guest room has a shower room and a super spacious bathtub. You can see the mountain view while taking a bath in it. It's beautiful. The view of the guest room is very good. The big bed faces the mountain view and pond at the entrance of the hotel. There are swans, fat ducks and many koi, which is very comfortable.
When checking in, I asked if I could check out late. The front desk agreed to delay it for free until 2 pm (actually we checked out at 12:30, because the hot spring was not open until 1 pm, and I felt that there was not enough time, so I left)
The room is very clean. The service is also very attentive and thoughtful. There are free coffee drinks on the third floor. Tea and fruit plates are given when you check in, and Tremella soup is also given in the evening. There is a refrigerator in the room. In addition to free mineral water, there are also cola, etc. There are also paid snacks such as chocolate cakes.
It is very convenient to stay in the hot spring area and soak in the hot springs. You need to go to the main building to check in and eat the buffet breakfast. It is best to park in Parking Lot No. 4 if you drive there. It is closest to the hot spring area. The hotel has free battery cars for pick-up.
Talk about the regrets. The hotel has not yet turned on the air conditioner. It is stuffy with the doors and windows closed, so we had to sleep with the windows open. However, the temperature difference in the mountains is large. It is cold without a quilt at night, and the quilt is too thick, so I sweat a lot all night.
The pillow is of poor quality, soft and slumped, without any resilience, and I didn't sleep well all night. Some facilities in the room are aging, the shower head in the bathtub cannot be used, and the TV and phone are broken and cannot be turned on.
Of course, the flaws do not cover the merits. In Liyang, enjoying a hot spring vacation, Hantian is still the well-deserved first choice.

From the moment I entered the gate of Hantian, the whole environment was neat and orderly, and I felt the vitality among the green trees. When I came to the main building, I could feel the care and attitude of each service staff. The young lady who drove the shuttle bus could enthusiastically send us the hotel activity schedule. Although it was a hotel more than ten years ago, it can be seen that a lot of effort has been put into maintenance. There are many things to do in the hotel. In view of the crowded attractions during the Qingming Festival, I decisively chose to soak in the hotel and dine in the lake and mountains of the hotel's Chinese restaurant. It was very pleasant to soak in the hot spring after dinner. Here I would like to thank Dong Qinghan, the manager of the front office depar**ent, for making many reasonable and thoughtful arrangements for us in two days, which brought a successful end to the vacation trip. Finally, I would like to praise the hotel's breakfast, which is rich in variety and tastes good. It is a rare excellent buffet breakfast in recent years!

The only regret of this trip is: I went for hotel activities during holidays, and found that most of them either had quota restrictions or charged. And I didn't find a children's club. The only few that were free of charge had to buy hot spring tickets to participate.

In the past two years, I have stayed in Xiamen Haiyue, Dong'ao Island Gree, and Haitang Bay Grand Hyatt during holidays, and I haven't met children who have no activities to play and ask for leave.

The scale and sense of space of this hotel are good. The hotel room has a bathtub, a shower, a separate cloakroom, and a separate bathroom. The family room has three beds, two 1.5 and one 1.2. It would be better if there was a room with a 1.8-meter bed. The scale is so wide, why not a little bigger? The family with two children thinks this is not reasonable.
The restaurant must be praised. Although the family was given three breakfast coupons and there was a queue for breakfast in the morning, the waiter's service was really detailed. The dishes are also very rich. There are six or seven kinds of drinks. The Chinese content also includes Hu La Tang, Rou Jia Mo, and duck blood vermicelli soup, which is a specialty of Nanjing. I won't explain the others one by one. Although it is breakfast, it is basically brunch.
The entrance of the hotel is Tianmu Lake, which is a substitute for Qiandao Lake. If you live here, you should set aside time to walk around. It is very pleasant.
If you have to say the shortcomings, it is that the surrounding catering is average. The nearby businesses basically do group meals, three black and three white, and there are no richer restaurants. Of course, this is not the hotel's problem.

We bought a room voucher for 850 yuan for two nights including breakfast. We thought that the room and service corresponding to this price would be the same, but the result was unexpectedly good!
I added the housekeeper's WeChat account in advance and mentioned that we were two adults and two children, and we hoped to upgrade the room type. We were happily upgraded to a Lego family room with three beds (see Figure 16). When we got to the room, our hairstyle was too gloomy, and It had been raining the week we came, and the room was dark and cramped, so we contacted the front desk to see if we could upgrade to a lake view room. We looked at the lake view rooms and found that all the twin and queen beds were not suitable for us. The housekeeper, Chen Mei, asked about the room via WeChat. I answered truthfully, so I upgraded us to a suite. Although it didn't face the lake, the floors were from the 2nd to the 8th floor, and there were two rooms, which made it much more spacious.
In addition, I have been asking if there are any other needs. Fruit plates are delivered every day and hot milk is delivered every night (this is extra because the children drink milk every night before going to bed). Drinks are also provided every day and are returned when leaving. Carrying a bag of drinks was very considerate!
The western part of the hotel's breakfast is average, but the Chinese part is great, the large intestine noodles are free, the snacks are also very good, there are too few fruits, and the breakfast room is huge! The scenery is not bad~
The room voucher you bought included two hot spring tickets, and you can buy them on site for 199 each. The pool halfway up the mountain can see the lake and mountains. The scenery is amazing! There are towels and hot tea on the mountain, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about getting cold or thirsty~
Although it rained all the way during this trip, there were very few people there. The experience would be better if there were fewer people. It is a resort that I would like to come back next time~

When we checked in, we knew that we had children, and the housekeeper promptly delivered the children's toiletries and shoes. , bathrobe, Hantian Resort is very big, but you can take the shuttle bus anywhere. You can ask the front desk in each area or Baoan to help you contact the taxi, which is very convenient. The aunt who takes the shuttle bus is also very enthusiastic. Very good attitude. The view from the main building is the best. Along Tianmu Lake, the view restaurant on the 9th floor is also very good, the view is very good, but it is recommended to come during the day, because it will be dark at night and you will not be able to see anything clearly. The hot spring is also adjacent to the lake. It is really nice to enjoy the scenery while taking a bath. In short, it is still recommended for elderly people with children to relax on vacation.

This time I stayed in a lake-view twin room for 3 days and 2 nights. The park is very large, with a commercial street and a hot spring center. , Hong Kong-style food, etc. There are small station wagons to pick up and drop off from the main building to other places in the resort, free of charge. There are many farmhouses near the hotel, very close, about 5-10 minutes by car; the 5A scenic spot Nanshan Bamboo Sea is a little further away. After driving for nearly an hour, we met Fangsuoqian Village on the way. It is a very well-designed village rich in Huizhou architectural style.
My experience during my stay at the hotel: joyful and warm. The day before check-in, the hotel lobby manager will call to confirm the itinerary and help arrange the room. After arriving in the room, the room steward will take the initiative to greet you and understand your needs for the room. Of course, if you don‚Äôt know anything about the resort, you can ask directly. During my stay, I troubled my housekeeper Ms. Zhu Lanfen several times. I would like to express my special thanks to her! In addition, when you go out during the day, you can also ask the housekeeper to make a night bed. Thank you very much to those who work the night shift (Ms. Chen Guojuan, Ms. Zhang Juying

I was upgraded to a mountain view room for free (I didn't get the legendary lake view upgrade). I checked the hotel reviews and was worried that the room would be bad, but it exceeded my expectations. The room was large, the view was beautiful, and the housekeeper was very good. He gave the children a surprise as soon as they arrived. The only downside was that the hotel's children's playground was large but had a few facilities, and the meals in the resort were too expensive. I suggested driving 15 minutes to eat at the farmhouse, which tasted good and was affordable. The hotel breakfast was very rich and the view was beautiful.

It‚Äôs no problem to take a taxi from Liyang Station to the hotel. The next day I went to Nanshan Bamboo Sea. It was really inconvenient to take a taxi from the resort. Later, I asked the front desk to help call a taxi.
The waiters had very good attitudes and were very enthusiastic. I asked for an extra bottle of Coke. When the room service saw that there were children, they even gave me a few extra bottles of drinks.
The hot springs are very comfortable. Although it is cold, the distance between the hot springs is very short. After soaking in the hot spring at the entrance, you can soak in one hot spring after another. Finally, the view from the hot springs on the top of the mountain is very good, and the a**osphere is different during the day and at night.
In the off-season of winter, the hotel applied for a late check-out. On the last day, I went shopping in the resort. Because of the rain, the outdoor feeding of small animals was not open. However, hotel guests can experience cat petting for free, which can be regarded as entertaining for children.

msg:Liyang is a treasure city. I like it very much and will try to come there every year in the future! Hantian has been famous for a long time. The resort hotel and park walks are great. The breakfast and Chinese food are good, but the Western pastries are ordinary and there are few types. Only the mousse is delicious and the egg tarts are very common. I had to eat a few bites in order not to waste. There are all kinds of toppings, but it would be more in line with local characteristics if there are fish soup noodles. Black rice noodles are available in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai. In short, the resort hotel mainly serves breakfast and afternoon tea, and I feel that the food is not outstanding. You must soak in the hot springs. It is recommended to go at night. You can climb mountains during the day and soak in the hot springs at night. You can avoid the sun by looking at the lake. The services and facilities of hot springs in China are similar, and they are the same here, but the night view of the lake is outstanding, which is an extra bonus! Then, I want to blow up the Tianmu Lake fish head, which is 10,000 times more delicious than Qiandao Lake! All the fish heads in Qiandao Lake are crappy and unpalatable. For the same price of 200 yuan, I ate the fish soup twice in Qiandao Lake, which refreshed my understanding of fish head soup. The braised fish nuggets were also tasteless. Liyang is simply heaven in comparison! Every fish soup is delicious. I can only eat the main meal for the two of us. Even though we are full, we are still very happy ~ The layout of the room is backward, but the size, air conditioning, water pressure, and hot water are all very good. If the price is right, I recommend staying there. Suitable for a short trip on weekends~ The service is also very good, and the breakfast closes quickly when there are many people. In addition, if you drive by yourself, you can only park on the side of the road. In fact, I think it is more convenient to take a taxi.

The hotel is high-end and classy, ‚Äã‚Äãwith a beautiful environment and a first-line lake view. Unfortunately, the weather was bad and I couldn't take good photos.
The handsome guy who checked in was friendly and professional. After checking in, the waiter brought a lot of things and the service attitude was quite excellent.
The group purchase was for the lowest-end room. The room was large and had a lake view on the side of the balcony, which far exceeded expectations. The toilet is icy cold, even though we provided a disposable toilet seat, it didn't improve much. In addition, washing supplies are very difficult to use. I strongly recommend changing suppliers. Nowadays, many domestic brands are of high quality and low price.
The breakfast is indeed extremely rich as the reviews say, especially the noodles served in the open stall. The toppings are so delicious that you can achieve the freedom of fatteningüòÄ
The hotel's mid-level hot springs are also great. There are many pools. It feels great to enjoy the lake view while soaking in the hot springs.

We were upgraded to a double bed with a mountain view. Unexpectedly, the bathtub next to the bed refreshed my understanding. It seems that the bathtub location design is not highly used. There is also the meaning of the peeping hole, which I can‚Äôt understand! Bathing privacy is very poor. After struggling for a long time, I proposed to change rooms. Obviously, the design of the room downstairs is much more reasonable. The independent bathroom and washroom are separated, and the privacy is very good. Although the decoration is a bit old, it is well maintained. The chair on the balcony is broken, please replace it!
However, the hardware conditions are a bit lacking and the service is needed to make up for it, which adds a lot of points to the experience! Zhu Lanfen, the building manager on the second floor, has an impressive smile and is very warm and thoughtful!

The hot springs in the hotel are also very clean and the service staff are very caring! It feels good! There is everything to do and eat around. The food in the hotel is also very delicious.

msg:Choosing Hantian Hot Spring in Tianmu Lake for this trip can be said to be the most correct choice. The fatigue from daily work is completely gone.
The package purchased includes a hot spring double room for two (including breakfast for two), a 35-minute shoulder, neck and back spa for two, a fish therapy for two (worth RMB 38), and afternoon tea on the Genting Platform for two. I can‚Äôt say **, but it‚Äôs worth it.

Facilities: Our double bed room is in a hot spring, not in a hotel (breakfast is eaten in the hotel, and there is a shuttle bus back and forth), so you can go in and out of the hot spring repeatedly, and you can take a dip even after checking out.
Although the room facilities such as air conditioning and the like look a bit old-fashioned, there is no problem in using it. The most important thing is that it is very clean. The four-piece set didn't have any odor and the towels were very clean. The pillows are not too high and the mattress is moderately firm. The toothbrush actually has soft bristles.
The most surprising thing is that while many hotels cannot cast screens, you can do so here! Screen! This must be praised.
The only drawback is that the TV is at right angles to the bed and there is no rotating bracket, so you can only watch TV while lying on the bed.

Service: The aunts and staff are very enthusiastic. They always remind us about safety, replenish towels and tea, and help us change our bathrobes. The bathrobes in the room also look cleaner than the public ones. In the evening, my aunt will also give us a midnight snack (tremella soup), which is very heartwarming.
Special praise to Zhang Min and Master Pan Aixiang who picked up and dropped off the sightseeing bus. The service was very patient and would introduce us to restaurants and attractions along the way. We have a lot of luggage and will help, thank you!

The breakfast is rich. I feel that Liyang should be visited in spring or late autumn and early winter, which is more suitable for hot springs. It is good, but it is a bit cold during the Spring Festival. I will come again when I have time. of

msg:The three-day and two-night package I bought from Ctrip a long time ago always showed that it was fully booked. Years ago, I suddenly found that I could make an appoin**ent, so I brought my baby here. The entire resort is very big, with several accommodation areas. It is best to drive there. , although there is a shuttle bus inside, it is not convenient if you want to eat out. We stayed in the main building, and the mountain view room we were given was in a good location and we could still see a little bit of the lake. The scenery was pretty good. You can go to the commercial street to eat in the scenic area. We ate at the fishing pier with good reviews. The taste was average and the price/performance ratio was not very good. So I went directly to Tianmu Lake Town to eat there the next day. The price was cheaper and the taste was better. It was quite comfortable to go to the hot spring on this day, but it was easy to catch a cold on the way from indoor to outdoor. Guests staying in the hotel can bring the bathrobe from the room. The hot spring is not suitable for children, but there is also a pool for children to play in, and there are many people. The water in the infinity swimming pool is at room temperature, so I could only take photos on the edge on this day. The breakfast variety is very rich. Although there are many people dining, the place is large and there are many seats, so the dining experience is okay. Children can play in the cafe next to the road in the commercial street. There is a place to dig sand and you can also see animals. It was a bit dark when we went there at night, and the animals had gone back to rest, so it is suitable to go there during the day. Although the children's playground inside the hotel is large, there is not much to play. For adults' entertainment, there is a KTV and a chess and card room. After experiencing it, I found that this place is not suitable for bringing preschool children here. It is suitable for couples and couples to stay alone. But the advantage is that the package price is cheap, and it is still okay to stay casually.

I booked the Little Yellow Duck parent-child room that my children liked. I went to the front desk and told them that there was hot water in the Little Yellow Duck room. The problem is, I changed it to a big-mouthed monkey theme. My kids still like it very much. I didn‚Äôt go anywhere else to play because I was raising two kids by myself. I just went shopping in the resort. The commercial street is pretty good. There are not many people and it‚Äôs quiet. I I really like this feeling. I stayed here for three nights. My kids loved going to the hot springs. There are hot springs with various themes in the mid-level hot springs. There are shuttle buses for transportation. It‚Äôs really convenient. This hotel is really good. The service staff in all depar**ents are very good, and the overall experience is very good. The security guy Xi Jinhe is very nice. Seeing me as a woman with two children, he asked me to park my car in a temporary parking space in front of the hotel so that I could travel. It's more convenient. I rarely write reviews. This is the first time I've written such a long review. I plan to bring my mother and children to stay here again during the summer vacation.

Since the lake water level is low in winter, we went down to the shallows on the lake shore and encountered river eels, egrets and grebes. The hot springs are relaxing, the animals are cute, and the scenery is beautiful!

Because there were many people coming, I contacted the floor steward in advance to communicate, and I was very satisfied with the service I received. The housekeeper arranged for several families to live in adjacent rooms, upgraded their rooms, and gave them fruit cakes, children's supplies, etc. Therefore, to enjoy good services, you must exercise your subjective initiative, and you cannot expect the world to fall into pieces. I would like to commend Jiang Jiahua at the front desk, Chen Mei and Zhu Lanfen from the housekeepers. During our stay in Hantian, they gave us meticulous care and concern, and truly put themselves in front of customers and served in every detail! In addition to Hantian Resort, the service at Banshan Hot Spring amazed me even more. Because the mother took her six-year-old boy to the hot springs, she could not enter the men's changing room. The hot spring male waiters helped the children change and take off their clothes, bathe and clean up throughout the whole process. The service staff at the mid-level hot springs were also very polite and helped to look after the children. Wearing bath towels; friends who were traveling with us also helped us find things they forgot in the hot spring and contacted us in time; the aunt in the dressing room was even more dedicated and considerate. After taking a bath, she quickly handed me a dry and neat towel so that I could wipe my body clean quickly. It‚Äôs a great place with beautiful scenery and people. I‚Äôll definitely come back next year~

On the other hand, the service management from top to bottom was great. When the manager saw the birthday date, he took the initiative and asked if he wanted to prepare a cake, which was still six inches big! Then the waiter in room 1511 is also great. She will help place the items when tidying up, instead of just tidying up ruthlessly. Made us feel warm.

It is not very user-friendly. Food is limited. There is nothing to do in the commercial street, but the shuttle bus is very convenient. There are three aspects where the experience is poor: 1.

However, you asked them questions for more than half a day and they didn‚Äôt reply. I hope the staff can improve their service awareness; 2.

The child fed the cat and the cat came to grab the food and was bitten. The clerk said it was fine. Parents were worried about taking the rabies vaccine. This feeding ring
We hope that management can be strengthened. We can control the children but not the cats. If you want to be exempted from liability, then don‚Äôt do the feeding process. If you want to be exempted from liability and want to make money, all the good things will be taken away. Just look at it; 3. Adults bought by Hantian Hot Spring Package ticket. The child had just received the rabies vaccine and could not take a bath, so he did not buy it. The clerk still asked and said that after entering, he had to buy a 98 yuan bath ticket. The clerk ignored the explanation and said that children could not play in the lobby and could only go in with adults. You have to buy a ticket to go in, or go out to play, which is too inhumane.

Hantian is actually a big resort, which has standard hotels and single-family villas. It also allows homestay merchants to settle in to meet various travel needs. At the same time, it is equipped with various types of gourmet restaurants, horse farms and alpaca halls, and even go-karts and helicopters. , You can basically stay in it for several days without being bored!
The family room of Hantian was booked very early, and we were going to get out of the busy work during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, and spend a few days with the family. I had expected the high passenger flow during holidays, but when I arrived at the hotel, I was told that the room type we booked was gone [the same room name will have different room types, the one we wanted is gone, it‚Äôs not overbooked! Not oversold! ], I thought there would be some shortcomings in this trip, but Li Erfeng, the manager of the hotel, was very active in helping to coordinate after knowing our needs. In the end, he was pleasantly surprised to help upgrade the room, which instantly eased our low mood Go back to the cloud and set the tone for this Dragon Boat Festival trip with joy! [Why Joy will be discussed later]
After solving the room problem, a shuttle bus came to pick us up to the room. The housekeeper Wang Zhihua [Yes! The upgraded room has a butler~] Fruits are ready and waiting for us. After showing us around the room, let us have a good rest. When we go to the fish pier in the resort for dinner at night, we also told the butler that the shuttle bus will arrive soon. Wait for us! [This is also what I think is great about the service of Hantian, that is, you can show up at any time when you need it, and give you the space when you don‚Äôt need it! „ÄëThe dishes at the fish wharf are also excellent! Shrimp sauce ribs, go eat! trust me!
The breakfast at the hotel the next day was also excellent! There are many types and they are all delicious, and I ate them all. After breakfast, I also benefited from the recommendation of Manager Li. I overlooked the panoramic view of Tianmu Lake in Yunding, and spent a pleasant morning with various small animals in the commercial street! The dishes packed at the Ming stall restaurant at night are also delicious, and the curry beef brisket is really amazing! When I was eating, I found that there was no toothpick, and the housekeeper Wang came to deliver it in the rain. Thank you very much!
It was still a bit rainy on the last day, but Butler Wang helped to delay check-out and sent a souvenir [there is freshly picked corn in it! ], making the mood of a little depressed because of the rain disappear without a trace! After checking out, I went to the coffee shop in the hotel to drink coffee. The whole trip was a perfect end! This time I was really super happy and super at ease, and it also allowed us to have a relatively quiet and happy journey during the holidays with more people! Really, Han Tian is super worth coming back a hundred times! I would also like to thank Li Erfeng, Wang Zhihua, Dai Chunhong and the night shift housekeeper Wang Ximei for their service. I will definitely come to Hantian next time! Bring family and friends together!

The buffet breakfast on the first floor of the hotel is very good, with a variety of categories. On the viewing platform at the top of the mountain, there are indoors and outdoors.

Before leaving, they also prepared slippers and drinks for us, thank you very much!

It is equivalent to adding 300 to buy a single hot spring ticket for two people. If you want to go to the infinity pool with the logo, you must buy a hot spring ticket. Yunding Viewing Platform It's another place. There is afternoon tea, and you can take pictures without compulsory consumption. It seems that the swimming pool can't enter the water.

I feel that there are very few options for eating... Takeaways are almost impossible to deliver. We ate at Hong Kong-style restaurants for two consecutive days.

All the entertainment items are basically in the commercial street. The hotel shuttle bus is very convenient to pick up and drop off at any time. I like the bar very much. The environment of alpacas and cats is average. Equestrianism is not horseback riding. , took about 10 minutes, and finally only gave 5 refined and unoriginal photos.

I originally booked a hot spring room but it wasn‚Äôt in the main building, and I couldn‚Äôt upgrade to the main building.

The corridors of the hotel are very smelly, the facilities are old, the TV, table and bathtub are not provided with disposable bath bags. Considering the overall worrying sanitary conditions, I dare not use them anyway
The concierge service is not in place and the takeaway is not delivered upstairs. No one answered the phone at the front desk, and there is no service attitude. Just say "we don't provide this kind of service." After leaving the store, it is more polite to say that I want to make up for it, but it is thoughtful Doing these things is not as good as doing a good job of serving the customers during their stay in the store
The price of the restaurant is not close to the people and the taste of the ingredients is not very good. The casserole fish head costs more than 400. The fish itself is cheap and the fish is not fresh. fresh firewood
 
I should be regarded as the kind that is more tolerant to food, because I usually live in Shanghai. Many restaurants with a per capita price of less than 200 in Shanghai usually have poor seasoning ingredients. Generally speaking, when I go out to play, I always think that local restaurants are cheap and taste good, or the price, taste, and freshness of ingredients. Rarity can always account for two. .
The price of the fruit plate is 38. Four slices of watermelon, four slices of cantaloupe, and six slices of radish. The watermelon is cut out for a while and is a bit soft. Please take a sip at this price level.

In addition to delivering fruits and desserts every day, as long as there is something that bothers them, they will be very enthusiastic to solve it for us. It can be said to be top service. I would like to thank the two aunts on duty, Zhang Rongfang and Li Youqin. If there are holidays in the future, I will consider Hantian. (The above evaluations are all my experience of this peak-staggered trip. It does not include the tourist peak, and all spectators can make their own decisionsüòÜ)

Hygiene: clean and tidy
Environment: The location is superior, the environment is beautiful, the coffee shop on the top of the mountain has a nice viewüëç
Service: Mr. Qian Weiliang's service is very attentive and thoughtful. He originally wanted to change the room but still felt a little inconvenient, so he stayed in the original room. The hotel provided afternoon tea as a thank you!
I went to the restaurant around 7:30 in the morning. There are many varieties but not exquisite enough. The texture and taste of the dishes are not as good as the Anji Hantian where I lived a week ago. Hope to improve in the future!
Complimentary one glass of cocktail at Bang Bar: No one mentioned this to us since we checked in
[Jurassic Camping] Carnival Activity Area Activities (Dinosaur Egg Ring/Slingshot Shooting/Jungle Frisbee/Sandbag Throwing): This is the same, no one told us, I think the information included in the order package should be check-in At that time, the hotel staff should tell you one by one, based on my previous living experience, but I didn't say it this time! We also forgot to ask!
Overall, the a**osphere of the resort hotel is good. My husband and I both said that we come to the hot springs in autumn and winter. There is also a small problem to make a suggestion to the hotel. When we left, we saw a church with a flower field, so we parked the car in the small road ahead, walked over and took a few photos, but there were a few missing bricks on the slightly sloping road. It turned into small pits, as shown in Figure 1. I sprained my feet here. The pits may not be a big deal for men with big feet, but they are quite dangerous for those with smaller feet or children. I just waited on the side of the road for my husband to get a car and come around to pick me up. During the few minutes I was waiting, an empty hotel shuttle bus drove past me, and I didn‚Äôt even ask if I wanted to use it or not. The car drove past at a fast speed. Damn, this is a place in the resort area. Aren't all the guests who can stand in this position are hotel guests! Hope the hotel can pay attention to this!

The staff are also very warm and polite. We booked a hot spring double room , the feature is that you can enter and exit the Banshan Hot Spring unlimited times!
After registering in the main building, the young lady at the front desk kindly sent us an electronic map and guide, very caring! As for the guest room, the room is clean and tidy, and everything is well prepared. The staff introduced it very well. Fruits and refreshments were delivered as soon as we checked in. In the evening, there was white fungus soup and fruit, all of which were delicious and fresh! Wu Fen, Zhang Ronghua, and You Tianhui are very good at providing services. They will enthusiastically provide the help we need, and ask us if we need wake-up service and if we can clean the room. After going out for a day and returning to the hotel, the room is tidy. And there are warm white fungus soup and sweet fruits. I am very grateful to the aunts for their care~
Regarding the hot springs, the overall style of the Banshan Hot Springs is relatively respectful of nature. My favorite is the pool where you can see the lake. Looking at the scenery, soaking in hot springs, eating fruits and drinking tea, I am very grateful to Zhang Liujihe The two staff members, Peng Yuqin, replaced dry towels for us in a timely manner, prepared tea, gave directions, bought snacks and delivered them to the side, and prepared new bathrobes for us to go ashore to eat. The service is very good! This time, the infinity pool is the biggest nostalgia for me. The infinity pool is really very beautiful. The first time we went there was at night, and it was not very shocking. The lifeguard Qian Chunya is really professional, and the service is very timely. Tea The towels are ready before we go ashore, and they will correct our incorrect swimming movements. If you want to learn how to swim, you can ask him to guide you haha, and he will enthusiastically tell us that the scenery during the day is beautiful. I went there once, it's really, really beautiful~
The hotel staff is also very good. Due to the large number of trips, I didn't seriously experience the Banshan hot springs in the first two days. I told the staff when I checked out and then changed our hands to go to the hot springs. I am very grateful to everyone I met. Help from the staff! This experience made us all linger and forget to return, and we are ready to come back again when we have time. The service of the staff in the whole resort is very good!

Overall, the experience is good. I will travel to the resort again if I have the opportunity to travel next time. The baby likes the mini farm and hot spring here very much.

The trails by the lake make people linger and forget to return. You can spend a whole afternoon in a daze. Compared with the crowded tourist attractions, I don‚Äôt know where it is.
The hot springs in the middle of the mountain are amazing. It is said that there are as many as 20 or 30 open-air hot spring pools. Anyway, I didn't have time to soak them all. The best thing is that you can enjoy the beautiful scenery of Tianmu Lake while soaking in the hot springs. Just playing in a few lake-view pools is enough.
The hotel service is very attentive, and every staff member encountered is polite and enthusiastic. The lobby manager, Xiao Li, took the initiative to contact and introduce the hotel's facilities and entertainment items before check-in, and also helped upgrade the lake-view room. During the stay, I felt that the room was a bit stuffy (the central air conditioner was not cooled yet), and the air cooler was sent in time. In terms of service, it can be said that I am very satisfied.
The hotel should have been built for some years, but the hardware facilities do not feel outdated (maybe it has been renovated?), and it also has a sense of class. Some floors were still under renovation this time, but it didn't affect the experience of staying.
The food and beverage experience is average, the price is expensive as expected and the level is only satisfactory, not particularly amazing.
It's a pity that the weather was bad this time, and I didn't go to many of the entertainment items introduced. The main thing was to soak in the hot spring once and take a walk around when it wasn't raining, but I already felt that it was worth the fare.

The view facing the room is quite amazing, you can lie comfortably for an afternoon. It is highly recommended to go to the Yunding Observation Deck not far away, I really like it. (The hotel has a sightseeing car to take it there) Next time if I have a chance, I want to experience the room that is currently being renovated and the Hantian Yangxin Valley not far away.

msg:I haven't been out of the province for 3 years, and because I haven't had a day off for 3 years of work, I can't help but reward and comfort myself and my family when it opens. This trip with my parents to the hot springs was very lucky. I originally booked a suite at the Hantian Resort Hotel. After arriving, I was told that the room had been upgraded to a single-family villa in Yangxin Valley. Since the experience far exceeded expectations, I had to write a good review this time. ~ I also thank the hotel for letting me relax this time and give me a good start for 23 years~~~ I will look for the Hantian signboard when I go to other places in the future~
p.s. not childcare not childcare not childcare

Facilities: The entire hilltop is within the scope of the resort, and there are several hotels in it. There are mid-to-high-end hotels that should meet the needs of all kinds of people~Yangxin Valley should belong to the high-end level, butler-style service, and the car can be used from the moment it arrives at the hotel registration office. Moved, the young lady will patiently introduce the hotel situation when checking in, and answer any questions one by one super professionally, all the luggage outside has been put on the shuttle bus, and the people are sent directly to the door of the villa. The butler is already waiting in the room, introducing Various facilities and switches, rooms and floor heating are really considerate~ From now on, you can play in the resort as long as you bring your mobile phone, and the shuttle bus is on call. If you want to wash your lungs, you can go for a walk before you get tired~
The Ctrip package includes hot spring tickets. There are dozens of hot spring pools in the whole hot spring hall. When we went in the afternoon, there were not many people. ‚óá„Éª) ha ha ha) ~
The breakfasts of several hotels are all in one place. Breakfast time may be the time when you can see the most people in a day. The resort is so big that you can‚Äôt see many people wherever you go~ Finally, you can get rid of the crowds of big cities for a short time Very good


Hygiene: five stars. I was afraid that the bathtub in the hotel was not clean and wanted to take a bath, so I brought a disinfectant towel. I wiped the wet towel as shown in the picture and it was really clean. After wiping the whole bathtub, the towel was still very white without any discoloration. This was a pleasant surprise. . The linens in the room and the tablecloths in the restaurant are all white without any stains. No matter what method you use to clean them, the store is really careful. Speaking of hot spring pools, basically there is a circle of plants around each pool, but there is not a single leaf in the pool. It should be either the design is good or the staff are diligent. Anyway, I feel that the pool is clean and very good~


Service: After experiencing the itinerary for three days and two nights, I feel that the hardware and software services of the entire resort are in place. Whether it is the arrival speed of the shuttle bus or the diligence of the cleaning lady, welcome fruit snacks are arranged every day, and the next day's cleaning That's right, when we went to have breakfast, we rushed to clean it up, and after eating, everything was restored to its original state, and a whole set of toiletries and drinks were generously replenished. Although these costs are not large, it feels really comfortable, no What is lacking in the search, what is missing, what is really a**ospheric


Environment: Everything is green as far as the eye can see. It is still winter. I feel that the flowering season should be more beautiful. The lung washing and eye protection are all in place. If you want to climb high, there is a viewing platform to walk a little bit. It is very suitable for climbing without going too high. For the middle-aged and elderly people who climbed the mountain, we couldn't see the mountains and lakes clearly when we went up this day, but we could fully imagine the beautiful scenery when the weather was good. My scalp tingles when I see so many people. It can be said that all the advantages of this resort are on my heart. I am so happy.

I talked about a lot of trivial things, but I didn‚Äôt fully express all my feelings. Generally speaking, it‚Äôs really a good choice for families who want to enjoy themselves + soak up the soup. Although Yangxin Valley is expensive, there is a reason why it is expensive. To be honest, the shortcoming of the entire resort may be the catering aspect of the local characteristic fishing pier restaurants in the village. When you come to the local area, you always have to eat some local specialties. The dishes are useless, but the plates seem to be cold. It is warm, including cooking, which lacks a breath of heat, and there are really no shortcomings.

Recommended index: five stars
Will recommend index: five stars
Second brush possibility: five stars
Satisfaction: five stars
Relaxation level: five stars


What a happy journey! ~~~~

msg:Our one-year-old and one-year-old Hampton Resort experience from 14:30 on March 24 to 12:00 on March 25:
stay:
I originally booked a hot spring room because I can go back and forth to the Mid-mountain hot springs for free and unlimited times during the stay, but when I arrived at the main building, I found that the scenery of the main building would make the decoration better. I temporarily asked the front desk to change to the main building. The beauty who checked in (forgot her name) was very helpful. Upgraded the lake view room, the room is big, clean and hygienic, and a piece of fruit was also given.
Serve:
After entering the room, the floor attendant Gao Jianfang took the initiative to send children's toiletries and slippers for the baby. The details are in place. I added the company WeChat and sent me a guide to the resort. I will remind you not to miss it at breakfast time. I sent another bag of water and beverages for drinking on the way back, which was very considerate. The hotel's shuttle bus is also very convenient. We have taken it many times to go to hot springs, shopping malls, amu*****t parks, and call the front desk at any time to arrange a free shuttle bus, which is great.
play:
On the afternoon of the first day, I took the children to the cat house to pet the cats. The cats are very cute and not afraid of people, but the cat house needs to be deodorized frequently, otherwise it will not be long. Later, I went to Banshan Hot Springs. There are many hot spring pools, and it is impossible to soak all the pools in two hours. The next morning, I went to Shan Hai Jing Paradise. Eldest sisters Xu Qunying and Wu Qinfen from the park were very enthusiastic. They made balloons for the children and made bubble water for the children to play with. They spent 20 yuan to buy a large portion of carrots. After feeding the alpacas, I was lucky to see the peacocks in the park spread their tails.
FOOD:
The hotel's breakfast is very rich, which is the standard of a five-star resort hotel, and the taste is not bad, but the quality and variety of fruits need to be improved.
Opinion:
So far, the resort has given me a good impression, but when I was leaving, I took two of my children to eat the highly rated local stove. We bought a package of 198 in the mini program, and finally left At that time, they charged us 2 yuan per person for tableware, which is not much money, but as we all know, it is unreasonable and illegal. I originally wanted to complain. Forget it, please pay attention to this trivial matter. The set meal can be sold for 202 , no one will mind, but it is disgusting to charge extra for cutlery.

The pools on the top of the mountain can soak in hot springs and enjoy Tianmu Lake without delay. There are red wine pools and milk pools, but the Chinese medicine pool is my favorite. , there are not many people at night, so you can enjoy it alone~ If you don‚Äôt want to go to the open air, there is also a pool in the room where you can make private soup. It is served until ten o'clock. After breakfast, you can go to the hydrophilic platform, which is integrated with Tianmu Lake. There is also a path up the mountain to Yunding Platform, which is the best photo spot.
After three days and two nights, I was reluctant to leave the resort, and I will go next time!

msg:The overall environment of the hotel is very good. The resort is very large and divided into many hotels. In addition to hot springs, there are shops, amu*****t parks and other entertainment projects. Shuttle buses between regions are very convenient and timely. The resort hotel we chose has very good services in all aspects. The two housekeepers, Zhang Juying and Aunt Han Jianfang, are even more warm, thoughtful and very dedicated.
The hotel facilities are complete, a little regret, it is not difficult to see that the resort has a lot of passengers, and the internal facilities of the rooms are a little old. The lake view room does not see a large area of the lake. It was only later that I realized that now that the water level has dropped, the original area of the lake has been greatly reduced, and more than half of the area within sight has become the foreshore. This is a little impatient.
Because I lived in Anji Hantian before, there is a comparison. The area of the resort is much larger, not as good as Anjixin, but its carrying capacity is huge. Especially the restaurant, it is simply not too big, not too worthwhile. Originally, with Anji Hantian's experience, I didn't report much hope for breakfast. I didn't expect the biggest highlight of the whole process to be here. For a foodie like me, it is even more attractive than hot springs. . . Because the old people were tired after coming down from Zhuhai, we did not go to Yushui Hot Spring, but came to the resort‚Äôs own Banshan Hot Spring, which also brought an excellent experience to one of the main purposes of this trip. After soaking in the hot spring, the body and mind are relaxed. It can only be cloudy and foggy at night, not accompanied by a beautiful lake view. But the trip was complete and comfortable. Thank you very much for the drinks, fruits and small gifts prepared by the butler before we left.

Service: I experienced an exclusive butler service at the Peninsula Villa.
The butler Dai Chunhong and the night butler Wang Ximei were proactive and considerate in their service. They made local white tea for us as soon as we arrived, introduced us to the room facilities and the services of the resort, and prepared snacks and water for us before we left.

It is especially suitable for children and children, and it is suitable for a family. There are battery cars to pick you up from the guest room to the restaurant and the hot spring, but we prefer to walk and walk around.
There are more people in the hot springs on weekends, especially in the pools facing Tianmu Lake. There is a lounge and a Hong Kong-style restaurant on the upper floor of the hot spring. The French Teppanyaki has been fully booked and it is a pity that I did not experience it.
Breakfast: The hotel's breakfast variety is particularly rich, and the restaurant is very large. It is not cramped because of the crowds on weekends. Outside is the lawn and Tianmu Lake. Fortunately, I did not miss such a good breakfast because of being lazy.

You must take your family to experience it. There are really many soup pools. You can find out which pools are there by just swiping (I‚Äôm a little lazy) Homework) and you can see the lake and mountains, but I think it would be perfect to have some snow in winter üòè I like the fish therapy pool the most, it‚Äôs really super cool! The only thing that is not ideal is that the water in the pool is a bit dirty, maybe too many people have been received, we were given two hot spring tickets in the room, which is very good!

The Lego building room we ordered is really big and spacious, but it is a bit hot. I feel that I can‚Äôt wear a sweater in the room. The air conditioner is too powerful.
There are also commercial streets in the resort, children's playgrounds, small animals, and unique cafes. You can basically spend a day here!

Finally, I would like to thank our welcome brother Zhu Qi, who is very considerate in his service, and you can find him to solve any problems, thank you for your hard work! During the Chinese New Year, I still stick to my post and provide high-quality services to the guests. I feel that every staff member here is very enthusiastic and left me with a good experience!
There are also many shuttle bus staff who are mostly young ladies. As long as the guests need to pick up and drop off, the scheduling is really flexible. Special thanks to the security guard Shi Xuemei, who helped us carry our luggage to the garage. Hantian, next time Come again!

      Except for the No. 1 parking lot in the resort building, the other 5 parking lots are outside the resort, but they are not far away and can be reached within a 10-minute walk.
     Guests staying in the hotel can take a sightseeing bus to any scenic spot on the peninsula at any time. Peninsula Hot Spring, 5 minutes by car and 10 minutes by walk.
#È£üÂìÅ# Whether it‚Äôs the Qingboying Western Restaurant on the first floor or the Tianmu Yuting Chinese Restaurant on the ninth floor, they all have a first-line lake view, a large interior space, and the most important thing is that the food is so delicious. I especially recommend his fish head, which is first-class.
#ÊúçÂä°# All the staff in the resort are very enthusiastic and make the guests feel at home.
      When we checked in, the front desk manager was very careful and thoughtful to help us arrange the room, and invited Cui Minjun, a handsome guy, to serve us. He not only introduced the hotel facilities all the way when he took us to the room, but also greeted us every day, and he was very considerate if we needed help.
In addition, the security uncle in the parking lot, the cleaning lady in the hotel, and the waiters in the restaurant are all enthusiastic and thoughtful.
       Although the hotel hardware is not the latest, the hotel software is definitely advanced, and the most important thing is that the price is very affordable. In short, Tianmu Lake Hanti Resort is worth recommending.

The breakfast restaurant is very large, the scenery is also very good, and there are all kinds of things and delicious food.
The restaurant on the 9th floor has a great view, and the taste of the fish head is also full of praise.
Hu Hao, the manager of the lobby, also contacted in advance to ask which room type to choose.
The staff are very polite and will take the initiative to ask and help.
The cruise ship on the first floor of the hotel can go directly to the landscape garden, and then return to the hotel from Changxing Island, which is much more convenient.

The balcony is very wide, and you can see Tianmu Lake and the sunrise. If the weather is warmer, you can sit on the balcony to drink tea and enjoy the scenery.
There are many projects in the resort, and there are sightseeing cars to pick you up when you go out. The Hong Kong-style Ming stall is the most comfortable and refreshing meal I have eaten in the past few days. The Banshan Hot Spring is also a good place to enjoy the scenery, but the weather is relatively cold, so it should be warmer for soaking.
Overall very good, I can come again in summer when I have time.

Of course, compared with Yushui, I personally feel that Yushui is more convenient. The hotel environment is really good, the scenery on the top of the mountain is beautiful, refreshing, and comfortable to sit and drink a cup of tea.

This time I chose the hot spring double bed room, just for the convenience of soaking in the hot springs. After changing the clothes in the room, I can go directly to the hot springs after putting on the bathrobe in the room. The night view at night is beautiful, although it is a bit cold outside, but it can't stand the charming scenery, and there are various hot springs. The attitude of the waiters is also very good. I enjoyed the small fish pond. Although the net red infinity pool was not open because of the cold weather, you can take pictures. After soaking in the soup, it is very comfortable to have a massage. The techniques here are very good. The breakfast on the second day was also very good. The restaurant is very large and has many varieties. After eating, you can go for a walk by Tianmu Lake. In the afternoon, I also enjoyed the afternoon tea on the viewing platform, and after checking out the room, I made it again, and I felt very comfortable. The lobby of the hotel's main building is beautiful, facing the beauty of Tianmu Lake. Bring the family again in the future. Ctrip's package is very cost-effective.

msg:Overall satisfaction, the resort is very large, the facilities are relatively complete, and the breakfast is also very rich. It may also be too big, resulting in uneven service. There are good service staff, such as the aunt of Shan Hai Jing. But there are also those with bad attitudes, such as the security guards who manage the vehicles. I didn‚Äôt know the way for the first time, and my attitude was very bad when I asked for directions. I deliberately chose a lake view room, but I am not too satisfied with the scenery of his lake view room. If you want a better lake view, choose District 1; if you want a newer room, choose District 3. The room is very big and the sound insulation is very good. The first district is a bit old, but I think it is acceptable, especially those who pursue perfection are not suitable. I stayed with my children for two nights. Children above the first grade will be a little boring. No one told me what parent-child activities are available. The hotel has its own children's playground and farm, but it is suitable for young children, and older children will be bored. The commercial street of the hotel is very deserted, there is nothing to go shopping, and I don‚Äôt want to go there for the second time, but my baby loves the cat cafe in the commercial street, so I go every day for three days. The only dissatisfaction is that the hotel's food and beverages are too expensive, and it is inconvenient to go out to eat, but several restaurants in the hotel are very expensive. Especially the Chinese restaurant in the main building charges a 15% service tax, which is really outrageous.

There may be people who don't have a great travel experience in Yangkang, and there are not many people.
The hotel is located by the Tianmu Lake, and the whole environment moxibustion on the Tianmu Lake Ring Road gives people a very pleasant feeling. Resorts are even worse. The resort is lined with trees, rich in facilities, a variety of restaurants, and a variety of housing types.

facility:
We chose the hot spring room because we mainly used hot springs. The hot spring room can be directly connected to the hot spring area, so guests in other areas do not need to take the battery car back to the room after soaking in the hot spring. This is really the right choice.
The facilities in the hot spring room are ordinary, but the advantage is that you can change your clothes and go directly to the pool, and you don't need to spend 10 yuan to rent a bathrobe.
The hot spring is very good. It is very large on the mountain. You can see the lake in an area. The scenery is very good, especially when the sun is setting and the weather is very warm. But every pool time to walk is too cold at the end of December. Fortunately, there is ginger tea on the side of the road. The hot springs in the woods behind are good, and there are fewer people. Finding an unoccupied pool is equivalent to private hot springs.

health:
The room is clean. Some of the pools are a bit dirty, especially the ones near the lake. After all, there are too many people in the pool. The forest in the back is not bad.

Serve:
Hotel staff service is good. You can dine on the second floor of the hot spring room, a Hong Kong-style tea restaurant. The fish soup can improve the taste if you are tired of drinking it.
The overall service feels pretty good.

environment:
The environment is so good, this resort can stay for a day! Just look at the picture of the environment...

Hot spring: The hotel takes a sightseeing bus to the hot spring pool in 3 minutes. There are many pools. Every time you walk up the mountain, there is a pool. It‚Äôs too late to soak.

Whether it is the hot spring area or the room depar**ent of the restaurant depar**ent, they are very polite, patient and meticulous. The hotel's hot spring is also very distinctive. It is located on the mountainside, where you can enjoy the lake and mountains while soaking in the hot spring , and there are many types of hot springs. There is a mahjong pool where you can play mahjong, and a hot spring pool with slides for children to play. The breakfast variety is very rich. The fish head soup in the restaurant on the ninth floor is very delicious. Snacks, fruits, and yogurt are presented as gifts. Many of my friends have read my circle of friends and expressed their desire to come and play......
For this trip, I would like to thank two people in particular. One is Manager Hu in the lobby. Because when he was smoking on the balcony, a string of jadeite bracelets on his hand broke and fell downstairs from the 4th floor. Manager Hu picked me up. When we called, he took us to look for it immediately, and told me not to worry. If we couldn‚Äôt find it, we would ask colleagues from the hotel‚Äôs engineering depar**ent to help us find it. Fortunately, we found it successfully. I would like to express my thanks! !
The second person I want to thank is Xiao Huang (Huang Tixi) from the security depar**ent at the entrance of the hotel. He saw me with my child and helped me with my luggage very enthusiastically. He also saw that I was driving a sports car and was very careful at the entrance of the hotel. Arrange a parking space for me, tell me that your car is good, don't be touched by others, stay for two days, every time you go out to soak in the hot springs, brother Huang will greet us warmly when he sees us, and ask if we need help, thank you very much! !
Finally, as a senior traveler who spends more than 700,000 yuan a year on Ctrip hotel air tickets, I would like to make a small suggestion to the hotel: Since the hotel room has a mini bar and even Coke Sprite juice every day, it seems that only two bottles of mineral water are given each day. It‚Äôs not enough for someone like me who likes to drink tea. I usually bring a large bucket of 5 liters of mineral water with me when I go out. This time, because I drive a sports car, I don‚Äôt bother to bring it. It turns out that there is a vending machine at the elevator entrance of the hotel. There is no mineral water for sale. My six-year-old son said that even the vending machines in the hospital have mineral water... Moreover, as a hotel that pursues service, hotels around the world usually provide 4-6 bottles of mineral water in their rooms every day. Some will also place mineral water at the elevator entrance for guests in need. To be honest, apart from Evian in France, the most expensive domestically produced Baisui Mountain is only 2-3 yuan a bottle. As a resort hotel that charges about 1,000 yuan a night, it doesn‚Äôt cost much to put a few more bottles of mineral water in the room. ! ! Haha, personal opinion, for reference only.

msg:As a long-established hotel in Hantian, it is very mature.
Due to check-in on weekdays, the front desk helped to upgrade the mountain view suite. Room 708 is relatively upright compared to the room type. It has a bathtub and separate wet and dry. Although the decoration is a bit old, the brand bathroom has stable water flow and relatively constant water temperature. The toilet flushing is quick and the bedding is also soft and hard. There are reclining chairs in the room, which is very comfortable to rest on. The balcony is also an area that is not very popular in winter. The view from the mountain view room is limited, so it should not be as comfortable as the lake view. The room configuration is generally satisfactory.
The breakfast is really rich. The restaurant has floor-to-ceiling glass. By the lake, it's a beautiful thing to bask in the sun and look at the lake view during breakfast.
The service staff has a very strong sense of service. When checking in, the butler will lead the way to the room, and will introduce the hotel's infrastructure and the pick-up point of the shuttle bus along the way, which is very considerate.
2 hot spring tickets per room, 5 minutes by car from Banshan Hot Spring.
The next morning after lunch, I went up the mountain along the mountain path by the lake to collect wind. There were few people and the sun was very bright, so it was very comfortable. People from Yangkang were a little out of breath when climbing the mountain, but the scenery on the top of the mountain was suddenly enlightened. There was a boundless pool. It's suitable, it's so pleasant to sit in the sun, drink tea and look at the continuous mountain scenery in the distance. I flew the drone on the platform at the top of the mountain, because it is forbidden to fly in the park of the hotel. The scenery on the top of the mountain is good, there is no shelter, and the effect of the shooting is amazing.
The overall accommodation experience is very good, it is a good vacation experience, and it is also a relatively cost-effective hotel in the hot spring area.

The wifi is not very good, basically relying on 4G, and the layout of the socket is unreasonable. It is best to bring a mop board under the bedside table.

During the check-in period, he will answer questions at any time and help solve problems. He is very responsible and has a good attitude. High praise~
The hot springs are very good, there are many types, and the scenery is also very good. That is, soaking in hot and cold alternately in winter makes it easier to catch cold. Then remember to bring bathrobes from the hotel room, otherwise you can only rent them at the hot spring, 10 yuan/piece.
The environment of the restaurant for breakfast and the Yunding Tea Bar for afternoon tea are both very good~

Huang Zhimin, the manager of the lobby, called us one day before check-in to inform us of the epidemic prevention policy, reminded us to do nucleic acid, and asked about the requirements for the room. We are a family of three and learned that we have children I also prepared children's toiletries in advance, which is very thoughtful. When I entered the culvert, I was shocked. The whole resort is really big, the hotel environment is very good, and the scenery is also very good. From the moment you drive into the resort, you will see the garden landscape. In front of the lobby The floor-to-ceiling windows can also see a large area of Tianmu Lake. The lobby manager Huang Zhimin greeted us at the door as soon as we arrived at the entrance of the lobby, and helped us to bring a luggage cart to load our luggage. The service was really good, and then led us to the front desk to check in and wait. During the time, I prepared small toys for my son and felt the thoughtful service before checking in. After checking in, the lobby manager pushed the luggage cart and introduced me to the hotel‚Äôs restaurant and the amu*****t park for children. Notified the housekeeper to deliver the fruit. Before leaving, I added WeChat for fear that I would not remember the location. I also sent an introduction of the hotel on WeChat. The hotel is built next to mountains and rivers, so the lobby is on the 6th floor, and there is a gym in the main building of the hotel , ktv, bar, the hotel has a total of five restaurants, including Japanese cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, and local specialties, and the price is not very expensive. Personally, I recommend you to go to Chinese restaurants and Hong Kong-style Ming stalls. If you want to play, there are also commercial streets There are go-karts, off-road vehicles, archery, etc. There are two places you must go to. They are the hot springs and the viewing platform. There are many kinds of hot spring soup pools, and the outdoor and indoor scenery are also very good. The scenery on the Yunding viewing platform is really amazing. It‚Äôs very nice to take a picture, not to mention the service. It‚Äôs a caring one. When it‚Äôs time to eat, I will remind myself to go to eat. When is the best time to go to the scenery and the traffic is low. I will also help me plan my itinerary in the hotel. Which time to go and where to play, which time is the best scenery, and will wait for me in the lobby in advance and take it to the shuttle bus. The service is really good. Every once in a while, I will ask if there are enough supplies in my room. Give it to me. The hotel breakfast is on the first floor, which is the hydrophilic platform. There is a cruise ship dock next to the hydrophilic platform. You can take a boat to play on Tianmu Lake. There is also a path leading to the lake. There is a coffee bar. Walk in the path I also met a little squirrel and had afternoon tea, but I didn‚Äôt go to sit down this time due to time constraints. In the evening, I sat with my family in the lobby bar for a while and drank beer and milkshakes. The price is not too expensive, and the lake view at night is also special Beautiful, I will definitely stay for a few more days next time. I am very satisfied with the breakfast the next day. There are many varieties and delicious. When checking out, Huang Zhimin, the lobby manager, pushed the luggage cart to the room to help with luggage, and prepared drinks for us on the way Along the way, he also asked us whether we were satisfied with our stay in the hotel and what advice we could give him. He was really responsible and finally helped us put our luggage in the car and invited us to stay next time. This time Thank you very much for the thoughtful service of Huang Zhimin, the lobby manager, and the overall thoughtful service of Hantian Hotel. I will definitely come again next time.

msg:Great experience!
There are actually a lot of people this National Day, and they came out with psychological preparation. As a result, their service made me feel super good~

Accommodationüè®: The circuit in the room we booked was short-circuited and could not be repaired for a while. üè®The lobby manager Chen Mingshen and Li Erfeng accompanied my mother to see the other 2 room types of the same price for selection, and also told us the advantages and disadvantages, for us to choose from. In the end, I changed to a twin room called a standard room but more like a suite~

Service: When we called for room service on the 6th floor before, the room attendant Liu Xiuzhen saw that we had children and offered to provide us with milkü•õ and children's toiletries. Later, when the floor was not part of her service area, she also contacted Zhao Yun, the waiter on my floor, to help us deliver milk, fold elephant towels üêò, and prepare water and paper towels for our return journey before leaving.
The lobby manager Chen Mingshen who helped change rooms before, when I couldn't find the shuttle bus to contact him, he also called me quickly~

Environment: Due to the lack of rain levels this summer, the overall environment is still great. Originally, the 36-degree weather felt deserted when I went to the commercial street. As a result, if I go again at night, it is the a**osphere of a bonfire party, singingüé§, fireworksüéÜ, barbecue, and being on camera is really fun~

Food ü•£: Five stars! ! ! The first meal upon arrival was recommended outside according to the d review, so-so. The hotel üè® breakfast buffet is really great! It has been a long time since there are many buffets with guaranteed full taste, especially the scallion pancakes, which are invincible. I dazzled for 2 and a half in one goüòÇüòÇ I went to the Chinese restaurant on the 9th floor for dinner that night üç¥, the child ate half a plate of cabbage and bamboo shoots, braised pork and braised eggs were delicious, and black garlic beef, it was really special and good eat. Can't tell without the CD

Hot Spring‚ô®Ô∏è: I didn‚Äôt go because it was too hot the first two days and I checked out on the last day, but I can come again in winterü§©ü§©ü§©

I want to take a bath in my room and tell my aunt that she will take the trouble to disinfect us, including everything for the baby's quasi-book. It's very good, maybe it's because there aren't many people there during the week. The farm next to the road included in the package, I only found it after looking for it twice. There are a few lambs in a small corner of the entrance, in the mountains and seas. I spent the longest time in the children's playground. The two aunties were very good. They even made several balloons for my daughter. She liked it. On the third day, the waiter refused because my daughter didn't have breakfast and wanted to pack a little to eat. The one at the next table just took out the fresh-keeping bag and put it in a lot and didn't care. It's such a double standard. Later, I asked the front desk to take a box and put two egg tarts in it. I'll try it next weekend and there are not many people.

msg:The hotel environment is very good, but the room is really old, and the facilities need to be upgraded. The booked room type says that you can enter and leave the hot spring unlimited times. In fact, it is just a gimmick. The hot spring water in the room will not be full for a long time, maybe the waiter on the floor where I live is still warm, other staff are not online, the price of Chinese food in the hotel is inflated , a domestic hotel will charge a 15% service charge for dining? Scan the code with your mobile phone to order food, what do you serve? It can only be said that there are too many rich people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

When he saw us with the old man, he immediately came over to help us carry our luggage, then introduced the hotel facilities, introduced the places to eat and play, and said that you can find him if you need anything! When we left the hotel, he was very enthusiastic to help us take our luggage to the parking lot, and also gave us a souvenir, which was a great surprise!

Yesterday After get off work at 3 o'clock until 10 o'clock in the evening, he was still answering me, (without prior knowledge), I'm a little sorry, and I really appreciate it. When I left, I also gave a small gift to the children.

Mom and Dad, son and little niece all had a great time. Parents like to walk on the trails in the park, children like to have fun in the Shanhaijing and playground, and children's hot springs. My husband and I like to do sightseeing car rides. In short, if there is time in the future, there will be two more brushes, at least three days will be arranged, and one day will be able to do a cruise. [victory][victory][victory]

Where the hotel needs to be upgraded, the room facilities on the 8th floor are a bit outdated and can be upgraded. In addition, guests should avoid staying on the side close to the construction. Breakfast foods should be placed in covered containers and food safety should be taken into consideration. The sheep and ü¶ö in the small zoo should also be released when they have time to let them move, or the bird cage and the place where the üêë is closed should be enlarged to some extent. The living space is too narrow, which is not conducive to the growth of animals.

They will take care of children playing under the sun umbrella, instruct children to feed alpacas, and pay attention to safety when playing slides... Here, adults can take a break and let children play to their heart's content.
There are different pools every few meters in Banshan Hot Spring. Children like the fun pool, water fights, slides, and 4-year-old children are reluctant to go.
There is an infinity pool on the top of the mountain, the water is a bit cold, but the photo is very good.
There are shuttle buses wherever you go, which is very convenient. The little guy likes the aunt on the shuttle bus No. 23 very much.
Two days and one night, bring your baby, take a leisurely vacation in the beautiful Hantian, stop and go, not in a hurry, and very comfortable üëç

The hotel has a battery car shuttle, you can go to the commercial street and hot springs, which is very convenient. The hotel's dining is also good, the price is fair, and the restaurants can look at the lake. During the summer vacation, there are many guests, and the front desk is a bit slow. The downside is that the hotel facilities are outdated. There is only one socket at the head of the bed, and there is no hand shower in the shower. It is not very convenient to use. I hope it can be improved.

Environment: Tianmu Lake, hot spring resort, needless to say about the environment.
Service: This is to be praised. The first impression of many hotels determines the mood before arrival. The hotel will call the day before check-in to understand the room and personalized needs, help upgrade the room for free, and solve problems in a timely manner. The service of chief mate Yang Yang and front desk Wang Ning is also good and deserves praise.
Breakfast: There are many varieties and the taste is also good. Consider taking your family to the hot springs next time.

The scenery of Tianmu Lake is dazzling, and the beautiful scenery of the good day is so beautiful.
Staying in Hantian for 4 days and 3 nights, the location of the hotel is unique, and there is also a view in the hotel garden. Although it is facing a high temperature of 40 degrees, it does not feel hot at all, and children also like to play in the children's playground. The breakfast is plentiful. Although there are many people in the hotel, the arrangement is not messy at all, and there is never a shortage of dishes on the plate. I also took a boat to the Shanshui Garden in the hotel, strolled around, climbed the hills, and the pleasant times in life were roughly the same.
Thanks for the caring service of the butler. Will come again next time.

Due to the requirements of epidemic prevention, the problem of return and exchange time after negotiating with Ctrip customer service was solved very well, thank you! The three-hour drive from Shanghai that afternoon arrived at the resort very quickly. Unexpectedly, the occupancy rate was very high, and the car could only be parked at a distant location. After checking in, everyone in the elevator to the room didn't wear a mask, so I didn't get used to it all of a sudden! In general, the hotel environment is good, surrounded by Tianmu Lake, the scenery is very beautiful, it is a long-lost freedom for me who has been depressed for a long time. Room service and people in the resort can see that the daily training is good, mostly polite and friendly. The only thing is that the facilities in the Hidden Hills room are a little outdated, and some settings need to be more user-friendly.

msg:When I went to Liyang for vacation, I chose the family suite of the old five-star hotel Hantian Resort, mainly with my girlfriends and children. There is a children's play area in the lobby. When I arrived at the room, it was estimated that there were no welcome fruits and drinks due to the hasty cleaning time. I called the front desk. Later, the floor housekeepers Yuan Cuijuan and Gao Jianfang brought drinks and welcome fruits. Later, when we saw that we had children, they were kind to us. Brought a drying rack and kid's slippers and toothbrush. The most caring person was Yuan Cuijuan, the floor housekeeper. Knowing that we were going to play outside the hotel, he even prepared hats and fans for us. Originally, because of Ctrip members, only fruits were given on the same day. Butler Yuan would give us fruits every day. I have to leave on the last day, and he also said that he would send us drinks and water for us to drink on the way, which is very considerate! Really good experience.
Hantian's butler service makes people feel at home, especially cordial! Pick up and park at the hotel on call, very convenient.
Although there are many other options for Tianmu Lake, in terms of scenery, Hantian is indeed uniquely endowed by nature and occupies the most beautiful harbor. You can not only have a bird's-eye view of the entire Tianmu Lake from Genting, but also travel through the bamboo forests of the Hantian Peninsula and feel the nature. breath.
In these 3 days, the basic food is in the peninsula. The breakfast is very rich, there are basically everything you can think of, and it is added quickly, the restaurant is also very large, and there will be empty seats no matter what time you go. For lunch or dinner, if eating local food, then the fishing pier is a good value for money option. If you want to eat Cantonese food, there is HT Hong Kong-style tea restaurant. There are also Japanese and teppanyaki, which are very good choices and very convenient.
Another thing to mention is the Mid-level Hot Spring, which is included in the hotel package. The hotel is located in the V area, which is separate from the others, and the experience is good. Although there are many people during the summer vacation, the children like it very much. I went at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Although I didn't throw a few pools, it still couldn't block the beautiful scenery. It feels gentle or it will be more comfortable in winter.
There is also a need for improvement, that is, the socket of the hotel needs to be replaced, and some of the contact is not very good. And I hope that the next time I go, I can be equipped with a multi-function drag ***** with USB, so that the experience will be better.
In short, the overall feeling is still very good. I will come to vacation next time when the weather is cold. I hope that the shortcomings mentioned can be improved.
The overall feeling is as good as ever.

During the stay, the housekeepers Dan Cailan and Zhang Juying, and the lobby manager Huang Zhimin were very attentive and enthusiastic, especially Dan Cailan, the service was really meticulous. We didn't soak in the large bathtub on the first day, but we sent it on the next day. Disposable bathtub cover and help to cover it together. If you have any questions, she will reply promptly.
There are sightseeing buses in the hotel peninsula, which is also very convenient. When I went to the hot spring, there were too many people in the infinity pool. Otherwise, there would be fewer people, and the location should be very good; The food is a bit salty. The foot massage in the rest area is very good. The girls on the 28th and 6th are very professional, and they have answered many questions about meridians and acupoints in detail. I thought I would not soak the next day. The foot massage from the hot spring is indeed very comfortable after the massage on the day, but I asked that if you don‚Äôt take a hot spring, you need to do a package of 298 or more to enter. This is no different from a hot spring. It is recommended that the hotel can list the foot massage separately. , There is a special area in the hotel, I believe it will be very convenient for those who need it; the location of the Tianmu Imperial Court on the 9th floor of the hotel is really amazing, but I didn't sit by the window when I was late, but the fish head soup must be ordered, it's really good Eat, other dishes are also delicious, much better than the Ming stalls; there is a buffet breakfast on the first floor of the hotel every day from 7-10 am, which should be considered to be quite rich in variety, and the speed of replenishing dishes is very fast, but there are too many people. Too many, there is a queue for admission, and the lobby is too noisy, which slightly affects the dining experience.
But in general, coming to Tianmu Lake to choose Hantian is really the first choice, regardless of the environment, service, and supporting facilities. I will definitely order Hantian again next time I come.

I was worried that the facilities were a bit old at the hot spring next to the main building. It is more convenient to swim in the hot springs. There is no limit on the number of times a day. After playing, go directly to your room to take a bath. You don‚Äôt need to wash it here and then wear a big bathrobe on the sightseeing bus.
And every waiter here is very caring and will take care of many details. I especially want to commend Manager Wu Fen and the two older Aunt You and Aunt Zhang. When they saw that we had a baby, they added an extra bed and offered a swimming ring. I love to drink the hotel's longan and red jujube tea, and I took the initiative to help my baby change it. I also ate the dumplings made by my aunt. I kept asking me to get more. In short, all the services made people feel very simple and sincere.
The three-year-old child is very satisfied, and offered to say Mom, let's play one more day. Today coincides with the Qixi Festival, and the big bed room is full, so we will change to the suite next door, which is much bigger, especially suitable for families with children
I would also like to thank Aunt Li, our baby may have stained the quilt with the purple potion, so she quietly helped us wash it. In short, it is very warm and satisfying.
And we came from Shanghai. We had to go to the health depar**ent for nucleic acid testing. Auntie specially told us that the hotel was there the next day, which saved us a lot of time. Thank you.

In the evening, I went to the "fishing wharf" in the commercial street near the resort. The decoration is quite distinctive, and the taste of the dishes is also good. The average per capita is 100+
Originally, there was a barbecue night market and camping tents in the commercial street at night...because it was raining, it was also cancelled. The children returned to the hotel and played in the amusement park in the hotel for an hour, and returned to the room for a beautiful soak. Bath ü´ß
It's too wise to switch out the lake view room and replace it with a family suite. There are two rooms with two queen beds (in fact, these two 1.8 queen beds are replaced [laughing]) The bathroom is also large, with a bathtub, and the hotel's service is very good , Housekeepers in the housekeeping depar**ent: Gao Jianfang, Liu Xiuzhen, Yuan Cuijuan are very considerate and quick to answer any questions. There are sightseeing buses to pick up and drop off at Mid-level Hot Springs and Commercial Street. Before check-out, the housekeeper also specially prepared drinks to deliver to the room. In short, it was a very good hotel trip. ~ Such a service I think I am willing to choose them next time I travel!

msg:I took the elderly and children to stay for one night, a very fulfilling trip. I am very lucky to choose Hantian Resort. The whole resort is shuttled by sightseeing bus, which is very convenient. The facilities in the resort are enough to play for a long time. We chose the parent-child room. We lived in 4 adults and a 2-year-old baby. It was not crowded at all and was very comfortable.
    It is worth mentioning that the service staff of the resort are well-trained and very enthusiastic. As soon as I arrived at the door, the security guards Chen Jianjian and Xi Jinhe saw me with the elderly and children, and took the initiative to help me with the luggage, and also found a convenient parking space for me, thank you very much. After checking in, the room was unsatisfactory. The housekeeper Li Erfeng and the manager Huang Qian patiently helped me to adjust it several times. The family felt very satisfied with the room.
    Recommendation: A must-see item in Banshan Hot Springs, there are discounts for hotel guests. My favorite inside is the infinity pool, where I take pictures. Children can enjoy water slides and ocean balls. There is also Shanhaijing Paradise, where children feed alpacas (20 pieces of carrots), play with bubbles, and dig sand. The uphill road next to the Shanhaijing can reach the viewing platform. The top of the mountain has a view of the Dongting landscape, and the clouds and mists are enchanting, which is really unique. The fishing pier where I went to eat, the boiling fish fillets are really tender and delicious, and the decoration style is also amazing. Be sure to take a walk outdoors on the first floor of the hotel, the scenery is not inferior to the scenic spot.
       By the way, the Internet celebrity train is worth a ride, 15 yuan per person, and the whole journey takes about 17 minutes to enjoy the scenery of the island. Very friendly to the elderly and children. The fish head in Tianmu Lake is really delicious, and I will come again next time.

msg:The summer is really full of greenery, the environment is really great, and the hotel management in this regard is great! First mate Jiang Jiahua upgraded the room to the Peninsula Villa (I couldn't make an appointment with coupons before, so it was a lucky blessing). The housekeepers Dai Chunhong and Wang Ximei provided meticulous service, and the room pool was changed in time. The little friends had a lot of fun. Thank you! However, when accompanying the child in the hot spring infinity pool, the head did not touch the water. A male staff member reminded me to wear a swimming cap in a yin-yang way + rewarded a white eye. I was a little unhappy. We also abide by the rules, but I hope the staff can be more polite... In addition, the menu content when dining at the Japanese restaurant is inconsistent with the content on the table next door, and the amount of dishes is different. The waiter did not explain in advance, but just said that many dishes were not available, and the single-point cost-effectiveness was not high. I will not go again. The hotel's breakfast is a normal 4-star standard. If you want a shuttle bus, it will be faster to call the lobby, otherwise it will be torture to wait for one more minute in the 40-degree high temperature. I will take my family there again in autumn and winter, and I hope I won't encounter the yin-yang menu when eating.

msg:I remember the beautiful scenery of Tianmu Lake back then. I stayed at Hantian again after 10 years. Although the price has increased a lot, the decoration is old and has not changed at all. It can't be compared with the newly built hotels. In particular, the TV in the room is still the style of 20 years ago, which is particularly vicissitudes. The fish head soup in the restaurant is not as delicious as before, and the waiter brother didn't wear a mask well, revealing a greasy big nose, which was a bit disgustingüëÉ... But fortunately, the service specialist Yao Shouchen was quite polite (promised to give him a personal praise), and the hotel is generally not cost-effective. In addition, please note that this hotel has many tricks. The package you paid for, two large and one small hot springs, refers to heights less than 1.3m, not young age. My elementary school student was charged 188 because he exceeded the height, and he was not even allowed to make up the price difference. The front desk clerk was also tough, with a stern face, and did not allow negotiation. After paying, there was a 10-second network delay, and he was eager to chase me in the lobby to ask if I had paid. It was so embarrassing that my mood fell to the bottom in an instant. At night, the hot spring pool was filled with various insect corpses, grass, and leaves. The employees also wanted to go off work, and no one cleaned it. Many pools had no lights, especially the red Chinese medicine pool, which was dark and had no lights. Under the dim street lights, it glowed a strange blood red. The effect at night was really more terrifying than a horror movie! I retreated after soaking for half an hour. Finally, I said I wanted to give a bad review, and then a big sister who looked like a supervisor came out and refunded the price difference, saying that it was not easy for everyone to work, so I won‚Äôt give that bad review. . . Also, the breakfast is extremely low cost-effective. Anyway, you are charged 188 for a tall child. Maybe this is an important profit point for the hotel. In addition, you must buy the 270 mountain and water park ticket to take the cruise, and you can't buy it separately. In addition, parking is not convenient. You can only park on the side of the road. The internal traffic is chaotic. I also witnessed a car accident in which a guest's car hit the designated driver. The guy was lying on the ground, unable to move, and was sent away on a stretcher. It was really pitiful. The guest was also depressed. The next day, when I was having dinner at another hotel, I received a return call to ask for opinions. I said a few words and then started to apologize in a template-like manner, saying that I must give you a response, etc. There was no substantive content. I don't know why you called me. Do you want me to recall unhappy things again? ! All of the above are really petty and messy! I probably won't stay again, 88!

Finally, it is also great to praise Miss Zhou Yulan and Miss Cen Meiling (should be this name hahahaha). As soon as we entered the door, he asked us if we needed coffee‚òïÔ∏è black tea, and prepared it in advance, and also specially arranged a car for us.
It is really rare to encounter such a good service attitude and environment hahahahahahahaha my grandmother also asks to come back next time

There are not many children to play in the children's playground next to the lobby. The large lawn on the first floor can be used for reference. Family-friendly hotels in Sanya do some activities
The hot spring is quite ordinary, the children's pool is also aging, and the shade of the trees causes the water to be full of insects, but the children don't care, they still have a lot of fun
Thanks to the hotel for upgrading the room, the children in the Lego room had a good time, but there is a little musty smell, and it is estimated that there is little ventilation
The staff are very kind and warm, and the overall is still very happy. The lake view is beautiful

This time, I was very fortunate to be able to grab the Hantian Resort Hotel package with 999 three days and two nights and two hot spring tickets on Ctrip. So I chose Valentine's Day and Lantern Festival to go. Although it is a pity, because of the decoration of the lobby and Chinese restaurant of Hantian Resort Hotel, I changed to the Songguo Hotel under Hantian in a park. But helped us upgrade to a tatami twin room. The room is new, the floor heating air conditioner is very warm. Breakfast is eaten at the fishing pier next door, and the variety is also very rich. The Hantian Park is very big, and there are free shuttles for sightseeing cars wherever you want to go. The next day, I went to the hot spring. Auntie Zhang Liuji was very considerate. She brought us ginger tea to ward off the cold and provided us with bathrobes for free. The service was really thoughtful. Living in the beautiful Hantian Park, tasting big fish head casserole soup, and soaking in the hot spring with lake view on the top of the mountain is really enjoyable. It's a place I want to go.

The hot springs in the park, the high-end Yangxin villa area, various restaurants, green landscapes, and commercial streets for homestays...enough to spend a leisurely day. The hot spring is on the mountain, and there are more than 40 open-air pools. The water quality is so clear that I have no worries about the small cleanliness! Lying by the pool or overlooking Tianmu Lake, or looking up at the starry sky through the treetops, enjoy it~ Unfortunately, I didn't bring my mobile phone, and I couldn't take pictures. It's a pity that the hotel management is standardized and the standard is very high. I booked a family suite, 70 square meters Great room, very comfortable! From the moment of check-in, I have enjoyed warm, thoughtful and decent service. The lobby manager Fu Peiran, the housekeeping depar**ent Zhu Lanfen, Shi Feng, Yuan Cuijuan, the cleaning staff Dan Cailan, Zhao Yun, the restaurant Cen Meiling, and many unknown service staff , all make an excellent impression. The buffet of Chinese and Western food for breakfast has a wide variety and tastes very good. My family is very satisfied. Due to the epidemic, there are not many guests, especially the homestay is a little deserted, but it is still brightly lit, romantic, warm and artistic. It is meticulously managed, and it is very touching... I hope that life will return to the right track one day, business is booming here, and it will be lively! In addition to the hotel's restaurant, there are several specialty restaurants, Japanese food, fishing wharf, Hong Kong style, French style... I can't eat all of them because of time, but I will not regret what I have eaten. This is the first time I wrote such a long comment because I like it from the bottom of my heart, and I will definitely come back in the future! I'm sure everyone who's been here will feel the same way!

üîîService: The service is very nice. They are super polite. The person in charge of Baotou is very good, but the security of the parking lot is a bit fierce, so I will be impatient to ask a few more questionsüòÖ

This time it's a family trip! Bring the elders and children to play together! Can't go out! Liyang is definitely a good choice! Bubble hot springs and see the scenery! Eat fish head! Play with the babies! Vacation is great!

By the way, after all, they are all scenic spots, so you can bring more snacks! If you are hungry in the middle of the night, you can eat anytime haha!
Breakfast must be eaten! 7:00-10:00! The most important thing! It also surprised me the most! It can be packed! This is my first time seeing it! Absolute child! So friendly! It's so good for a child who can't get up! The master can eat first and then pack it to the children in the roomüßí! Awesome!


Double Hantian Banshan Hot Spring Ticket: I also went to the hot spring this time! It's not the first time, but the baby likes water so much! ‚ö†Ô∏èChildren must pay attention to keep warm! Wrap it in a blanket after getting out of the water! The hotel has a car to pick up and drop off. Friendly reminder üîî: Bathrobes can be brought to the hotel! Otherwise, the hot spring area is rented for 20 yuan once!

A great family trip! Not the first time! It won't be the last time! Looking forward to the next trip~

msg:It was my first time to Hantian Hot Spring Resort in Tianmu Lake Tourist Resort. The entire resort is very large, including several hotels and villa-type hotels. This time I stayed at the Hantian Resort Hotel near the lake. The Spring Festival package includes a double-bed room with a half-mountain hot spring coupon and a Nanshan Bamboo Garden sightseeing coupon. The scenery is beautiful, although it is a cold winter and it rains continuously, but you can get a panoramic view of the lake and water when you climb up the mountain; you can walk on the lake embankment, peaceful and sober; because of the limited time, you only enjoy the hot springs in the middle of the mountain for a few hours, and did not go to the bamboo forest. The hot spring soup place is very large. Due to personal preference, I negotiated with the management staff to pay the reserved fee and enjoy the private soup for 2 people exclusively. A middle-aged eldest sister named "Zhang Liuji" was very enthusiastic in delivering ginger tea and fruit to meet my needs. Special thanks!
There is also a receptionist in the front hall of the hotel called "Liu Qixing" who guided him all the way to the room and introduced the hotel situation. He also specially reminded him to add WeChat to find him any time. Sure enough, after dinner in the commercial street at night, it was cold and rainy and couldn't go back. Finally, I contacted him and personally drove over to pick us up with the female driver of the battery car. Very impressed and worthy of praiseüëç
The Chinese restaurant wants to buy the advertised New Year's gift bag after eating the special fish head soup and other delicacies. As a result, the female administrator of the restaurant's WeChat called "Dao Dian Dian" tried her best to inquire about how to get in touch with us. In short, everyone does not complain or hide from active service
Another suggestion: It is mainly during the peak holiday season. Although the breakfast hall is very large, there are still too many people and the experience is poor, which offsets the goodwill of delicious food. It is recommended to warn guests at the time of check-in to also notify the high and low closing time of breakfast, and to confirm the choice of dining time for guests due to the difference between early and late risers. Control crowding. In addition, make a small reminder board and put it on the table, in addition to civilized language such as warning reasonable use, write "end the meal" on the one hand, and write "continue to eat" on the other hand. It can allow service staff to identify guests and improve the turnover rate of turn over. The above is for reference only!
The overall feeling is that this stay is very pleasant, and I will continue to choose for future vacations

Unfortunately, it is raining and many projects have not been experienced. , I have already thought about waiting for the summer vacation to come again. The only small defect, maybe we ordered a special big bed room, the decoration inside is average, especially the bathroom, there is no place to hang towels. It's hard, next time I have to experience a higher-end room.
3. Food and beverages: This time, I checked in the Hong Kong-style Mingxing restaurant. The taste is much better than we imagined. The food and beverages in ordinary scenic spots are very difficult to eat. I was not disappointed this time. Crispy Pigeon. The hotel's breakfast is also very rich, that is, you have to queue up during peak hours. Next time I go to check in other food...
Overall it was a very pleasant trip...deserving of my praise

msg:This is the second time I come to Hantian for vacation. The hotel took the initiative to upgrade us a twin room with lake view. The experience is as good as ever. The room is clean and well organized. There are many kinds of breakfast, and the service is attentive and thoughtful. The service staff of the breakfast restaurant on the first floor, Zhou Yulan , Wang Yuzhen warmly gave the children a bag of fruit, and asked about our various needs with concern. Cao Xianzhi, the service staff of the hot spring hall, warmly showed us the way, provided towels, and dried our swimsuits for us. Even though it has been rainy and cold these days, it did not affect our mood. Next time we come to Liyang, we will choose Hantian.

msg:Worst stay experience ever. Front desk service is extremely unprofessional. Broke our whole happy holiday mood! We drove from Shanghai to Hantian Resort for nearly 4 hours. We checked in from the hotel at 4 pm. When we arrived at the hot spring hotel front desk, we were told that the air conditioner in the room assigned to us was broken. We had to wait for a few hours. The specific time it takes to get a room or repair the air conditioner, we are also very tired after the long journey, and hope to check in quickly. The front desk told us that there is no other room for us to understand them. Excuse me? Who understands the feeling that we've been driving so long and we're on vacation? ? After waiting for more than 2 hours, I was told that I could check in. After checking in, I found that the room was smaller and older than expected. We temporarily changed our mind from 2 nights to just 1 night, so I went to Ctrip and asked the customer service to cancel the stay the night after the next night. Unexpectedly, a strange thing happened: the hotel attendant came to our room and knocked on the door frantically, and asked us to go downstairs to pay the room fee immediately. I said that I had already paid for the room on Ctrip, and showed the payment page, the waiter asked me to come on the spot. Desk phone. After the call was connected, I explained again that I had paid on Ctrip and I had contacted Ctrip for them to communicate with the hotel. The front desk said again that they did not receive the Ctrip money, and asked me to pay them in cash now. I really don't understand. If the hotel can't receive the money from the third party, it will make the customer buy the order twice? In the end, I quickly contacted Ctrip customer service again and asked them to contact the hotel immediately, and the matter was resolved. It was obviously a communication problem between the hotel and Ctrip, and the result affected our guests. After the whole thing was over, although the happy and happy mood of the vacation was completely broken, I was also glad that I made the right decision to only stay for one night and hurry up~~

Recommender: Songguo lobby manager: Wang Jie
Now upgrade the butler service WeChat call. Much more convenient than calling the front desk

In short, I have not been particularly satisfied with the first phase of the hotel, after all, it is old. This time I went to the part to have started to renovate. I hope that I will have another surprise next time. There is still a lot of freshness for the second phase.
Parent-child, team building, family and couples have corresponding themes and rooms.
It has been four years since the last move in, from the maintenance to the current upgrade phase two. More and more mature. The scenery of the public area is still the same as before, only to see it getting better and better.
Of course, the most important feature is the hot spring. I have never been to a hot spring with a better environment. Is my first choice for vacation. Unfortunately, some areas are not open because of the epidemic ‚òπÔ∏è But it doesn‚Äôt matter, it will always be better. That is, the hot spring indoor changing room can be reorganized. It is indeed old and the same as the hotelü§≠
ps: The service is very good. Auntie gave me a bathrobe and said don‚Äôt catch cold.
Recommender: Chen Judi.

A plastic bag for the phone is also provided, which is so thoughtful

I told the waiter about the situation. , Speaking of personal taste, it‚Äôs not a matter of ingredients, haven‚Äôt I ever eaten yam? ? Well, anyway, I won't go to eat next time. I have stayed at this resort three times, each time for more than 2 nights, I think I will not go again next time, 88

From 7:00 to 11:00 in the morning, the sound of beating and electric drill was endless. The sound of the electric drill was upstairs, the ceiling was vibrating, everyone was numb, the hypotension was cured, and the experience was negative. (See the video for the power drill, speechless)
Others, hot springs, restaurants, etc., I think the service is more in place, and the hot springs are relatively late. Chen Judi, Yu Zehui, Chen Ju and several others are very considerate, and they are worried that the guests will be cold and deliver bath towels in time, which is worthy of praise.

The lobby manager Chen Yuze personally took us to the room and delayed the check-out for me, because the child had to surf the Internet the next day. . The room housekeeper Zhang Juying brought Duluan noodles to my mother, because the old man didn't want to eat teppanyaki with me, she also brought children toothbrush sets and slippers to my son, which made us feel at home. In addition, the environment is also good. In addition to walking around the lake, there is also an outdoor amu*****t park for children. The hottest thing is the hot spring, which is also equipped with a swimming pool. The children have a great time. Ladies and sisters who want to take beautiful photos can also come here. The internet celebrities check in, and you will never be disappointed. Recommend recommended!

If he couldn't leave Changzhou, he took him to Liyang Hantian for vacation again. This hotel is the hotel designated by my son. This time the hotel caught up with the epidemic and upgraded the Hantian Yangxingu Villa for us. We were fortunate to experience the green and exquisite design of Yangxingu, and everything was quiet and elegant. The service of Hantian Resort Hotel is first-class, and this is the kingly way of the hotel's survival. Thanks to Zhao Guifang and Yin Yajun, who are responsible for the sanitation in the villa area, for their responsibility and careful cleaning. They send many bottles of water every day, as well as a box of fruit and small snacks. And also helped me to take back the clothes hanging on the balcony in time to avoid the heavy rain. Finally, special thanks to Manager Luo Deng from Yangxingu. From the first day of check-in to the fourth day of departure, you can see your hard work, meticulous and courteous attitude towards guests. In short, the family was very satisfied and happy during this holiday in Hantian. Look forward to your next stay.

The room type booked earlier did not inform me that it was closed due to the epidemic. After communication, I arrived at the hotel on the same day, Manager Wang Jinju and Master Meng took me to see the room on the spot. I finally chose and upgraded to the Peninsula Villa Lake View Room for free, which completely satisfied me. The scenery service of Hantian Resort is nothing to say. It‚Äôs a pity that I didn‚Äôt see the starry sky in the light rain that day, but I saw the sunrise on the second day. It was beautiful. The strategy is two routes. The first one is to Hantian. In the main hotel building, go down to the water platform on the first floor, where the lake and mountains are not too obstructed. The second one is to go to the main building of the hotel, in front of the auxiliary building, rent an electric car (ps, don‚Äôt leave the trunk indiscriminately, you can‚Äôt open it if you close it, if you want to open it and ask the tram aunt in the main building for help), free ride, go to Near the parking lot of the main building, Pan Banshan, or near Linghu Bay, there are also highlands, and wild ducks and the like. In addition, PS: The hot spring milk pool, wearing a black swimsuit will attach white bath salt, especially obvious, very embarrassing.

I arrived at the resort within 3 and a half hours from Shanghai. The check-in process went smoothly. I gave the assistant manager Tang Fuxin a thumbs-up. The check-in day happened to be Xiaobao‚Äôs birthday. The hotel sent cakes. During the period, I troubled the young lady many times. The attitude was very good. it is good. I also wrote warm greeting cards with Ms. Jiangning (it should be a young lady) to the baby, as well as super cute pictures.
There is a shuttle bus to and from the resort. Sister Gan Guizhen, a driver's license, I met when I was out for food, was very enthusiastic and helped us introduce nearby attractions and food.
For dinner, I chose the fishing wharf in the commercial street. The fish head soup is definitely the point. The taste of braised duck head is amazing.
When I checked out, my sister left her mobile phone in the room. The eldest sister of the room service found out and returned it to her elder sister. The elder sister did not see her name clearly. She was the eldest sister who served in room 1619 on the morning of July 14. Thank you very much.

She takes the child to the bathroom and sends cute hairpins to the baby. What a pity the restaurant I didn't remember their names. One day, the supervisor prepared fruit and yogurt to eat with the children on the road. It was so sweet. The guest room supervisor Shi Feng was particularly touched. We were going back. We actually prepared drinks and fruits, slippers, etc., and put them in the room. It was so pleasant and unexpected. We will definitely come to Tianmuhu Hantian for our vacation next year.

It is no exaggeration to say that it is not too lazy to go around. It is beautiful to take photos without buying tickets. There is a battery car to pick you up when you go out. It is so convenient. Secondly, a good hotel not only needs good hardware facilities, but the most important thing is service. This time it really made me feel at home and the customer is God. Here, the real name praised the floor butler Dan Cailan, and the service attitude was particularly good. Knowing that we stayed four nights in a row, we enthusiastically delivered three fruit drinks and couldn't finish eating. My daughter wanted to take a bath at night. I asked if there was a disposable bathtub cover. Not only did I send a bathtub cover, but also a bubble bath intimately, which made my daughter feel happy and comfortable, and the night shift housekeeper Zhang Juying also had a very good service attitude. it is good. In addition, I want to give special praise to Huang Chunhong, the driver of the battery car. She thinks what customers think, and actively provides thoughtful and enthusiastic service. We are going to check out on the last day. I want to take pictures in the resort, but because of bad knees The resort is very large, and it is not convenient for me to walk long distances and stairs. After learning about it, Aunt Huang Chunhong drove me to any place where I wanted to check in with a battery car. She also deliberately drove me to the mountain top tea bar to check in. I was very moved. The breakfast in the restaurant is quite rich and the service is very good. My daughter wanted to sleep in for two days and couldn't go to the restaurant for breakfast. After discussing with the waiter in the restaurant, I also asked me to take it back to the room. I was very satisfied with this. In short, this vacation was very enjoyable. After I came back, I decided to choose Anji Hantian Resort as my next vacation place. Hantian is the quality assurance and the satisfaction is 100%.

Less, you can look at the lake view by the window, the dishes and services are very good, absolutely worthy of 5 stars & dinner. We took the free shuttle bus to the Hong Kong-style Ming stalls. The meals in the Ming stalls obviously do not match the price. It was changed without the customer‚Äôs consent, and the food was served directly. There are more people, and the service is really average. The amount of food for 5 of us was ordered according to the standard of 8 people. There was no waste. At first, I was told by the service staff that there might be more. Actually The dishes are small and the taste is very average. It should be because the kitchen is too busy, and all the services are simplified! Here can only give a bad review of the Hong Kong-style bright file!) Secondly, just talk about the check-in experience, which coincides with the check-in On Saturday, I encountered a super-many team to check out. The people in the lobby lounge and the sofa area appeared to be crowded and messy, but the overall front desk and baggage depar**ent services were not neglected, and the check-in and check-out were handled quickly. A housekeeper is responsible for the floor. Daily life (Xu Sifeng, Zhu Lanfen, Zhang Juying) take the initiative to care about the needs, give guidance on play, and send gifts and fruits and juices to the little pot friends. The sense of service is strong, thank you, here must give you five stars~

Simple and enthusiastic. Start from parking, check in, lead into the room, introduce the basic situation, so that we can better play. Sightseeing car shuttle service is very good. . I felt cold in bed at night and immediately added a quilt. Seeing that we were the three of us, we also took the initiative to add toiletries and slippers, and gave us a fruit plate. We ate at the restaurant on the ninth floor. We want to thank a fat little brother for his reminder, so that we can avoid waste, but unfortunately forgot to read the name of the little brother. The food in the restaurant is delicious, the fish soup is very good, the price is not very expensive, you can come and eat. The breakfast buffet is great, with many choices, complete categories, good taste, and great value. The restaurants in Hantian are good, so don‚Äôt bother to eat. I also felt good service when I was in the hot springs. Aunt Hu Jing gave us caring service. Aunt Pang Li accompanied and introduced us to give us fruit plates and water throughout the whole process. We felt very warm. Thanks also to Aunt Zhang Liuji for the mung beans. The soup is delicious and timely. The experience of this trip is very good, next time I want to bring my family together.

msg:The first time I came to Tianmu Lake Hantian, I left a very good impression üëåüèª
It was about 3 hours by car from Shanghai. At noon, I found a family at Shanxia Farmhouse and quickly sent lunch. We arrived at the parking lot at mid-levels after 2 o‚Äôclock. We received a warm Master Zhou Qijun who helped us carry our luggage all the way to the lobby to check in. Contact the staff in the lobby to take the luggage cart to help us to the room. Very enthusiastic.
We booked a family room with lake view, the room is so big, I feel that 3 children can also live completely, haha üòÉ, the scenery is very good and quiet, sitting on the balcony in a daze is very comfortable.
There is a warm greeting no matter where you go in the hotel. Yang Mingying and Aunt Xu Qunying in the children's playground enthusiastically made bubbles for the children and fed the animals.
Hot springs may be related to workdays. It can be described as a private room, which is too comfortable. Yang Mingying was very considerate during the internship. We provided water and towels. Thank you very much.
Since the hotel is so big that every point requires a short-distance battery car, Captain Zhang Min is very good, and he introduced us to many places. The ride is very comfortable, and the children are very happy.

The only thing that was lacking was the restaurant in this hotel. We ate 3 restaurants, one was on the 9th floor of the hotel, and the service charge was 15%. But the service is far from keeping up with the price. The taste of the dishes is average, without special features, and the fish head soup is not very amazing. The other is Fish Wharf, and the dishes are very salty. In the end, the Hong Kong-style restaurant chose the set meal plus the a la carte dishes, and there is a service charge, which is slightly better.

In short, this trip is still very satisfactory. It is recommended to bring a family with a baby.

msg:The hot spring hotel, which has been famous for a long time, finally started a three-day and two-night trip to Hantian with two children! When I arrived on Sunday, there were too many parking spaces and it was too difficult to find. I happened to run into a lovely uncle Zhou Qijun who helped me find a parking space. Little brother Li Qingpu sent our luggage to the room and gave us a brief introduction to the hotel's facilities. With a five-year-old and a two-year-old child, we did not leave the resort for three days. It is really suitable for parent-child travel. After checking in, I took the children to the trampoline game hall in the commercial street to spend an afternoon, and the children enjoyed themselves very much. The next morning, I went to the Shanhaijing Amusement Park to walk the alpaca, played with bubbles, digging in the sand, and had a great time. After a nap in the afternoon, I went to Mid-Levels Hot Springs. After soaking in the hot springs, I lay down in the rest area on the second floor to eat and eat. It was very uncomfortable. The third morning was spent in the children's play area in the lobby. After a journey, I have sighed countless times that the service here is not lost to Haidilao! At that time, the theme room of the small submarine column was well enough for a family of four. Next time I decide to bring my parents and make an appoin**ent with Hantian Resort!

Room facilities, mainly the old toilet. The sofa should be vacuumed, it's a bit dirty.
Bathrobes and towels are all new, but bathrobes are very new, so too much lint should be dealt with.
The breakfast was great and the lake view was beautiful.
The best is the Mid-Levels Hot Springs, the scenery is invincible. The service is also very good, and the parents are very satisfied.
There are not many pedestrians on the staggered peak, and will come next time.

Arrived at noon, Ms. Yang Yinghua at the front desk helped me check in. Because the last group of guests had just checked out and there was no time to clean, Yang Yinghua was anxious and called the cleaning aunt to grab the room and recommended a place to visit in the resort. , Very considerate, I can eat casually at the Hong Kong-style Ming Dang at noon, but the taste is old and not expensive, the manager Chen Laisheng, the service is very professional, and the tone of Cantonese, help us recommend dishes. After lunch, I went to Hantian Yangxingu for digestion. It was super awesome, the environment is good, and the artistic conception is beautiful. Next time, I will be cruel and live in Yangxingu.

It was timely, and the solution given was acceptable, that is, the same room would give us an extra day. At that time, a general manager from Yangxingu came out, called Wang Jinju, who kept promising that he could stay for a day free of charge, or he could come at any time for free. We stayed for one day, but when we booked again after 3 months, Mr. Wang Jinju said in disgust, who agreed? I don't think this is a management issue anymore, so a person with such a good character can be a general manager? ? ? We are just a weak commoner. We can‚Äôt do anything in the face of such a big hotel, and we will tell you from the front desk that you should not book a hotel from the Ctrip platform. It will be more expensive. You can directly contact us to make a reservation. Integrity management Who dares to book directly for you next time? ? ? I regret that I did not contact the platform in time to keep evidence at that time. Such a disgusting hotel will definitely not stay next time! It is not recommended to stay even more.

No matter which scenic spot you go to, there are shuttle buses to pick you up, which is very convenient! The room is also very clean, and the big bed is very big and soft to sleep on! Account manager Wang Jie is very enthusiastic and patient. He added WeChat one day in advance and asked us what we needed! Because we have children, we hope that the two rooms can be arranged together, preferably facing the lake! I didn't expect it to be done! Aunt Zhang Juying, the housekeeper, is also very considerate. She always has a smile on her face and asks us what we are missing and what we need? The free travel photography is also very good, especially the photographer Xiao Fan, a sunny boy with good photography skills. I am very satisfied with the photos I took and all the requirements we put forward are met. This trip is very happy. Hantian is indeed well-deserved and is a very good hotel!
