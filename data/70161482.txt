msg:Myself and my girlfriend spent only 1 night at the Sofitel. Even in this short period of time, our stay was a memorable one. Starting from the warm welcome at the lobby area on the 1st floor with luggage assistance, until our departure from the same place when the kind Concierge staff assisted us get a transfer to the train station while we were not able to do it (didi) due to the business generated by the Chinese New Year. At the Front Desk, Echo welcomed us with a warm sincere smile and showed a high level of confidence and product knowledge while highlighting the hotel facilities. Moreover, she went above and beyond our expectation when she recommended the hotel restaurant and few dishes when she heard my girlfriend telling me she is hungry. Another memorable experience was our SPA treatment where the staff were very friendly and professional. Overall, the hotel feels very new with, the location is great and the level of cleanness is very satisfactory. We will defiantly return to Sofitel if business or leisure will bring us back to Haikou.

msg:Great hotel, really good breakfast, new, modern and very clean. There were, however, 2 problems. We asked for interconnecting rooms before arrival and the hotel stated this would be okay. When we arrived, we were told interconnecting rooms were not available, which was a little frustrating. Also, the hotel is non smoking, but a number of guests ignored this and were smoking at the buffet dinner or in their rooms/public areas. Disappointingly some staff ignored the fact guests were smoking and did not take any action to stop them. Hence my lower rating for service. That said our rooms were lovely and the overall experience was very good.

I get a confused reply from the customer service manager about what I am talking about. I ask for a manager who is also confused about their advertised late night menu. I then proceeded to tell them about my disappointment at which point I have to go down, in my pajamas, to the first floor (to which the lobby is on the 35thfloor) to relieve my McDonald’s which I hate eating

msg:I have previously stayed at the Sofitel in Haitang Bay a few times so am quite familiar with their style and service and I have to say Sofitel. haikou actually exceeded my expectations. Considering it is just in a tall building, they've done a very good job to give it a 'resort' feel. They've achieved this through really excellent customer service and with decent facilities. The rooftop pool is nice and has sunbeds around the side (not really visible in the photos). I always value a gym in a hotel and I am a lift weights alot and I would say this is one of the best hotel gyms I've been to that isn't an actual commercial gym. It has a good enough range of equipment for anyone who regularly goes to the gym.

We also had the club access and the ladies who worked in the clubroom, Kristy and Shirley were excellent and very friendly and accommodating. 

The level of English was also very good and I also appreciated that reception allowed me to check out at 4pm at no extra cost, which is always a good representation of customer service.

Would recommend if you want resort vibes in the middle of the city.

Coming from the Fairmont Sanya to the Sofitel Haikou, I felt at home. I was very happy. The drinking water was also specially packaged, which was very beautiful.

Sofitel is smarter than Fairmont. The windows, mirrors, and toilets are all smart, which is great!

There is also a boss speaker in the room, which is really awesome!

The hotel's breakfast has fewer options than the Fairmont Sanya, but it is still richer and more exciting than the Hilton Haikou next door! The sea view is also beautiful!

I will stay here again if I have the chance. I stayed for a total of 2 nights. Parking is free. The parking lot downstairs is very spacious. The lower floor (3rd floor) is pure k. I went downstairs to sing. I was so happy~

msg:This is the most satisfying hotel I have stayed in in the past 2 or 3 years. Although it is not a parent-child hotel, the environment, sanitation, facilities and services are better than those of special parent-child hotels.
First of all, the hotel is in a good location, close to the surrounding commercial complexes, supermarkets and parks;
Second, the hotel has a first-class view, from the front desk (35th floor), restaurant (34th floor) to the room, the whole view is very good; the hotel design is also very good, visually pleasing;
Third, the room is quiet and well-equipped, especially the HDMI interface design next to the desk, which is very convenient to directly project the iPad video onto the island TV without having to mess with the TV jack, which is very convenient for children to play cartoons;
Fourth, the service is in place. Call the room service number and the service staff will come to the door in about 5 minutes. The response speed is very fast. Welcome fruits and snacks are also provided, which is very good;
Fifth, the breakfast tastes good, with Hainan specialty food.
The only drawback: the buffet dinner category is relatively small, and the food taste and raw materials are relatively average (the meat is very hard, especially the barbecue, and the sashimi quality is not very good), and the price-performance ratio is average

First of all, let's talk about the advantages. When checking in from the front desk, the front desk staff was very warm and thoughtful, and made many warm reminders. The room staff and other staff were very good. This is also the only experience I felt during this stay. Other places are really very bad. First of all, this drinking water, you claim to use this packaging for environmental protection, but it can't be closed after opening. If I go out with it, do I have to hold it with my hands all the time? I took a sip in the car and thought it was a waste to throw it away. If I don't throw it away, I can't put it. I called to ask if other types of drinking water can be provided, but there is no one, and it tastes very strange when I drink it in my mouth. Then I talked about the room facilities. The wardrobe opened very loudly. It felt like this wardrobe had been used for 20 years. The painting hanging on the side of the TV wall in the room was also very abrupt. The white and gray tones had a woman's big red lips, which was really uncomfortable to look at. The hair dryer was also very difficult to use. I had to pinch it all the time, and it was very slow to dry. I thought it was just because my hair was long that it was slow. My friend has short, fine hair and it was also slow to dry. Fortunately, I called and they sent a slightly better one. I don't know which one of your hotel purchasing depar**ents was so smart to choose this piece of junk. Doesn't he need to blow dry his hair? They just picked the most disgusting one and put it in the room for customers to use. After talking about the room, let me talk about the gym in your hotel. Your elevator shows that it is on the sixth floor. Why do I need to take a narrow spiral staircase down to the fifth floor to get there? I was very tired after the exercise and I had to climb this narrow spiral staircase to the sixth floor, and then take the elevator back to the room. I don't know which one of you was so smart to design this. It was really a terrible stay experience. It was very bad. I don't want to come again.

The only drawback was that the water in the room's sink smelled a bit. I hope it can be improved. When I arrived, the concierge helped me open the door and carry my luggage to the lobby. He was very polite. He even helped me carry my luggage to the car when I left. This is not possible in many hotels. I would like to thank Brother Luke for his great service.

The high-altitude view is beautiful, the bedding is also very comfortable, and the room service will quickly solve all needs. 👍Every day after going out, it is very comfortable to have afternoon tea in the executive lounge. I especially praise Miss Skye and Brother Paton in the executive lounge. The service has a sense of boundaries, professional, thoughtful and meticulous. The food is exquisite and tastes good, the cocktails are delicious, and they will recommend flavors according to my preferences. 🥂 My family likes the executive lounge very much, and I will choose here next time❤️

The sea view is amazing! ! ! It's really cozy!
The hotel breakfast is also very rich! Breakfast every day has become my motivation to get up!
The gym equipment is really good, and there is also a swimming pool! And there are not many people, facing Haikou Middle School, an hour of aerobics is easy!
The executive lounge also has afternoon tea! I can't eat it at all! There are also wine and drinks in the evening! The main point is that you don't have to leave the hotel! 
Satisfied👍🏻

Because we were traveling with children, we asked if we could add a small bed. When we arrived at the hotel, we really felt at home. Every service staff was very enthusiastic. No matter where you are, as long as you have a problem, someone will help you solve it in the first time. The hotel environment is very good and quiet. We rented a car, so it is convenient to go everywhere. It takes only a few minutes to drive to the duty-free shop. The hotel has hot springs and the beach is opposite. The children had a lot of fun and the breakfast was great. I will choose the State Guest House next time.

Transportation: Convenient transportation in the city center to nearby shopping malls and shopping centers.
Facilities: The room does not require an electricity card, which is smart and energy-saving, just as the hotel promotes the concept of environmental protection. The room card is made of wood and looks good. The room is clean and tidy. It is a French-style hotel worth checking in. The breakfast is also great. I love their baked eggs.
Service: From the concierge at the entrance to the front desk and the guest room restaurant, they all greeted us enthusiastically in French. The room arrangement and welcome fruit are very unique. I contacted the front desk Kevin before check-in to arrange the room in advance. I felt the cordial service during my stay. I will come back and recommend it to friends next time.

msg:The chance of encountering a bad hotel is still very low throughout the year, but this time has to be counted as one!
1. It takes two elevators to park your car and go back to the room, which is laborious.
2. The toilet is very small, and the three doors of the toilet, bathroom and the entire restroom are always fighting. When you enter the restroom, you have to open and close the doors endlessly to deal with the relationship between these doors. It's annoying.
3. The floor tiles are very slippery, and wearing hotel slippers is even more slippery. Add to that the doors of the toilet, and don't slip and hit the door when you urinate at night. In order not to slip, lay a lot of bath towels, but the consequence of laying bath towels is that the three doors can't be opened, which is annoying!
4. At breakfast time, the staff was indifferent. I wanted to ask him for a children's dining chair, but he said directly that there was no one. Well, with this attitude, I can only walk around the restaurant and drag two back. Sofitel's service is really good!
5. The clear soup in breakfast is salty and sweet. The staff told the staff that this taste is because the red beans used are too salty. The staff said that this is the taste of boiling red beans and sprinkling salt. What is it actually? The red beans used in the qingbuliang and salad are semi-finished products with high saltiness, but the kitchen is too lazy to adjust the taste for you when it is used in desserts, resulting in the qingbuliang being sweet and salty inexplicably! The first reaction of the service staff at Sofitel is always "no" and "you don't understand", and they will come to you first. The service is really bad.

The so-called newest luxury hotel in Haikou, stayed for two nights, the facilities and services are really disappointing!

msg:I can finally understand the "difference" between this so-called five-star hotel and other five-star hotels:
1. Payment and charges. The Ctrip channel showed that payment must be made offline (I have no objection, because it is cheaper), but the room fee was 850 yuan/room. Before I checked in, I was directly asked to pay various deposits and room charges in total (2700 yuan/room). Ctrip deducts 850 for guarantee, the hotel requires 1,000 for deposit, and 850 for room payment! ! Please think twice.
2. Proof of payment. I added the hotel WeChat and sent a screenshot of the payment process to the other party (including the payment invoice number and payment card last number as well as remarks). I was told that if it didn't work, I would need proof of payment through the WeChat channel. It’s really funny. The screenshot of my bank card contains my card number, payment amount, name, mobile phone number and remarks. Why doesn’t it work?
3. Check-out deposit time and feedback. I paid the deposit, so why didn't I ask if a deposit slip was issued? I asked several questions about the refund of the deposit before replying, and was informed that the refund would take 1-3 working days.
 Considering other similar hotels, maybe theirs is special. I don’t recommend you to pay offline, and you won’t stay here again.

msg:Service:
1. This is what I want to say the most. The service of Sofitel Haikou is the worst among all the luxury hotels I have been to. In the morning, when I went to eat buffet, there was a middle-aged and elderly person next to me who said that there were no pickles (in the hot pot area). The staff inside did not raise his hand and nodded and said to the other party: Bring it over and serve it. At that time, the guest was stunned for a moment and hesitated to reach out, but he may have realized that this made him uncomfortable and immediately put the pickle bowl on the table.
2. My child broke the soap box when taking a bath, and I went to the front desk to communicate in the morning. The front desk lady on duty that day did not ask me how my child was and whether anyone had scratched it. Instead, she immediately said to me: I will discuss with the guest room whether I need to pay compensation, and then told me that a soap lid needs to be compensated for 99.03 yuan. Compensation is right, but it is the first time I have seen that the guest’s mood is ignored. Later that morning when I checked out, I confirmed with the front desk at that time. This time the front desk was very good and asked about the child’s injury.
3. I asked the guest room to change the pillow. There were two extra pillows in the original room. I felt it was too messy, so I wanted the guest room staff to take away the original two pillows when changing the pillows. In the end, she told me that I couldn't take it away and had to leave it in the guest room or I would be criticized. I want to ask what the reason is? The guests felt that there were too many pillows in the room (there were six in total but we were only two adults and a child) so why couldn't they take them away?

However, the reception staff at the door performed well, and the boys were very good! The service was thoughtful, warm and polite.
But I will definitely not stay at Sofitel next time I come to Haikou.

In addition, there is an automatic sensor light when you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, and there is a thermometer in the room, which is very good. The breakfast is very good, rich in variety, worthy of a five-star hotel. The waiters at the door are also very enthusiastic and proactive. They will greet you warmly and help with luggage every time you return to the hotel. It is true that the lobby on the 35th floor is a bit subversive to the habitual thinking of ordinary residents (people are used to the lobby being downstairs), but other aspects are very good, and I will give priority to Sofitel next time I come.

I really like the hotel's Baoluo fans. Breakfast time is also relatively late at 10:30. The hotel has a strategic location, next to the Hilton and very close to Wanlv Garden. It is only about 2 kilometers to the International Trade Center and about 4 kilometers to the Riyue Plaza, which is very convenient. The hotel has two indoor and outdoor swimming pools, which are very friendly to friends who like swimming and fitness. The hotel service is also great. Thank you Eve for your considerate service.

msg:Due to personal preference, I have never stayed at a Sofitel hotel before. This time I was extremely disappointed with Haikou Marriott and Haikou Hilton, so I had to give it a try. Unexpectedly, I fell in love!
      Sofitel Haikou vividly expresses the romantic and art-loving spirit of the French, which is refreshing.

facility:
      Very new, much newer and better than the Hilton next door.
      The overall design of the hotel feels refreshing and artistic, and you feel happy from the moment you move in. (It doesn’t smell like musty, cigarette or other odors like the Hilton next door. I got an air purifier that probably hasn’t had its filter replaced in ten years🤬)
       Technology + Art:
       For example, lighting fixtures: bedside chandeliers, table lamps, and ceiling lamps have different shapes but are harmonious and unified.
       This is the first time I have seen such a beautiful and delicate safe. There is a circle of ambient lighting under the bathtub. Maybe it’s because I have never seen the world before, haha.
       The most amazing thing is that the toilet can also listen to music, it is a Villeroy & Boch brand 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
        The wooden furniture is all exquisitely edged with stainless steel, which not only looks good, but also reflects the cleanliness of the room.
      Sofitel understands women and loves women. The simple dressing table and the large round dressing chair make the mood beautiful and double the happiness.

health:
      The light-colored room and the readily accessible stainless steel materials undoubtedly reflect the extremely high hygiene standards of the room.

environment:
      The area is lively, with various restaurants within a few hundred meters.

Serve:
       Because the waiter did not adjust the faucet properly when cleaning, the water in the bathtub leaked all over the floor. The bespectacled duty manager (forgot his name) took it very seriously and immediately sent staff to check and clean, and immediately changed rooms. This attitude and speed must be praised! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

FOOD:
      This time I passed by and stayed for one night. I only experienced breakfast, which was beyond expectations. There was freshly squeezed juice (breakfast should be standard in five hotels in the country, but it was not available at the Haikou Marriott, Haikou Hilton, and Sanya Raffles during this trip to Hainan). Freshly squeezed juice, so I’m very impressed), so I’ll give it a special mention.

      Will stay here again if I have the chance to visit Haikou

Thank you very much for the trouble (／_＼). I am also quite picky. I always check the room when I go out to stay in a hotel. Fortunately, the room is large and has all the facilities.

msg:It was my first time to come to Haikou. I originally booked a hotel based on reviews that said it was very good. However, just half a month after it opened, I felt dizzy and nauseous when I entered the room. The hotel negotiated a refund. The temperature in Haikou has cooled down in the past few days. I can imagine the kind of people who drag their suitcases and children around the streets looking for hotels at 21 o'clock in the evening. I came to this hotel with the mentality of giving it a try. The guy at the front desk was very attentive. I checked in at 21:15 pm on December 26, 2023. I asked him if this was the city center? He told me it was Haikou’s CBD. I felt relieved. Really, those who comment on the Internet, hope they can write their true feelings, okay? Don't write unrealistic information for small gains. At night, if you have a need, the guest room will be immediately provided. There are eight types of pillows to choose from. Breakfast has both Chinese and Western styles, with many varieties. Thanks to the front desk guy and the night shift lady from Henan who gave me a blanket and a sheet at 1:30 in the morning. Their professionalism was very good. She was also very happy to share with me the local people's solutions to the weather changes in the past few days. Thank you for the warmth you brought me in this strange city.

The mini bar in the previous hotel was free, but it turns out that there is a charge here. I didn't look carefully, so I spent 55 yuan. Box of beef cubes, 12 cans of coconut milk ~ This food is too cost-effective. The hotel is positioned as a business hotel, so the swimming pool is 1.4, which is not suitable for children. Of course, it does not come with swimming rings. Welcome fruit is given when you check in, and the service is quite attentive ~ Geography The location is more convenient.

Then there is the fresh and nutritious breakfast, with a rich variety of Western food and fruit and vegetable drinks, which brings a feeling of surprise to the guests, starting a full day with a steaming breakfast. I am very satisfied with my stay. Finally, I would like to thank Sofitel Ambassador Miradda for her considerate reception and phone call. Thank you very much.

msg:The experience of checking in was very good from the beginning. The doorman was very attentive every time I came in and out. Every time I came in with large and small bags, he would deliver them to my room.
You can call to have water delivered to your door every day, and you can call to have a bath brought to you. Cleaning is also very polite.
The room has a lot of advanced automation. The toilet will automatically open its lid and emit light at night (the color of the light can be selected by yourself)
The weather forecast says that all lights will be turned off at night, but it will not turn off the lights. Remember to call and ask for duty-free coupons yourself, and I will not give them to you proactively.
Breakfast was okay. The refreshing fruit was available on the first day, but not available on the second day. On the third day, it was simply left out.
On the last day of my stay, the housekeeper added me because I wanted a coupon, and asked for a good review. You can't just write a good review, they edited it and copied it for you.
Oh, by the way, a deposit of 5,000 yuan was charged for a three-day stay. I didn't receive the deposit back on the day of check-out. One day later, I asked the housekeeper again, but they blocked me because I refused to give a good review.
Yesterday they were still very enthusiastic about the after-sales service. If you are not satisfied, you can report it. I couldn’t find the child’s belongings, but I have to write a positive review and the hotel will follow up... I followed up very carefully and blocked them.
Let me check in often in the future, and I will be given welcome fruits. I am really happy.
In addition, you need to change to the elevator three times to get to your room, and ordering takeout can only be delivered to the first floor. This is a hotel with a very high threshold.
To sum it up in one sentence, I ate a very delicious bowl of noodles and found a fly in the soup base... Now I feel really tight in my chest, so I will give you a honest review.

The flight was delayed and we arrived at the hotel at 12 o'clock in the morning, catching up with the beautiful lady Regina on duty. Thank you Regina, you saved my day! I was upgraded to a super large room of 65 square meters. The bed is very comfortable. The temperature of the hot tub can be controlled and raised to very hot. It is so comfortable. I particularly like this triangular workbench. The French design inspiration is really great. It doesn’t take up space. When you sit down from every angle, you feel like you are the center of the universe. Thank you Sofitel for making my trip to Haikou more exciting! I will bring my family and children to stay here next time.

msg:The lobby is on the 35th floor. When you get off the bus, a bellman will come over to help you with your luggage. Because there were guests in front of us when we checked in, we waited for a while and then hurriedly apologized to us and gave the child breakfast (the child was nine years old). When checking in, the waiter brought welcome fruits and small cakes, which made the children very happy. The executive lounge is also very quiet. I went there to sit in the evening and specially prepared hot milk for the children. However, the elevator is not convenient to go to the room. You must go to the lobby on the 35th floor and then take another elevator to go to the guest room. Another point is that all the switch buttons in the room are controlled by LED touch screens and cannot be turned off, making it very bright when sleeping at night. This is a bit unfriendly to people with high sleep requirements and will make them prone to insomnia. Overall, it's pretty good in all aspects.

It can be said to be a very satisfactory hotel. I say this hotel is outstanding because it is always easy to distinguish hotel grades in Hainan by looking at the air conditioning. Fresh and dry air is the quality that guests most need from a hotel. Excellent hotel bathrooms are dry immediately after use, and this is exactly the advantage this hotel has. The swimming pool is a pleasant temperature and the water is clear. The black chicken feet for breakfast were amazing. The juice was freshly squeezed without adding water. I drank pear juice and pineapple juice. The quality was so good. The rest of the place was average, but the beef and chicken were hard and dry, and the toilet spray didn't work.

But the biggest and biggest shortcoming is that the sound insulation is really really bad.
The sound insulation in the room is very good, there is no sound from the window, air conditioner, and toilet exhaust fan. But there is almost no sound insulation between rooms and between rooms and doorways.
One night, I was woken up n times by the sound of residents coming and going and closing the door of the room on the same floor, and I could hear people passing by and talking at the door. The head of the bed in the next room is probably separated by a wall from ours, and we could hear her cell phone vibrating non-stop. In the end, we had to move to the end of the bed to sleep. Really broken.
It is really important for a hotel to provide a quiet resting environment, and I hope the sound insulation can be improved.

First off, the location of the Sofitel is ideal. Zhongshan Road, located in the center of Haikou, has convenience and characteristics in terms of geographical location. It is very close to the bustling business district and tourist attractions, and the surrounding shopping centers and restaurants can be reached on foot, which allows me to enjoy the food and shopping in Haikou to the fullest during my short stay.

After entering the hotel, I was attracted by its decoration and a**osphere. The lobby is spacious and bright, with simple yet luxurious design, giving people a feeling of being at home. The staff at the front desk are kind and friendly, they give me a warm reception, and can communicate in English fluently, providing me with valuable travel advice and services.

I chose the deluxe room as my accommodation choice. The space layout and decoration of the room are very elegant, giving people a sense of comfort and elegance. The bed is soft and comfortable, well-equipped, especially the light design is very comfortable, giving people a relaxing environment. The room is also equipped with a convenient multi-function electronic control panel, which can meet various needs and is very convenient.

Sofitel's dining options are also very rich and varied. The breakfast buffet restaurant provides a variety of food, from Chinese to Western dishes, with a wide variety and delicious taste. Other restaurants also provide high-quality food choices, whether it is local specialties or international cuisine, it will not disappoint.

Finally, I would like to give my biggest compliments to the service team at Sofitel. From check-in to check-out, the staff showed a professional, enthusiastic and thoughtful service attitude. Whether it's the restaurant or room service, I was very flattered that the staff always went out of their way to meet my needs and always had a smile on their face.

In this experience of staying at Sofitel Haikou, I got more comfort and satisfaction than expected. Whether it is the hotel's location, luxurious facilities and decoration, or the quality of service and food, Sofitel has given me an unforgettable travel experience. If you plan to go to Haikou, I strongly recommend Sofitel, it will bring you unparalleled enjoyment during your stay.

Since the bathroom is made of transparent glass, the red light of the toilet is always on all night... All in all, the room is still bright when the light is turned off. If you like people who can only fall asleep in the dark, don't choose Sofitel .
Many new hotel switches are like this now, and they are really not as good as traditional switches.

Stay in the room on the 31st floor to see the sea view and the city view with a wide view, which is pleasing to the eye. The smart toilet was a surprise, it was great. There was a problem with the room on the night of check-in. The manager Xiao Wang at the front desk resolved it in time and was satisfied. When Xiao Wang learned about our flight time tomorrow, he thoughtfully delayed the check-out time. It was so heartwarming, thank you.
The female staff at the noodle stalls in the breakfast restaurant on the 34th floor provide good service and are responsive to requests.
In short, staying at Sofitel Haikou this time marks a successful end to our trip to Hainan.

msg:The layout of the hotel is really incomprehensible. In the lobby on the first floor, there is no sign indicating that the front desk is on the 35th floor. One elevator to the front desk, after checking in, change the elevator to the room, and then go to the parking lot to change again. It's too hot and I don't want to eat in the hotel or go out. The takeaway I ordered can only be placed in the lobby on the first floor, and no one can help deliver it. Now many express hotels have robots that can deliver. The room service is really not up to standard. It takes a long time to deliver ice cubes and red wine glasses. The service staff don't have an overall sense of five-star service and are very casual. I will not compare it with the resort hotels in Haitang Bay, even the Renaissance. The variety and quality of breakfast are really average... The only thing worthy of recognition is the location of the hotel and the view of the restaurant.

We like Haikou’s bustling nightlife, so the location of the hotel is very important. The first time I came to Haikou, I chose Shangri-La and Hilton. I didn’t give a review because I didn’t choose this time. The Sofitel Hotel next to Hilton has indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and you can walk to Shangbang Parkway City in a ten-minute drive. The most considerate thing is that Cynthia, who has not yet left the hotel, contacted me to ask about various needs and The result was quickly replied, until we got off the plane and contacted me in time to tell me that all aspects of the room were ready and waiting for us to check in. Sophia was very heartwarming and gave a small gift until we left. She was very thoughtful and thoughtful service. There is also Shirley in the administrative corridor. Because there were not many customers when we went, she enthusiastically served us and prepared all kinds of food and drinks and asked about our needs. Finally, she recommended us a small restaurant that locals would eat, which is economical and delicious. I was very happy to meet two people In the end, we took our luggage and left. The three concierge sisters helped us with our luggage and sent us to the car. The overall itinerary was very good 👍🏿 The experience was very good👍🏿

The room card had not been demagnetized. When I entered the elevator, I couldn’t swipe the room card on the 27th floor. I didn’t think much about it and thought it was a problem with the room card sensor in the elevator. Unexpectedly, my family came back after drinking at 11:30 in the evening and asked a friend to help me press the elevator button. They pressed the button directly to the 29th floor and swiped the room card to enter directly. Room. The guests on the 29th floor and us were all shocked. I have never encountered such a situation before. It is conceivable that the guests on the 29th floor must have been quite frightened. Second, in room 2703, you will hear a heavy door closing or the door panel banging every 15-20 minutes. I couldn't sleep well all night, I suggest you check the reason.
Apart from the location and sea view, this stay experience can be said to be very bad.

The location, the corresponding business district, this time it’s not a business trip, but a family trip requires more. It’s okay to talk about one night for business. It’s really difficult to choose a hotel for a family trip. I originally chose Westin or Hilton. Look at Ctrip’s evaluation I came to Sofitel Hotel and said it was the best. I was tempted and booked a room directly. Advantages: the lobby is on the 35th floor with a great view. The room doesn’t feel so gorgeous when you enter the door, but the more you stay, the more you feel. The hardware is super good, the water The pressure, water temperature, and bathing experience are all very good! The doll likes to watch TV while taking a bath. The one-click atomized glass in the bathroom is very convenient. The water to drink is also very special. The environmentally friendly packaging does not waste, and the taste is good! Breakfast is also ok!
Disadvantages: The service is really unflattering. I have stayed in many hotels, and I don’t know why the attitude of the front desk of this hotel is colder than the other. Why? Is there any sense of superiority? I was upset when I checked in. After 2 o'clock, I checked in at 4.30 and waited for 2.30 hours. There are many people during this time, so I will give you a high floor as much as possible and you will be done! Bringing 2 children, one of them was sleepy and tired, alas, this feeling is really uncomfortable. The men in the foyer on the first floor, for us, were very enthusiastic about picking up and dropping off the luggage when they got off the car. Why did this happen when we reached the 35th floor? Also, the pillows were uncomfortable, and I didn’t sleep well all night. One was very low and the other was very hard. It was only in the morning that I found a pillow menu. There are eight pillows to choose from. I will show you the picture above and contact the guest room in advance. I hope you don’t feel uncomfortable all night like me! I took pictures for your reference! The hardware is really good! The service is really weak. It is a burden to call the front desk every time. I am afraid that people will be impatient! Called 4 times and answered 2 times! The swimming pool on the fifth floor is great!
The location is 8 minutes away from Vientiane City, and 9 minutes away from Yundong Library. You can go shopping when you go out of the hotel. Apart from the service, the hardware is really good!

The breakfast is rich, and there are many local specialties in Haikou, Qingbuliang, Hainan noodles, etc. There was a small episode, the child accidentally broke the plate, the hotel lobby manager Helen helped solve the problem in time, thank you very much 🙏

msg:Before checking in, I compared it with Hilton, Shangri-La, etc., because Sofitel has not been open for a long time, and it is more convenient to go to Holiday Beach and the city, so I finally chose Sofitel. The biggest feature is that the lobby is on the 35th floor. When you check in, you can upgrade from a sea view king bed room to a sea view city view king bed room, an additional 400 yuan. Generally speaking, the hotel facilities are very new and highly intelligent; the view is wide, and you can have a panoramic view of the sea and the city; the bathroom supplies are very good.

Watching the Spring Festival Gala is very refreshing. The complimentary afternoon tea and Spring Festival gifts are also very good.
The only shortcoming is that the room does not have dry and wet separation, and there is no shelter for taking a bath.
It is suggested that the restaurant waiters can be more proactive, such as saying hello
Belts and such.

I enjoyed the SPA very much. The ladies and sisters still behaved professionally during the Chinese New Year and did not fool around.
I especially recommend everyone to come and live!

msg:I have been to at least 7 to 80 cities at home and abroad, and I have stayed in many high-end hotels, and I never write any reviews. Many times I think that is what your star hotel should do, but this time it is voluntary I want to comment. Since this trip is approaching the Chinese New Year, I chose Feihaikou to drive around the island in Sanya, and then I booked this hotel. The experience is really good. In fact, it should be said that it is a super cost-effective hotel. In terms of hardware, the hotel It has its own indoor heated swimming pool and outdoor swimming pool, spa, self-service, executive lounge, humanities, from the time you drive to the lobby on the first floor, you will take the initiative everywhere, greet you with a smile everywhere, and say hello to you (add here, I saw it on the Internet before) The welcome guy on the first floor is very indifferent. I want to explain here that it’s really not that they are indifferent, but that you just need to smile and nod. Because after all, there are really other merchants on the first floor, so I’ll show my heart to you. It’s you, you know Are you a customer staying at the hotel, looking at the car, or shopping?) When I checked in at the front desk, I met Xiao Huang in the executive lounge (the nameplate at the front desk is called Shirley). From check-in, to introducing the hotel in detail, She was very careful and patient when I upgraded the room, and asked some other questions later. She didn't forget to recommend local food and good places to visit. Thank you very much for helping me with my luggage. Kai must also be well received. After delivering the luggage, he explained the room for me. Haha, it turns out that their hotel still has a lot of little ideas and details that I don’t know. Since the hotel lobby needs to be transferred, I have entered and exited 3 or 4 times in the middle, and I have met other waiters on the road who are very good, but I did not record their names. I have also been to the swimming pool twice, one in the morning, and when it was close to closing. I went to stay for about 2 hours. Although the water is very shallow, the ambulancemen have been sitting on a high place and watching silently. This feeling is really good. This time it was really a pleasant stay. I will definitely choose this hotel next time I travel. It really makes people feel that they care about the guests everywhere.

msg:Summary: A hotel that nobody cares about. When we brought up the attitude of the front desk service manager, he told us that we didn't want to stay and asked us to contact the third party to check out. What's even more ridiculous is that after waiting for an hour to check in, there were melon seed skins all over the carpet in the room, all kinds of hair on the telephone carpet, the cups in the breakfast room, the tableware was very dirty, and there were guests arguing in the restaurant, and there was no leadership. Is this a luxury hotel?
1. Arrived at the store at 3:00 in the morning, and entered the room at 4:00. Only one of the two people at the front desk was checking in. We had 3 rooms in total, and after waiting for 20 minutes for the remaining 2 rooms, we proposed that another person could help us. When checking in, the duty manager named Alisa didn't even raise her head. She was very impatient and only said 3 words, ID card, like a person who owed money. After we didn't say anything and gave him the ID card, we said very bluntly who is staying? After we raised the issue of her attitude, she was still very tough and asked the guests who hadn't checked into the room at 34 o'clock in the middle of the night to say that if you don't want to stay, you can contact the third room to check out.
2. After upgrading the room, there are melon seeds scattered on the carpet of the room. . There was cleansing oil on the dressing table, two hairs floating on the landline, and long and short hairs on the carpet.
3. The manager who dealt with the matter the next day said that he would invite us to lunch, but we refused to accept it because we had to leave in a hurry. We said you can see how to solve these problems. After half an hour, she did not contact us again. After going downstairs to find her, there was still no solution, and told us that we could only treat you to lunch. . Said that she is the biggest in the hotel, and no other leader can handle this matter. It means that if you don't eat, you can check out and leave.
When we entered the breakfast room, we could hear the staff arguing with the guests. When we entered, there was no one to show us a seat, no one to verify the information, let alone set the tableware, and more than two guests reported that the tableware was dirty. The dirty glass of a luxury hotel is not as good as that of a roadside Chinese restaurant.
In short, this is a hotel with no one and no leader. It is best to pray that you will not encounter these things when you stay, otherwise you will have nowhere to complain, and you will suffer if you are angry. We have stayed here more than 6 times, and there have been some problems before, but we are still willing to choose to live after they are properly resolved, so now we have complained before and feel that our guests are looking for trouble, so we don't want to deal with it? Then I trouble you to do your own thing first, we don't have so much leisure to pick your thorns. I am worthy of my job, my salary, and whether I am suitable for the service industry. When I first lived in it, I gave it a good review. Now it seems really ridiculous. If I don’t want to open it, I can close the shop.

msg:1. The housekeeper was lukewarm before check-in, and the response to information was very slow, and the service response time after check-in was also very long. Never take the initiative to provide services, you have to take the initiative to find her.
2. After checking in, I suddenly said that because I have been in Qiong for less than three days, I can't go to the restaurant to eat, and I can only deliver it to the room. The key is that the optional meals are very monotonous, just some egg snacks and vegetables, and the afternoon tea is also very simple. I had breakfast and afternoon tea in three days. The executive lounge is like a fake. I don't know what this suite is for. Other hotels can pass through their own hotel, but his house can't.
3. I stayed in the Sofitel Suite for three days. The toiletries are the same as in ordinary rooms. There is no Hermes. The welcome fruit is also very simple, only a piece of cake and a few oranges.
4. I won't say much about the takeaway issue, many people have already mentioned it. It can only be placed on the first floor, and it is very troublesome to transfer to the elevator on the 35th floor to go downstairs.

In short, the overall feeling of staying this time is that I lived in a lonely place, with no food, no scenery, no service. I won't live here again in the future, and I don't recommend others to live here, especially for the ten thousand friends who have just joined Qiong. Now it has been changed to Langham next door.

msg:Stayed in Haikou for a week and stayed in three hotels. Sofitel is the best and most satisfactory one. The check-in experience is very good. From the lobby manager to the front desk to the bellboy, the service attitude is very good. This is the equipment that a five-star should have. They are also very newly renovated and at first glance, they also invited designers to choose Sofitel when they come to Haikou! !

msg:As long as there is a sea in your heart, Maldives is everywhere. What's more, Sofitel itself is close to the sea.
Drinking freshly ground coffee, in the curling aroma, overlooking the center of Haikou and the sea not far away, the tall coconut trees turn into rows of cute little ones, blocking the hot sun for the rushing crowd, 32nd floor In the air-conditioned room, the blue sky and white clouds in Haikou looked like a Hayao Miyazaki cartoon.
The excellent vision has made people feel tired, happy, satisfied, contented, and grateful for the quietness in these years.
Different hotel brands have different temperaments and personalities, I like Sofitel's. A casual sophistication and elegance, a bit of a lazy romance, is thoughtful and relaxed. A bit like Shu Qi, bright and comfortable. Shu Qi is not perfect, and neither is Sofitel. But there is a kind of style that blows at the face and makes people irresistible. Behind this is the self-management and requirements of painstaking efforts, which have made me a little bit.
Before the epidemic, I liked Sofitel's cafeteria very much, and I like to choose here for dinner parties. In good conscience, when the catering market has been so bleak in recent years, Sofitel's buffet is very sincere, much better than the surrounding restaurants of the same level. It's just that sometimes the restaurant management is a little rambling and a little disorganized.
The gym is quite small, but the swimming pool is great. There are two inside and outside. When there are few people, one person has one pool, especially at night, when floating in the swimming pool and the stars are full of stars, one person can be so romantic.
When a friend comes to visit, she must be staying at Sofitel. Miss Jiajia, a little beauty who has never met before in the reservation depar**ent at the front desk, I know she has a beautiful voice just by listening to her voice. Help me to write down my demands in detail. In WeChat, they implemented every matter to me as soon as possible. It can be said that they are well-intentioned, professional and dedicated, and they must be greatly praised.
I have never commented on Sofitel. Today, I will write a long article to express my feelings. I hope it will get better and better, we are all.

Since I haven't stayed in a hotel of the Accor Group for a long time, this stay is still quite emotional!
Two days before check-in, Eve from the hotel sales depar**ent called me to ask and take care of me. When I left the airport, it was nucleic acid and antigen, and I had to scan the code on the road. It took me a long time to arrive at the hotel at 17:30. The front desk Cynthia warmly received me. Helped me check in in the room, and then met Grace, who was very elegant, in the Executive Club Club. The little girl helped me make a glass of Fruit Punch, which was very delicious.
The overall feeling is that the service is very in place and from the inside out, not the kind of blunt enthusiasm, the hotel hardware facilities are good, and it can be seen that it has spent a lot of money.
However, the style of the decoration is white and cold, with Hermes orange, more intelligent, less user-friendly, and the WI-FI is extremely poor. Breakfast and catering in the administrative building are weak and need to be improved.
In short, this is a hotel with services greater than hardware, so I feel deeply!

msg:After booking two days of accommodation, I realized that Sofitel service is really speechless, Accor hotels are so unbearable.
Living in so many hotels, this is the first time I have encountered such a speechless thing.
On the first day of check-in, I parked my car in the temporary parking area and checked in first, holding my child and luggage, but the security guard actually drove me away. These are our leading parking spaces, you can't park here.
I saw that there are so many leaders of Sofitel. There are more than ten cars parked here, but there is no room for customers to stop.
Come back the next day, stop the car, the security guards ignore it and drive you away while talking on the phone. I parked so many cars in the front and back, but they didn't let me stop, just because I didn't drive a luxury car today?
I said in-house guests, I stopped the car.
Sofitel is really a big name, and the security guards are so good. Where do you live, show me the room card.
This fires me.
I stopped there, and the security guard actually called someone, feeling like they were going to beat me up.
I went to complain, no feedback, no results, nothing more.
Accor Hotel is so awesome, it's awesome, I give you a thumbs up.

This time I booked an executive floor in Haikou, and the experience was very good. The hotel is very new, the lobby is on the 35th floor, the room is arranged to see the sea, and the concierge brother helps to deliver the luggage to the room. Check-in at the front desk is fast, and the room facilities are advanced. Because I brought a baby, I arranged a crib and baby supplies. Prepare more towels and drinking water every day. Room service is also on call. The executive lounge is quiet and has a good view. Shirley and Sabrina were also very considerate. They came to the lounge on the first day, and the lounge went to the Chinese restaurant to borrow a baby chair. On the second day, we came back to the lounge and the baby chair was still there because they carefully noticed that I was staying for three days. , so have been staying in the lounge we used. It is the most attentive one I have walked through so many hotels. When I come to Haikou, I will choose Sofitel, and I will also enter the pit of Accor.

We also happened to catch the sunset in Haikou~ However, I felt that the sound insulation was not good, and maybe the children next door were too noisy...

If you take your kids to the swimming pool, it will be close to a private pool. The water temperature is moderate. It is recommended to add a dryer... Afternoon tea on the 33rd floor is very pleasant☕️

Episode 1: When I entered the room, I saw the pool that had not been cleaned yet and was being unclogged... (I won’t post the photo... we understand each other during the peak season) Episode 2: The restroom for the spa massage, 🚽 still maintained the condition that the previous guest had not rinsed and thrown away.

The front desk of the hotel is on the 35th floor, and there is no receptionist downstairs. It is difficult to find it from the underground garage. If there is a lot of luggage, it is more troublesome, you have to carry it all by yourself, there is no luggage cart, and no personnel will help you. From the ba*****t to the hotel, you need to transfer the elevator twice. After check-in, going from the garage to the room, it is very inconvenient to transfer the elevator three times (three times in a building). The service staff is also very indifferent. The hotel has breakfast on several floors, and there are swimming pools on several floors. The spa will not tell you. I once thought that there was no one, and there was only one room to live in. I still saw it by myself. We called the service desk and asked for the children's slippers, but they were not delivered within 20 minutes, so we called the service center to inform the service center that we were going out. Hotel toiletries are also cheap. Anyway, this price, regardless of service, environment, hardware, accessories can not match. The price/performance ratio is really not high, and I will not choose it in the future.

msg:A few reasons for the bad review.
1 The hotel has a good view. Great view of the sea from the lobby
2. The front desk service of the hotel is very good, but the security service on the downstairs floor is very poor. When you come up, you are a brother. Who is your brother?
3 rooms have problems with hygiene and hardware. The bath water is not hot, contact the front desk to quickly solve it for me. The light bulb is broken, and it is flickering Figure 3
Figure 1 The sofa has the mark of going upstairs and downstairs.

As a five-star hotel, the scenery hardware is passable
However, service, decoration and hardware standards are subject to consideration

Strongly do not recommend everyone to live

msg:Why are other hotels of the same level 4.7, and Sofitel 4.8? This 0.1 point difference is not white high. You only know when you feel it. The brands used in the in-room facilities can be understood by those who are pursuing the quality of life. As small as the kettle sound, as large as the bathtub toilet, everyone understands it! Why use such high-end brand facilities in such a cheap room? I have only seen this grade in a hotel of three to five thousand one nights. I went around to Hilton and went to Langham, which is really incomparable. Currently in the Langham, my husband is still talking about the Sofitel is much better haha. To be honest, my hotel rarely gives good reviews, almost no reviews. When I came to Sanya and Haikou, I stayed in basically all good hotels. There are more than a dozen luxury hotels. I only gave praise to this place and Sanya Mandarin Oriental. I am really satisfied.

msg:Now it is the no.1 price in Haikou, and it is at least the top 2 in Haikou as a whole after staying there (as well as Langting).
Advantages: 1. The location is really good. The Pinfang Square on the first floor is beautifully built. There are two similar Qingqing Lamoda Roses next to it, right? It should be that Haikou has a more tasteful place to have a drink. It is very comfortable to sit and very beautiful.
2. The swimming pool inside and outside the hotel is very stylish, and the overall decoration is modern and high-end
3. The hardware of the room is good, and the bathroom and tabletop are of good brand and good materials
4. The breakfast is very delicious! Milkshakes, porridge, etc. are all good

Disadvantages: 1. The hair dryer is inductive, and the power is cut off several times when you blow your hair.
2. The sound insulation of the room is average; the response of the smart home is slow
3. Service indifference

Impressed, I was lucky to choose this hotel, the service is also great, the swimming pool is also very good, the shampoo, shower gel, body lotion, etc. taste so good, I don't know where to buy it! Hope to find it. A little flaw is that one of the water plugs in the double basins on the countertop cannot be opened. Fortunately, the other one is easy to use, so I didn't tell the hotel that I want to improve it. Staying here makes us very happy. Thanks!

msg:The hotel management is very good, the front desk is professional and polite, and the problem-solving efficiency is very high. Haikou stayed for a few days and changed to different hotels. It may be because the competition of the hotels here is very sufficient, so the high-end hotels are well managed.

The weather in Haikou is a bit cold during the Chinese New Year, but the water in the indoor swimming pool of the hotel is very warm, and there is a jacuzzi with a relatively high water temperature for children to play with. I took children to play in the evening and in the morning.

The room equipment is well used, the room design has a strong sense, and the bedding is also very comfortable, but some designs are a little less practical. This makes it easy for water to leak outside.

The hotel breakfast is not bad, there is a small bowl of noodles that is delicious. Some of the seats are by the window with a very magnificent view of the bay in the morning.

msg:Objective review. I have been in Hainan for two months and have stayed in many hotels, from luxury hotels in Sanya to four- and five-star hotels in Haikou, Qionghai, Wenchang and Dongfang. The concierge and sanitary environment of this Sofitel Hotel are okay. The so-called newly opened intelligent facilities are very average, not exaggerated, and the bathing and facility brands are not amazing. The above are the standards for a newly opened hotel of this level, right? I'm going to complain about the problem. I came from Langham and deliberately experienced two nights. When I checked in, I was asked to pay extra to change to a sea view. So the so-called sea view is the one I took in the lobby in Figure 6. So if you have requirements for a sea view, don't upgrade and waste money. In addition, the breakfast is a mess. There are so many people that there is no place to queue. There are not many meals to eat. There are many cheap foods (Figures 7 and 8). The hotel's toiletries and drinking water have long been downgraded compared to when it opened. Friends who are interested can go and check it out. Then I found that there are no trash cans in the public area of ​​this hotel. The first floor is just the public area of ​​the office building. There is no rest area. If you want to get to the guest room, you need to change elevators twice. First, you have to go to the lobby and then change elevators to go to the room. In addition, the hotel is completely non-smoking. If you want to smoke, the so-called attraction area of ​​the hotel is the main entrance on the first floor. I was unlucky and caught it on a rainy day. It was cold recently. It was only 13℃ during the day. I had to go to the door to smoke every day. The key is that this door does not shelter from the rain. After smoking, my body and hair were wet (Figures 3 and 4). The next day, I called the front desk to ask if the smoking area written in the hotel facilities is only the main entrance? I was told that it was only the main entrance. I asked if I could smoke on the terrace upstairs? The answer was that it was not open yet. I asked if I could smoke when I went there to consume? Because the weather was bad, I thought that if I could smoke, I would dine in the hotel at night, which would be convenient. The reply was that it was not possible. I later contacted Ctrip customer service to report the information. Ctrip quickly pulled the hotel customer service in the group. I gave Ctrip customer service a thumbs up for this. However, the hotel customer service was just muddling through and speaking official language, feeling like a robot. Later, when I went upstairs, the hotel called, but I didn’t answer. When I got to the front desk, the hotel staff communicated with me about this issue and told me that smoking was allowed in the terrace bar upstairs. I told them that it was no longer important. After that, the hotel never paid any attention to me again... Then I was curious. The statements were inconsistent. Either the hotel staff was unprofessional, or they were afraid that I would not consume. White* Terrace smoking area? I have been to Langham’s Tang Court for dinner. Can the price of your terrace bar in Haikou exceed it? So after these two nights, I did not hesitate to switch to my membership hotel, the Hilton across the street, and enjoy the treatment I deserve. Accor Group hotels have a bad impression of Novotel abroad, and I also have no good impression of the two places I stayed in China. They are only cheap and listed as four-star. The service and humanization of the newly opened Sofitel are not up to par. It's a mess. So I plan to blacklist the Accor Group (One more thing to add, the membership does not need points for this two-night stay)

Because the page parameters were wrong, I changed to a big room and added a small bed for us for free. There are outdoor and indoor swimming pools. The weather in Haikou is suitable for indoors. There is also a small pool with a higher temperature. Children like it very much! You don't want to go when you swim! Overall, it's good and worth a stay!
The only downside is the breakfast, the variety could be increased. Adding children's breakfast, the charges are not uniform, and the attitude to explain the problem is not very good! The first and second days of scanning the code are 58, the third day is 84, and the fourth day is bought on the public account, and the price is 58. Did not understand the explanation of their price difference! It is said that they charge 84, so why did they charge 58 two days ago? Although the money is not much, I hope to improve it, and the price is clearly marked!

msg:I booked a deluxe room in your hotel for two nights from January 12th to 14th. The unit price is 1088 per night, and the total price is 2176. On the 12th, I arrived at the hotel and checked in at the front desk at around 2 noon. Are you going to the sea?" Answered "I can't see it". After inquiring, I learned that the difference between the deluxe room and the deluxe room is that you can see the sea. The size and facilities of the two rooms are basically the same. The Ctrip membership price is deluxe 1008. The price of luxury was 1088 earlier, and the price of luxury was in the early 1200s. On the 12th, the price of the luxury seemed to be around 1245. From the time I paid attention to your hotel in early January to the day I stayed on the 12th, the highest price of the luxury was around 1275, said The details are because a very strange thing happened later, so we continue to talk. After confirming with the front desk that Zunshang can see the sea, I asked, "Can I upgrade the room for free?" The answer was "No" (because the price difference between the two room types is not big, and the size and facilities are the same, I asked casually, no It doesn't matter if you can, it's love, not duty) I asked again, "How much is the difference?" The answer was "300 yuan." I thought about my two-night deluxe price of 2176, plus 300 yuan to 2476 divided by 2 is equal to 1238 yuan per night, which is similar to the price of No. 12 Premium on Ctrip. It is my first time to Haikou, and I am full of curiosity and goodwill about this city. If it is different, please ask the front desk to arrange a room with a better orientation and view, and confirm the check-in. The front desk said that the two-night accommodation fee and the deposit will be charged a total of 4,000 yuan. At that time, there was still an inquiry about the relevant facilities of the hotel at the front desk, and the front desk also took the initiative to write the functions. Give me the regional distribution, and then take the card and leave, thank you here. In summary, all the above are true, and I am willing to take legal responsibility for any falsehoods. Everything is still normal here. I first arrived at your place, and I left early and returned late to visit the beautiful scenery. The information shows that the account is 1224 yuan..? At that time, it was a little strange that 4,000 yuan minus 2,476 should be 1,524. Why is there only 1,224? Thinking that such a big company should not make a mistake, then I started to make up my mind. Could it be that the room upgrade fee told by the front desk is 300 per night? A total of 600 yuan for two nights, this number and the refund match the number. But the logic doesn't work. According to this algorithm, the respected house price will reach 1388, which is 2776 yuan for two nights. During this period of time, it shows that this room type has never reached this price, and the highest is less than 1280. When the front desk placed the order, it did not say to confirm with me that the total difference was 600 yuan. I stayed for two nights, and the check-in procedure was also done by two nights, inertia. Thinking understands that 300 yuan is the cost of all the difference, and you come to a single calculation? Still calculate a price that has never been 1388 yuan, what is the difference to make up for? What's your idea of deduction? I called your store at noon on the 15th, and told the receptionist about this matter. You said that someone will contact me. No one has contacted me until today on the 16th. Speaking of which, I was charged an extra 300 yuan. In the matter of money, you and I are not bad for this amount of money, but this is a matter of attitude. You should give as much as you should, and why do you deduct what you should not deduct? Before checking into your store, I also went to Ctrip to read the reviews. Generally speaking, the service is good. There are no bright spots in the service. I also saw some guests describe the problem of the deposit being difficult to return. After the epidemic, we cannot go abroad. We wander around the country for more than 100 days every year, and we live in various B&Bs and hotels. This time, the last stop of the Sanya trip will be in Haikou. This method has also brought a wonderful thing. It can be regarded as adding some color and insight to our journey, expanding our cognition, and continuing to thank your store. Here, I also kindly remind friends that you need to be cautious when you check in, after all, there are too many routines ( Pay the picture, the room price on the 12th day is no longer available, the screenshot of the room price on the 15th is for reference) I'm so much nagging, sorry 🤝

In the lobby, I met Sabrina who used to be on the executive floor
I didn't notice it was her. I was inquiring about breakfast in another room. A certain waiter at the front desk probably told me that Sabrina heard my voice and came over to help me find a breakfast coupon in a submenu of the official account.

To be honest, this stay experience is actually deducting points, a lot of details. Maybe, the hotel business is good, not too concerned about the old guests~~~
However, because Sabrina and Eve. on the first floor gave me a lot of comfort

msg:The administrative courtesy that I paid for did not provide me with any convenience. When I got off the bus, the doorman saw that he did not come to help with the luggage. The driver helped to lift it down. When I came in, the staff at the concierge on the first floor was in a hurry to say a series of words and even We were sent to the elevator without listening to what was said. No one told us where the exclusive check-in on the executive floor was, and we had to wait in line to check in. I opened the door with anticipation, and saw that the room assigned to me was facing a building, the table was empty, and there was no even the most basic welcome fruit. If the hotel's occupancy rate is too high that day, there is really no way to arrange it, then I don't say it. Of course, the afternoon tea in the executive lounge is good, and the staff can also replenish the food in time, which is commendable. In addition, I could smell the smell coming up from the sewer when I fell asleep at night. I didn't want to be disturbed during my stay, so I didn't ask the staff to deal with it immediately. I closed the bathroom door, and I could barely sleep. I hope it can be rectified in time. During my stay, I didn't feel the service, it was like staying in an express hotel, paying for afternoon tea, packing my bags and going home.

msg:Due to work needs, I once again moved into Sofitel Haikou with my family. Due to the adjus**ent of the work plan, the originally scheduled check-in in the afternoon was postponed to 11 o’clock in the evening. I still met the enthusiastic Bera. The hotel arranged the room for us in advance. Fences and baby beds are arranged. It should be said that this hotel in Haikou is the most satisfactory one I have stayed in, and I will always choose Sofitel!

msg:Very poor experience, the bathroom drain is blocked, and one-third of the Jinshan bathroom is soaked in the bath water. I called the service staff for half an hour and came here already at 1:30 in the morning, say oh? Would you like to change your room? I barely dried the toilet and bathroom water, but the bathroom still slipped the next day. Check out does not ask how your experience is. There is no five-star service standard. Oh, by the way, there is nothing to eat for breakfast.

msg:Currently in Haikou, it's pretty good. It's quite modern and smart, and the service is good. I stayed here for a week without changing hotels. Except for the slight regret that I can't see the sea view, everything else is pretty good. The breakfast is also good. It's pretty good, but the variety is a little less. I really like the self-service refreshment, which is great👍!
Just in time for Chris**as, there is a big Chris**as tree on the first floor, which is very beautiful!

msg:🔔Service: The services at the front desk and the executive lounge are very good. Luke at the concierge helps to store luggage and send off guests. The confirmation before check-in and the return visit after check-in are all done by the switchboard Xiao Wang, who has a serious understanding of the guests Demand and listen to opinions.
🍃Environment: It can be seen that it is a relatively new hotel, clean and tidy, there is an electric toilet, the room accessories are LANVIN, the sound is Bose, and the quality can be seen. However, there will be some back smell in the toilet at night, but not during the day. I don't know why.
😋Dining: I have only experienced breakfast, the variety is quite rich, the coffee is good, and the Hainan characteristic refreshing and refreshing.

msg:The service locations are great. Adjacent to Wanlv Park ~ the boy named waiter. (Photo 1) Seeing the old man waiting for the car to quickly accompany him to take things and open the door. Add color to the impression of the hotel. The first choice next time in Haikou is still here. The best thing is the stylish design of the hotel. Fully electronic central control lights and curtains. Special sense

First of all, I want to thank Xiaohui from the service center. We left a green down jacket when we left room 3112 on December 12. I am really surprised and touched. Thank you for the management of the hotel. It is worthy of being a five-star hotel. The breakfast is also very rich, the room is large, especially the toilet facilities are in place, the smart toilet, smart light source and smart curtains are very comfortable! Will definitely choose to stay in Haikou in the future

msg:The service at Sofitel Haikou is warm and courteous. The location of the hotel is very good, it is convenient to travel, and the environment is beautiful, and you can overlook the scenery of Haikou Harbour. Moreover, the hotel implements a non-smoking policy, which is very friendly to customers like me who mind the smell of smoke!

msg:I was pleasantly surprised after checking in. The Chris**as tree in the lobby is very attractive. The lobby is very high and has a good view. I had breakfast while looking at the beautiful sea view. I was in a good mood all day. Both the staff and guests in the hotel are all beautiful ladies. Brother, I feel like this place is full of fashionable men and women from Haikou😄Executive Lounge Sabrina’s team has very good service. Because my husband is a foreigner, he couldn’t buy train tickets on his mobile phone. They enthusiastically contacted the ticket office of the train station to help us coordinate, and we finally succeeded. Thank you very much for buying the ticket 🙏

msg:Overall it's good. The executive lounge manager Sabrina and her team are very professional and enthusiastic. The afternoon tea in the lounge is also very good. But I want to make a suggestion. The canned toiletries in the room are not easy to use. It is not easy to press and will spray on the body when pressed.

msg:Choosing between Hilton, Langham and Sofitel, I finally decided on Sofitel, probably because the hotel is relatively new and the location is not much different.
1. Because the hotel is still very new, the hygiene is pretty good. The facilities are also relatively new and the toilet seat function is relatively strong. But the room is so big and empty that you can hear the echo clearly even if you sneeze. The sound insulation is not good, you can hear the children playing outside the door and the voices in the next room.
2. The service attitude at the front desk is very good. I followed the introduction and spent 180 to upgrade to a room with a view of the sea. However, I can only see a little of the sea. Can it be considered a sea view room? ! Isn’t this deception? And there is no care kit in the bathroom. Did you not have it or did you forget to put it there? !
3. The hotel lobby is on the 35th floor, and the 34th floor is a restaurant, which is similar to a vegetable market. It is very noisy and affects the good environment of the hotel. The Chris**as tree is being made on the first floor, and when it is finished it still looks like a half-finished product.
Overall, it's pretty good despite its flaws.
