msg:Overall, the hotel is charming, and has a very good point in it's food and beverage service, breakfast is great, and Dinner options too. The location is great, close to the beach and to the forest Park. Sadly the only weakness is the Staff, mostly not english speaking, and sometimes not very reactive on problem solving. As many Say, the interior is a bit old, but clean, comfy, and very well designed. We have been upgrade for the last night to the Villa, which is really the true gem of the hotel.

The breakfast buffet had a nice selection of western food, they had nice variety of breads, croissants, cheese, salami, eggs, etc.. and had a nice coffee machine to make lattes and expresso. The beach is just across the street and only takes a few minutes to walk over. The staff was very nice and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.

The next day again I had a "do not disturb" sign but was out. I did not need cleaning. When I came back to the room, the room was cleaned.

I don't understand what's the point of these signs when the roomkeepers do not bother about it? It's an invasion of privacy.

After a several-year break due to covid it was VERY nice coming back to a place that was familiar and enjoying my time in the water each day and night.

I was happy to see that breakfast hours have been made longer.. it was always tough to get up sometimes to be at breakfast by 9am.. and now - - i had until 11am and that was NICE!

Dinner... needs some variety! my first year staying here each night had a different specialty . . . now its the same food , same food, over and over and over.....

let's get back to the variety and entice your residents to stay for dinner.. i went out each night after trying it the first night and being told it was the same.


See you again next summer! ;-)

We rarely stay at 5* resorts but we had such a great holiday in Sanya we thought this would make a phenomenal end to a fantastic vacation. We wanted our kids to have a memory for a life time so we booked a 2 bedroom villa with a private pool.

A few things didn‚Äôt go to plan and this was not the hotels fault. Our villa was left in the most disgusting state by the previous customers and the cleaning crew had a mammoth task to sort it out. It wasn‚Äôt ready even after 1.5 hours post check in time so the assistant manager offered us 2 x 1 bedroom villas next to each other. While this was a kind gesture it immediately changed our one night stay as we couldn‚Äôt enjoy the villa together. She also offered us a complimentary dinner that night.

Some of the villas are a little run down with lighting needing fixing or taps needing replacing. Overall we felt that for the amount of money we paid we didn‚Äôt feel the luxury or the calm we were aiming for.

All being said the assistant manager was kind, courteous and generous. We were able to have a very late check out and were compensated for our troubles.

msg:Reading previous reviews helped. There was indeed a restaurant, with some western options (3, sirloin steak, lamb leg and lamb (unknown part,nice though)).
When we checked into our villa, the villa was quirky, an odd layout, this isn't a complaint. One sun lounger between 2 people. Dirty towels. This was quickly remedied with a phone call to the front desk and the speedy service of house keeping. However, given the cost these things should not of been encountered.
A lovely staff member by the name of Gary was always willing to help. He spoke tremendous English. The rest of the staff were reluctant. We,as foreigners, experience this nearly on a daily basis. 
This looks like a list of complaints. It certainly isn't. The Pullman offered us our privacy, helped where they can. And the delivery options available were good. The cost of anything,outside of delivery was on the steep side. 
Unfortunately for the Pullman we had just stayed in a place that was more suitable and responsible,when it came to cost, cost of food, drink etc.
It is worth a stay for a couple of nights. We have had our experience and left with smiles. So it can't be that bad.

Edward (Hotel Manager) was excellent to make our stay very pleasant. We were upgraded with our friends to probably the largest villa on the premises, with a massive pool!!! Our kids loved every moment! I definitely recommend a villa when going, they all have private pools, definitely worth it. You can rent inflatables which will be delivered to your villa. There‚Äôs also a game room with a full size snooker table, chess area and table tennis on site. There‚Äôs also a communal pool with a broken slide, not worth it if you‚Äôre in a villa. About 10min walk from the beach but there is a shuttle every 30min. A few nice restaurants about 250m away. Great place and would go again if we had the opportunity.

Pretty annoying when the water stopped coming out of the taps at 8pm when our kid needed to have s shower and go to bed. Overall, it was okay but I wouldn‚Äôt stay here again.

This is a hotel that certainly was a top one, but the time and the amount of not fixed details are making it, regretfully, be a 3 star one. The staff is just nice but does not interact much with guests. The price of the room seems too high for the number of things to be fixed.
The access to one of the swimming pool is awful!! 
This is not Pullman standard!! Lots of work to do to make the Pullman experience be seen in this hotel.

Sadly, maintenance is kept to a minimum (the villas have overgrown shrubbery and grass [the latter even creeping into the swimming pool!] that would really require very little effort to trim, and the buildings have broken panels and tiles; more importantly, the swimming pools are not cleaned‚Ä¶ I found a dead frog, decomposed, in ours).

The restaurant has very limited choices at breakfast and at lunch. The quality of the ingredients is much lower than other similarly rated hotels in the area (we moved around). 

The staff was courteous and friendly, and we were able to communicate via WeChat. 

All and all, I would rate down the hotel by two stars. It really does not compare to other 5 star hotels in Sanya.

We where a little unlucky with the weather so the pictures are not the best. There where not much guests in Sanya because of the pandemic situation so the manager who was very generous upgraded us to a villa. The hotel has very good breakfast with eggs, bacon pancakes, cereal etc.. It is not located directly by the sea so you have to walk maybe 10 min. But it is definitely worth a stay.

The pool water was slimey and felt awful so we couldn't use it. They sent people to fix it three times or so. Never improved, so another amenity gone. Food was terrible. Most edible food at the buffet dinner (paid for) was the chicken nuggets. This was supposed to be our luxury stay and it ended up being just an overpriced bed. Waste of money. The bar was laughably awful. Bartenders struggled to make our drinks when we ordered gin and tonics. Gave us the wrong drinks four times and at one point they insisted the wrong drinks were correct. Only redeeming quality was the nice reception woman and the buggy that picked us up from our room to take us to the front. They offered a new room after we unpacked, but with only a two night stay and a busy schedule there wasn't time to switch. Would not trust a Pullman stay again, especially with great hotels next door.

It‚Äôs close to the beach and there‚Äôs a shuttle bus to there from the hotel. Breakfast was ok but was the same thing everyday basically. We enjoyed our time there but the one thing stopping us from coming back was the smell in the lift and in the ballroom where you eat breakfast. Honestly it‚Äôs awful and smelt like a swamp, I didn‚Äôt go to breakfast some days because of this. We also ordered the afternoon tea and the cakes that came tasted like this swamp smell. Hopefully they can spruce it up a bit and get rid of the smell and then everything else is fine for what you pay.

The breakfast was okay. Not with as many western options as we had thought there would be. 

The Family room - 2 bedroom didn't have a curtain to separate the bathroom area as shown in the photo, so the only way to get total privacy is having everyone in the second bedroom. 

The location has no direct beach access, but all one has to do is walk for less than 10 minutes to reach a beach entrance. 

Very nice Thai Vietnamese restaurant, grocery store, other eateries less than 10 minutes walking. There are even more eating and drinking options if you walk about 20 minutes. 

The customer service shone through when I called because I left an item of clothing in our closet. At my request, they sent it to my next hotel which I really appreciated a lot.

A couple of negatives only: we visited 6 months ago and their slide wasn't working, it still hasn't been fixed. This is sad, surely it doesn't take that much to fix a slide? Also the pools are lovely and deep and therefore chilly in winter, which is fine, what we didn't understand is why you don't heat the Sky Jacuzzi? These are just little things though that don't detract from one's stay.
Overall, if your are ok not being on the beach front and are looking for a quieter place that really makes the effort to help you, then I would recommend the Pullman. We will definitely be back!!

Very responsive and customer-oriented personnel. Upon check-in, we complained that the Jacuzzi does not work and the pool is not fully filled. This remark was very quickly eliminated. A rich buffet breakfast, a good selection of Chinese and Western cuisine. For example, a wonderful selection of cheeses: Gouda, Cheddar, Danish blue, Brie and so on. A huge selection of seafood: crabs, oysters, shrimps, various types of shellfish. We were lucky enough to participate in a festive Halloween dinner. The event was organized at the highest level. Firstly, the design and decoration of the hall and costumes of the staff in a traditional festive style. Secondly, the festive dishes were simply delicious: Chef W.K. Andy personally treated the guests with beef Wellington signature dish. Desserts and sweets were served in the style of the holiday. We were surrounded by attention, warmth and care of the staff of the restaurant hall. We want to say many thanks to the work of Candy, Jeff, Laura, Lisa.  Sheila at the reception desk. That was a real pleasure to stay at Pullman Yalong Bay Resort and SPA Hotel and we recommend this place to everyone!

They just told me through translator which way should I go! Even you never been at the hotel and have no idea which way to go! So I insist that stuff must to show me my room number. Breakfast is nice, most of the food is western style. Other things was good. The pool is great and view is amazing. Housekeeping service is also very good

msg:We spent a wonderful 8 days at this magical hotel in August 2021.  Already approaching the hotel, we realized that we were in some incredible place.  The landscape and architecture are impressive.  Everything is very clean and well maintained.  You can see how the staff takes care of everything.  We were placed in a family room with access to the pool and it was a very pleasant surprise for us.  The staff are very polite. The breakfast at the hotel is very good with a wide variety of food.  There is also European and Chinese cuisine, a lot of delicious pastries and fruits.  There are freshly squeezed juices and cheeses, which is important for foreigners.  It is very convenient that the staff speaks English.  You can eat in the restaurant at other time, except for breakfast.  Mostly there are European dishes.  Now only one restaurant is functioning, but this does not cause any inconvenience for guests. 
Rooms were cleaned daily with towels changed.  For 8 days of stay, bed linen was changed 3-4 times.
The hotel has several swimming pools, but during our stay only one was open.  But that was enough.  The pool is very clean and large and works late.
The hotel is a 7-minute walk from the beach.  There is a small bus from the hotel to the beach every half hour.  But we really enjoyed walking through the grounds of the Marriott hotel.  It's fast, convenient and beautiful).  The beach is very clean and seaweed-free.
We are delighted that we have chosen this lovely hotel for our holiday.  We want to come here again and recommend it for everyone to visit‚ù§Ô∏è

msg:We spent a week at Pullman and had mixed feelings about it. However, the overall impression was rather pleasant and we enjoyed our time. 
Here are some pros and cons.
1. The villa: + it was spacious, comfortable to live in, surrounded by trees and flowers; the bathroom was big and had a big tub with jets; the pool was nice and big; - the villa indeed is a bit old, the best word to describe it would be ‚Äúrustic‚Äù; the privacy of it is not ideal as our entire pool could be viewed from the outside in two different places; the jets in the tub were gross and a ton of dirt came out when we turned them on, we had to fill the tub with water, run the jets and drain it around 5 or 6 times until the jets stopped spitting out dirt; pool got a bit too dirty by the end of our stay, we weren‚Äôt sure if there was any filtration going on, the only maintenance it had was someone coming to drop in more chlorine once; 
2. The restaurant + had tables outside, the breakfast food was fine; - the main restaurant isn‚Äôt that big, so the tables are quite close one to another, the restaurant was full every morning of our stay, no matter how early we came; the dinner buffet was quite bad especially for it‚Äôs price, can‚Äôt recommend it to anyone, the food was very over cooked, and it was mostly Chinese style steamed seafood (even though they call it ‚ÄúEuropean food festival‚Äù).
3. The staff was mostly great, the housekeeping and the front desk were super friendly and efficient. The restaurant staff wasn‚Äôt too careful, perhaps mostly due to their extreme workload. 

Overall, we enjoyed the time by the private pool, it was serene and quiet. All the problems I mentioned above weren‚Äôt crucial and didn‚Äôt affect our stay much (maybe except for the dinner buffet). I can recommend this hotel to those who don‚Äôt like public pools and beaches, and want to have a quiet and (somewhat) private holiday. If you prefer staying at the beach all day, or enjoy cocktails by a big pool, maybe it‚Äôs better to choose a different hotel.

msg:Worth every penny. Fabulous hotel with great pools, clean rooms, and lovely staff.  Breakfast buffet had a variety of both Chinese and Western cuisines, all of which were yummy. Some friends booked the villa, and thoroughly enjoyed their stay too. English level of the staff wasn't an issue, as there tended to be someone on staff who they could refer any enquiries to if you ordered water or a towel or something from your room. 
If you walk directly across the road and through the Marriott (3-5 mins) you reach a lovely stretch of beach - sun lounges are free to use and you don't have to get there super early to secure one either. 

They did have a slightly weird payment method though. Essentially, you pay the entire amount for the stay on trip.com, then upon arrival, you pay the entire amount again at the reception desk. Then within a day of checkout, trip.com refunds you your initial payment in full. Not sure why, it's just their policy.

However, the location is not ideal if you want to go to the beach (the hotel has no facilities at the beach, and the other hotels won't let you stay at their facilities) and the cleanliness of the rooms can be improved. Finally, because the villas are immersed in the vegetation, there will be a lot of insects around.

During our stay, half of the hotel were under renovation so the main pool and several restaurants were closed. 
The hotel is not beachfront but beach is walking distance though, like 5-10 minutes, if needed hotel provides shuttle to the beach every 30 minutes.
The villa we stayed was a bit old but yet cozy. We had problems with the jacuzzi and the lights from the spare room which were broken, we asked the hotel to fix it but they never did. However we asked to swap the hairdryer and they did.

Special thanks to Mike for making sure my stay was going great and to all the team for being so attentive! The furniture at the villa is a bit outdated but space is big and definetely worth it when you consider you get your own private pool, jacuzzi and great service!

There are golf cars to move you around from your villa to the lobby and to the beach. Yalong Bay beach is only 8 min walk from the lobby, beach was empty and the hotel has their own palapas, there is a mini mart on the way to the beach so you can buy beers, wine and snacks there. 

Thank you guys!

As a long-established five-star hotel in Yalong Bay, Pullman has excellent service. All kinds of needs can be responded to in a timely manner by dialing 0, such as calling for sightseeing buses, drinking water, disposable bathtub masks, cleaning rooms... The response is very quick.
I am very satisfied with the butler service. Service manager Zhang Nan added WeChat one day in advance. Because there are many requirements for the elderly and children, they are actively connected and met one by one. The room inspection is also arranged very carefully; the buffet dinner, floating afternoon tea, spa and other things booked in the hotel are all arranged properly.

Environment:
It is full of Southeast Asian style and I like it very much. Because the baby is small, I didn‚Äôt go to the small Southeast Asian scenes around the main building to take pictures, which is a bit regrettable.

Hardware:
Although it is an old hotel, the hardware does have some traces of time in some places, but it also has a unique flavor.
The Nanyang villa I booked has been upgraded to the Myanmar villa, which has good privacy and is very convenient to enter and exit the swimming pool from the room. The large bathtub is suitable for small-month-old babies to swim.

Other products:
The spa of 298 per hour is very cost-effective
The overall hotel‚Äôs catering consumption price is relatively beautiful, and there are various group purchases

The most satisfactory hotel this time is Pullman Villa Resort Hotel. To be honest, it is still comfortable and free to live in the villa! The feeling of laziness on vacation is full!
The staff are very warm and gentle, and the housekeeper is very professional and responsive.
The 24-hour shuttle bus brothers at the door are very friendly and sunny!
The front desk staff is also smiling! The restaurant service manager has a good attitude. I think the hotel has good personnel management.

I stayed in a 270-square-meter Thai-style villa, which is large and comfortable. The private swimming pool is very clean. The baby swam several times and was very happy. The bedding is also relatively comfortable and the overall cleanness is very good.

The whole hotel is designed in Thai style. I didn‚Äôt take pictures of the building area because I took a photo. Thanks to the tropical rainforest vegetation in the villa and public areas, it is very beautiful! There are many big trees that I can‚Äôt name, with thick branches and trunks, which should be a few years old.
6:00-7:00 am Take the kids for a walk in the hotel garden. It's amazing. The air is first-class, the tropical plants are full of life, the birds are chirping, and the little ants are busy! It's really great to take the kids to recognize small insects and plants! It's a mini rain forest, enough for the kids.

First of all, the hardware is indeed as the online comments say, there are old problems, and it can be seen that it has been maintained, but the Southeast Asian style wooden decoration is indeed difficult to maintain. Fortunately, the sanitation is done carefully and seriously, and the staff Ma Ruilan has a super good service attitude, giving people a warm welcome and responding to guests' requests in a timely manner.
I have been to Yalong Bay many times. This is the first time I stayed in a villa room. It is convenient for children to swim and has good privacy. There is a shuttle bus to the lobby and the large swimming pool or to get takeout. It is very fast and convenient. The large swimming pool is very beautiful for taking pictures.
The most important thing is that the air conditioning in the room is powerful, and a dehumidifier is provided upon request, so there is no musty smell in the room, and it is also comfortable to rest at night.
It's a pity that I only booked two nights. It is a super cost-effective hotel. I will stay a few more days next time.
The staff only responded to the request and did not let people give good reviews. They speak with strength, which deserves more praise.

If you want a lively, sea view room, don't want to walk, and have a lot of delicious food, then don't choose this one~ You can choose Hilton, Marriott, and Ritz-Carlton opposite, all of which are right by the sea. Pullman Hotel is a 10-minute walk from the beach~ Turn left from the hotel and walk 200 meters across the road. There is a small night market "Dongrong Food Court". It is not big, but you can also eat coconut chicken, seafood and other delicacies. You will pass by this food court when you go to the beach. When you check in at the hotel, there are buses to and from the CDF duty-free shop in Haitang Bay and a 9.5% discount on the duty-free shop. Scan the code at the front desk to make an appointment. Helena upgraded the Thai villa. In fact, there is no difference in size from the Nanyang villa. There may be a little difference in style and a larger area. Because I went there at the end of May, it has been raining for the past few days, but it is still very comfortable in the private pool villa. The hotel is very beautiful, with a view at every step. You can wait for the shuttle bus from the lobby to the room. It is also very good to walk around the hotel and take pictures. The bathtub in the room is very big, and it is very comfortable to take a hot bath.
Let's focus on the service. The room attendants are outstanding. They clean very carefully and fold towels after cleaning. It can be seen that the room staff are trying hard to make up for the lack of facilities with meticulous service. The staff are also shy, but their attitudes are very sincere.

msg:The hotel is quite big, but we barely visited it. Just take a car to the villa when you check in, and take a car to the lobby when you go out. To experience the private pool in the villa, you can try it. Others are so-so. The only feeling is that there are a lot of small animals. Frogs, giant snails. Because there happened to be a typhoon. I woke up with dozens of mosquito bites on my body. There were hundreds of insect corpses in the swimming pool. The scene was so scary that I didn‚Äôt take any pictures.

msg:Because it is off-season, the price is really cost-effective. The location is also excellent, not far from the beach and dining places, and the sea in Yalong Bay is really good, it is the kind of transparent jelly sea.

Facilities: The hotel has indeed been open for a long time, and some items are relatively old, but it does not affect living and use. It is recommended that customers who live in villas like us buy a swimming ring by themselves, and do not rent the boutique in the hotel, which is too expensive and not cost-effective
Hygiene: The sanitation plan is timely and very clean. The room attendant folds different towel dolls every day, and there are small cards written carefully, which are very warm
Service: If there is anything, just call the front desk and it will be solved immediately. Then there is also a housekeeper, but it is better not to have one. When something happens, I will not reply to WeChat for a long time.
Meals: There are many types of breakfast, but I don‚Äôt like it very much. Chinese food is not delicious, but Western bread and desserts are well made. As a result, I ate bread every morning for the last two days. If you order takeout, it will not be delivered to the room. You have to go to the takeout cabinet in the lobby to pick it up, which is not very convenient.

Internet celebrity travel photography and 15-second short videos: If you want to take photos, it is recommended to find a travel photographer directly, and try not to use this. They only give you 10 negatives, and if you want to retouch, you have to pay extra. The price is not cheap, and you have to do your own makeup, etc., which is not cost-effective. It is recommended to negotiate the price and package directly with the travel photographer, at least you can choose to let them do your makeup, without having to do it yourself.

The service staff were very polite and would take the initiative to greet the guests. The breakfast was rich and the dinner had a seafood hot pot and barbecue buffet, which tasted good. The hotel is quiet and private, with a beautiful environment, complete facilities, and perfect supporting facilities. The service is in place but not cumbersome. Karen at the front desk was attentive and responsible. During the stay, she added WeChat to provide services, which made the already pleasant experience even better. I can experience different room types on vacation in the future.

The room was cleaned quickly and efficiently, and the beautiful bed flowers were made, which was an unexpected surprise! This time I saw that some areas of the hotel are being renovated.

msg:I come to the Pullman in Yalong Bay, Sanya for vacation almost every year. I can feel that many of the guests staying in the hotel are loyal old customers, and many are repeat customers.
Pullman is not facing the sea, but it is actually very close to the beach. It only takes a few minutes to walk there, but the room price is much more affordable than those hotels with first-line sea views. Moreover, the villa rooms of Pullman are very comfortable and private, which is most suitable for family vacations.
The most attractive thing about Pullman is the service. The greetings of every hotel employee are warm and sincere. Li Hongming, the waiter in the housekeeping depar**ent, gave us a beautiful surprise on the first day. The two elegant swans instantly relieved our fatigue on the road. Thank youÀÜüòäÀÜThere will be different surprises every day after that·ñóüòÉ·ñòSpecial thanks to Qin Guiyun, Lin Shuguang, Duan Jinfeng and Lin Shengqi for their servicesÀÜüòäÀÜ
The breakfast of Pullman is rich and delicious. The waiters in the catering depar**ent are polite and patient in their busyness. Thank youÀÜüòäÀÜ
The dinner in the Chinese restaurant is Hainanese style. The dishes are delicious and delicious. Coconut chicken and tofu are especially recommended.
The coconuts in the hotel are cheaper than those in the market outside and taste good! ’ûüòÉ’û
Finally, thank you to the hotel manager Zhang Nan for his care and concern! Let us experience the warmth of home in Pullman‚ú∫‚óüüòÑ‚óû‚ú∫

msg:Thank you very much for the care of the housekeeper Anne. She contacted us before we checked in and prepared the room for us. The overall experience of staying here is very good. I really don't understand what the people who gave bad reviews are thinking.
The Pullman Villa series is indeed more suitable for: people who like nature (the environment is too good, and there will definitely be some flying insects in the villa), people who like private space (the feeling of independent swimming pool and independent room is great)
Thank you very much for the care of the service staff:
The pick-up guy is very nice, kind, enthusiastic, gentle and hospitable
The guy who cleans the pool: he responds to everything and recommends delicious food, drinks and fun things to us
The front desk lady/housekeeper: responds very quickly and provides 24-hour service
In short, I am really grateful to the hotel for giving us a perfect trip (I was really nervous when I saw so many bad reviews when I just booked it) and it's safe to pull out the ****s! Next time I will stay in Pullman again, I love it so much!!!
In addition, the 24-hour photos of this hotel are beautiful, and the photos are very good. Don't miss it if you like taking photos. Once the door is closed, it feels great that no one will disturb you no matter how you take photos!

There was a shuttle bus to the room 24 hours a day, and it was very convenient to go back in the middle of the night. I will stay here again when I go to Sanya in the future!!!

msg:Very satisfied with Pullman Villa Hotel. I feel that Yalong Bay is better than Haitang Bay in all aspects. It is very convenient to travel and play. There are also rich foods. The hotel room is very clean. The area is large. The air conditioning is sufficient. The villa swimming pool is very large. The water quality is good. Circulation filtration. You can call the service staff to disinfect and clean it at any time if necessary. The room service staff is very enthusiastic. They work conscientiously and responsibly. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt remember their names. I only know that it was a lady‚Äôs elder sister and a male service staff. The shuttle bus from the lobby to the villa area was very fast. The service staff was also very good. Introduce various hotel facilities. I checked in from 5.4 to 7. Room 8024. I hope the hotel can praise them after seeing it. Thank you for their enthusiastic service. In addition. The chilled fresh coconuts in the hotel lobby bar are excellent. They are delicious and cheaper than outside. I spin several every day. No need to drink beverages. Hehe.
Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel catering:
The breakfast is relatively rich in variety. Unfortunately, the taste is average. The taste of breakfast noodles is hard to describe. There was no orange juice, and the restaurant chef actually told me that I didn't need to drink the same juice every day. The problem is that mango juice may cause allergies in children.
The dinner buffet hot pot and barbecue were good. The Hainan Island meal for two was light in taste. It is very suitable for those who just go there to try it. Thumbs up.

The hotel is in the Southeast Asian style I like, with a view at every step. The park is very large, and it doesn't seem crowded even on May Day. What made this trip the icing on the cake was the hotel's private butler Yiming Max, who was very considerate. He not only prepared fresh coconuts picked by the hotel that day, but also considered the time difference between my departure time and the train trip, and considered delayed check-out. All the small details made me feel that this was the most fulfilling and comfortable day of May Day. Thank you üôè I will come again next time, hahahaha

msg:1. A family traveled on May 1st, but did not check the guide. I had a good experience staying at Pullman Lijiang in Kaifeng before, so I booked it directly.
2. I called in advance to inform that two children were traveling with me, and booked a Myanmar villa.
3. They arranged a location near the road, which was very noisy at night and the children could not sleep well.
4. There were no children's products, such as children's pillows, children's toys, and so on.
5. There were hairs in the swimming pool, white rope residues from the lifebuoy, leaves, and black sand and mud underneath
6. The indoor switch was broken
7. Old hardware, broken wooden doors, cracked stones, unable to complain
8. There were almost no children's activities, and no notice was given. The water system in the community was a decoration and could not be used
9. The photography was provided, but the service was particularly perfunctory. I took a few photos reluctantly and did not record the video. After giving feedback to the housekeeper, a lady who claimed to be Green Travel Photography came back the next day and asked in a cold tone if there was anything I was dissatisfied with?
10. There were few types of breakfast, and I didn't say it was not delicious. There were too many people and the venue was too small, so the experience was particularly bad.
11. Two days later, I changed to Leeman Sofitel. I booked a full sea view room. The housekeeper directly arranged a high-rise apar**ent, the closest to the sea. He personally sent it to the room from the front desk. Seeing that there were two children, he directly sent a box of Lego blocks and arranged for someone to send a large tent indoors. At night, he also sent a starry sky rotating light when I went out in the afternoon. I also changed children's toothbrushes, children's bathrobes, children's pillows, and children's slippers. The hotel's children's activities were pushed separately every day. Every day, I asked if there were any inappropriate places. At night, I reminded how to mismatch the peak dining time the next day. Platinum travel photography is very serious. The photographer was sweating profusely in the hot weather. He took care of the emotional value throughout the process. The child coaxed me to take videos and photos, and captured as many shots as possible. Finally, I upgraded the album package of thousands of yuan. There are many security guards in the hotel, with slides, swimming equipment, entertainment facilities, and various cakes, handicrafts, bumper cars, and small trains on the underground first floor...
8. Overall, the experience of adults and children in Pullman was very bad in the first two days, wild. Later, I felt like I was on vacation in Sofitel and was taken care of.
9. I would like to mention that the butlers of Pullman are very polite and modest. However, the hotel's facilities, hygiene, management, catering, and culture are not determined by the butlers. As a guest, you cannot say good things against your will just because the butlers have a few smiles.

Finally, there were old water stains on the bathroom glass, which proved that cleaning was often neglected.

msg:The overall style of the hotel is more Southeast Asian. The hotel offers travel photography services, which allow you to take photos at the beach or in the hotel, which is very photogenic. In addition, the hotel offers tickets to the Binlang Valley Scenic Area, which is a good place for children to play. The scenic area is quite mature. We invited a tour guide to explain and arrange the route for us. The whole process was very easy without having to think hard. The independent swimming pool in the villa area is the best experience. After checking in in the afternoon, the children played until dark before going out to find food. The environment in the villa area is comfortable and quiet, which is very suitable for taking children on vacation!

Maybe because it is off-season, the pool view room we booked was upgraded to a villa pool room. It has a large area and an independent swimming pool. I really love it. It is very private, and the shuttle bus is also very convenient. It is not far from the beach. I also like the hotel's breakfast. There are many varieties. Hainan noodles and various small breads are super delicious, and the fruits are also fresh. I especially praise Tang Pinying and Ji Shanzhi from the recreation depar**ent, and the cleaning sister Ma Ruilan. They come here every day to test the water quality. The swimming pool is clean and hygienic, and the room is cleaned in a timely manner. The travel photos sent are also very beautiful, beyond expectations. If I come again, I will stay in this hotel.

The waiters Wenjuan and Wenxia gave us a lot of surprises: the room was specially decorated twice, small swimming rings and unicorn swimming rings were given to the children, and coconuts and roses were also given to usüåπ.
The children's playroom is slightly small, and the activities are suitable for younger children, but the lady teaching there is very gentle and patient with the children.
Internet celebrity travel photos and 15-second short videos: Travel photos are a bit useless, so don‚Äôt have high expectations. Just ask passers-by to help you take photos of your level and quality. You‚Äôll need to pay extra for selecting more photos, and you‚Äôll also need to refine them. The hotel itself is nice.

msg:I have been to Sanya three times. The first two times were for business trips. I wanted to stay at Pullman last time but failed. This time I finally got to stay!
The off-season when office workers don‚Äôt have long vacations and children don‚Äôt have summer vacations is so cheap. I cried. The hotel was built a little older and the facilities are a little older, but they are still very useful. The main thing is that the service is really impeccable. The housekeeper added me on WeChat on the night of check-in on the 5th. On the 6th, she gave us two coconuts and said that if there is anything in the next few days, you can always contact her. We were woken up by the crying child in the next room at 8 or 9 on the 7th (actually, there was nothing we could do about it. How could the child not cry?). We called the front desk and asked them to communicate. Within ten minutes, the housekeeper contacted me on WeChat and said that we would be upgraded to a villa room for free. I never expected this because we originally planned to stay until the 12th, but the first reservation was only until the 9th. We had to extend our stay after the 9th. I told the housekeeper about the extension and she said it was no problem. After the upgrade, we didn‚Äôt have to move out of the villa and could continue to stay until the 12th. Then the housekeeper kept communicating with me and helped me see which one was more cost-effective, the Ctrip channel price or the hotel official account price. Just for this, I will make a lot of money when I go back and come back next year! Repay Pullman! And their swimming pool is great! The big pool is open one-third but it's still enough for splashing around. There are kids playing in the water and it's not crowded at all (I met a kid on the first day I went swimming and he knew how we climbed onto the flamingo boat we rented)
The small pool in the villa is also great! The water is very clean. If you think there are too many leaves and kapok falling in, you can call the housekeeping at any time to ask the guy to help clean it up
Special thanks to the housekeeper Helena Chen Shanzhu. Although we haven't met, she responded to our needs very promptly. I will definitely come again next time!
Also thank you to Tan Guiyun, Lin Shengqi, Chen Junming, Wang Xiaokou, Li Qiuxi, and Miss Yafei who helped clean the room these days! The little animals you folded are super cute‚ù§Ô∏è (I can't bear to take them apart and put them in the bathtub hahahahahaha)

In short, I praise them from head to toe. I feel sad when I think I'm leaving tomorrowüò´If I didn't have to move bricks when I go back, I would have changed my ticket and stayed for two more days

The hotel is across the road and down the public passage to the beach, which is about a ten-minute walk. The seafood processing in the food court at the door is also very delicious.

It is very cost-effective, and the hotel is also very quiet at night. It is highly recommended to stay!

It's close, very suitable for couples to go on honeymoon or bring the elderly to relax. The most fortunate thing is that we met all the attentive service staff, which allowed us to experience the privacy of the pool villa. The villa area is very elegant and quiet, the shuttle bus is always on call, and the one-stop butler service is very reassuring. I I like this hotel very much and hope to stay here again if I have the opportunity. Thank you again Helena.

The breakfast is rich and the service is attentive. A butler will be contacted and will respond immediately if you need anything. The waiters Zhou Zhou and Jiang Wenjuan are very kind and enthusiastic.

It is very convenient for playing water sports and digging crabs with the children at night. The environment of the hotel is very good and very clean. The service is also very good and all requests are answered (within a reasonable range). There are many coconut trees in the park, covered with coconuts. The hotel happened to pick coconuts during our stay. Helena, the considerate housekeeper, gave us two. The coconut fragrance is very strong and delicious. All the hotel staff are very kind and warm, especially She is the housekeeping lady. She is very warm and polite. She cleans the room very cleanly. I hope that the old hotel can gradually be updated and become better and better.

Some hotel swimming pools are relatively shallow and not very buoyant. The poolside room has a first floor and a second floor. The upper and lower pools are connected. The lower pool on the first floor is rectangular and feels larger, and there are small boats for playing. It is not directly close to the sea. There are Marriott and Hilton across the road. You can go to the seaside through these hotels, or you can take the public access to the sea. The sea passage is very close, and there is a food street next to it. Coconut Chicken and Qiongzhou Dregs and Vinegar are both chain stores and they are delicious. There is a small path on the right side of the hotel lobby leading to the hotel villa area. They are all Thai, Burmese and other Southeast Asian style buildings. The villa has its own swimming pool, and there is a shuttle bus to the hotel lobby and restaurant. Helena, the housekeeper, provided attentive service. The service staff came to clean the room and brought two coconuts to help us delay check-out. Normally, check-out is at 12 o'clock, but we were delayed until the afternoon. Eva's service at the front desk during check-in and check-out was also very attentive. When we heard that we were going to stay in Haitang Bay after checking out, she thoughtfully suggested that we take the duty-free shuttle bus to Haitang Bay. It departs from Pullman at 14:30 and is not crowded. Much, I happened to leave by car after checking out. All in all, it was a pleasant stay, thumbs up.

When it comes to eating, the hotel restaurant Shui Runxuan is more reliable than outside (I‚Äôve been tricked by the seafood market before, so be careful!) and more cost-effective. You must try the Hainanese coconut chicken hotpot!
The hotel is about three to five minutes from the beach, and it is very convenient to just walk there;

Pullman Sanya Yalong Bay should be regarded as a mid-range hotel with excellent value for money. Having stayed at Coral and Mangrove at the same price, I feel it is not as ideal as Pullman. Next time I come to Sanya, I will still choose Pullman first.

It is understandable that it is an old hotel after all, and the environmental sanitation is terrible! I have never stayed in such a dirty hotel. The swimming pool was so murky! Not to mention rich in breakfast, it can't be compared to the most basic three-star hotel. It's quite confusing! It tastes terrible. I ordered it two days before I came here, but luckily I canceled it one day! There was a change in my itinerary, and I communicated with the hotel that I needed to cancel a day, but I was not allowed to refund due to various requests. I was asked to make a new reservation if I could cancel the day, and the price was required to be higher than the total reservation price before. This meant that the price I set for one night was higher than before. The price for two nights is even higher, otherwise we won‚Äôt give you a refund! The service industry is really God, with overbearing terms for forced buying and selling! Fortunately, I took a day off and kept my eyes open! Do not decide, do not decide! Be sure to keep your eyes open when booking a room!

However, the water jet function of the jacuzzi in the Thai-style villa I stayed in did not work. The villa area closest to the lobby and parking lot is the Nanyang Villa (similar to the ordinary suite). The swimming pool is just like a small fish pond for children to play. Behind it is the Myanmar Villa. The swimming pool of the Myanmar Villa is also very small. In the middle of the villa area is the Xinyue Villa. At the end of the club area are the Thai Villa, the Royal Villa, and the Imperial Villaüè°. The swimming pool of the Thai Villa is 15 meters long, 1.3 meters deep, and 6 meters wide (children must be accompanied by an adult to use it). The Thai villa has a dining room and living room, indoor and outdoor showers, a jacuzzi, and a dedicated cloakroom. The room is large and spacious, and the swimming pool can be directly entered from the bedroom, jacuzzi, and shower room. This is very comfortable for couples.
Hygiene: The room is very clean. The housekeeper will come and fold a different animal with a towel every day. This is very good and deserves praise! Some mosquitoes are inevitable in the tropics.
Environment: The villa area is quiet and very private during the day and night. There is no need to worry about privacy leaks. Couples can play as they want when staying in the villa. The swimming pool in the villa cannot be seen outside the villa (except for Nanyang Villa and Myanmar Villa) , slightly less private). The most beautiful plant in the hotel is the elephant foot tree.
Service: There are 80-90 kinds of buffet breakfast, which is 5-star standard. Especially the noodles are delicious. I have to eat a bowl of noodles for breakfast every day when I stay. The Chinese food ordering all has Hainan characteristics, and the per capita consumption is 150 yuan. The room delivery service is very good. A Hainanese chicken set meal of 88 is enough for one person. It also comes with a fruit platter and Laohuo soup. There is almost no one in the hotel lounge, and the coconut water is great for refreshing! Finally, special thanks to the housekeepers Xiao Wang, Xiao Li, etc.üëå

The hotel's living room, bedroom and bathroom are very large, probably about 200 square meters in total. In addition to the private swimming pool, there is also a pavilion with two deck chairs, where you can sit comfortably and watch the scenery.
The hotel has a beautiful environment and rich breakfast varieties. It‚Äôs very suitable to stay in a hotel here! I stayed here for two nights and never left the hotel. In short, I highly recommend this hotel to my friends. For the price of a first-line sea view room in Yalong Bay (for example, choose Mangrove or Hilton), you can stay in a single-family pool villa of more than 200 square meters here. Obviously, the villa hotel is more cost-effective!
One final detail. This waiter folds towels for the room every time after cleaning. It is very cute. The housekeeping lady always smiles brightly and is not impatient with the many requests of guests. Special thanks to the room manager Helena for her service. It is very good. , worth recommending.

If a family lives, you can add a bed to the living room to create a two-bedroom villa. The hotel's landscape is also designed to be very Southeast Asian, which shows the pattern of AccorHotels. We originally booked two nights, but finally decided to extend our stay for three nights. In addition, I am very grateful to the front desk staff Felix for recommending a family villa that is more suitable for our needs when extending our stay.

msg:I was traveling to Sanya with my kids and booked this hotel by chance. I was a little worried after reading the reviews. Unexpectedly, as soon as the reservation was completed, the service manager Zhang Nan called to confirm in detail the arrival time, number of people and the itinerary. Hearing that we were bringing children, they were very considerate and upgraded our room and gave us many travel suggestions. The hotel has a Southeast Asian style, and the staff are very warm and polite. When you walk in the hotel, no matter the cleaning staff, maintenance staff or battery car drivers, they will take the initiative to say hello. The whole stay experience was great, I will choose Pullman next time.

After the upgrade, the room has an independent swimming pool and great privacy. The housekeeper is very considerate and the service is in place. There are many kinds of breakfast. You can sit by the lake and enjoy the beautiful scenery while having breakfast. It is very comfortable. There is no choice in the room. The front desk helped to upgrade it to a Thai-style villa. The area of ‚Äã‚Äãnearly 300 square meters is very surprising. Although the hotel is relatively old, the design and decoration are It is very elegant. You can jump into the swimming pool by opening the door of the bedroom and shower room. The overall environment of the hotel is very green, the design is very unique, and most importantly, it is quiet and you can have a good rest. There is no choice in terms of service. Customer service will contact you in advance, and there is a dedicated WeChat customer service. You can communicate with us about any needs. You no longer have to call the hotel all the time. At Pullman Sanya Yalong Bay Villa Resort, you can experience it without going abroad. The Southeast Asian style is amazing üëç. You can feel the Southeast Asian a**osphere as soon as you enter the hotel. The hotel is especially suitable for vacation. I booked a Nanyang Pool Villa for this trip, which has better privacy. The swimming pool is very clean and has a 24-hour filtering cycle. You can contact the staff at any time. Cleanliness and sanitation are also in place. The ladies who clean the house every day are very enthusiastic and clean. They respect the privacy of guests. The management training of the hotel depar**ent is very professional. There is a gym in the hotel. The buffet is rich in breakfast, dinner and dinner. The park management is also great. Yes, there are many types of green plants in the park, and the pruning is very creative. It is a hotel worth staying in.

msg:After having a baby, I will come to Sanya again. The first stop was Haitang Bay, and the second stop was Yalong Bay. Instead of choosing the Sheraton and Hilton where I had stayed before, I chose the Pullman Villa with its own swimming pool. The hotel has a unique style, South Asian style and exotic style. Although it is close to the swimming pool, the humidity level is acceptable and the air conditioning is powerful. Before checking in, I received a call from the customer service manager Zhang Nan, who informed us in detail about the journey time, check-in arrangements, etc. Manager Zhang Nan also thoughtfully extended our check-out time. The children had some special needs, and Manager Zhang responded quickly. Thank you very much! Looking forward to coming again next time. Photos are attached for your reference.

msg:I had previously booked a hotel on a certain website and was told it would be canceled before departure. My husband temporarily booked a night at the Pullman and set off with some trepidation after seeing some bad reviews. After arriving, it exceeded expectations. Although some facilities were slightly outdated due to the long time and tropical climate, some of the shortcomings did not affect the overall cost-effectiveness at all.
There are sightseeing buses to pick you up and drop off in and out of the villa area 24 hours a day, so you don't have to worry about walking far. The location of the hotel is also very good. There is a food court opposite the back door, and the beach is a 5.6-minute walk from the passage next to the food court. It only costs a few yuan to take a taxi to Baihua Valley and the outlets.
The breakfast is very rich and tastes good. The evening buffet is now on sale at a special price of 138/person. Although there is no Japanese sashimi, the quality control of other dishes is very good. You can taste Hainan specialties such as dregs vinegar, Hainan noodles, and Qingbuliang. . This price is very impressive for the food and beverages in Hainan Island itself.
Because Cindy at the front desk was very warm and considerate, the check-in experience was great, and we were given a room upgrade. We immediately extended our stay for two days without hesitation. I originally wanted to continue staying, but I rushed back because I had an emergency at home. I will still choose Pullman next time I go there‚úî

As soon as I got off the car, I came to get my suitcase and asked if I could check in and brought it to the front desk. The front desk service attitude was also very good and the explanations were very detailed. After staying for the second day, I would like to know if the guest room can be opened directly for cleaning without asking the guest? I also touched my personal belongings, and the mixing bowl I used to apply the facial mask was also lost to me. Actually, this was okay. I went to the front desk to buy cigarettes that night. I told the front desk that I was going to get takeout and asked him to bring it to the front desk for me. I took it upstairs by the way. After getting the takeout, I went back and asked the female receptionist. I don't know why she was so weird, "Can you tell me that it will take time to bring it over?" That tone and expression were really enough. If you can't speak, don't be the front desk person. It was really annoying. I even explained to him that if he brought it, I would take it upstairs, and if he didn't, he would take it upstairs for me! ! Overall, that day was really unpleasant! ! I hope the hotel can provide some training

You can choose pictures immediately after taking the photo. If you only want the 10 free pictures, that‚Äôs fine. The staff will not force you. If you come with your family and want to make rare memories, the package price of 499 is acceptable. If you take more than one photo, an additional 30 yuan will be charged for each photo. There are sunglasses and some flower props in the studio. Some clothes are free, but wedding dresses are charged extra.

I originally booked a pool room with a swimming pool on the door, but I was told that it would be crowded if I added an extra bed, so I changed to a villa room. The villa room has its own swimming pool. Dad I was very excited. I changed my clothes and jumped into the water. But when I went to the public swimming pool, I found that the public swimming pool was still more fun. After all, it was big and spacious. It had paddle boards, glass boats, and flying carpets. You could play until you took off, haha~~ Hotel In fact, there is one big swimming pool, one uphill and one downhill. They are connected, but they may be separated for safety. Then there are two Tianchi, which are just walking up along the same landscape, but these two Tianchi are not big. , travel photography may be okay, but the landscape is a bit old and damaged, and it doesn‚Äôt look good when photographed. Unfortunately, there are also slides and other places that are under maintenance and are not open. It is probably because they are too old. The hotel is generally good. The guest room area, which is mainly villas, is surrounded by gardens with small bridges and flowing water. It is very quiet and has a slight Southeast Asian style. If it is properly maintained, the damaged landscape is repaired, and the swimming pool is repaired, it will feel better. The hotel's breakfast venue and dishes are both good, better than the Chinese restaurant. Don't go to the Shuirunxuan Chinese restaurant. It's on the underground floor. It's dark. The restaurant is very old, the waiters are dull, and the food is hard to describe. , very average, you don‚Äôt need to go.

It‚Äôs very convenient to go to the public swimming pool. Taking photos in the swimming pool is very photogenic. Thank you very much to the front desk. The room Anne arranged for me was great. I decisively decided to extend my stay to experience other room types in the hotel. I highly recommend it because of the cracked wall. If the trip had not ended, I would have chosen to stay a few more nights! üëç

msg:Recommended resort hotels. Hotels in the Yalong Bay area generally have low floors, lush greenery, and villa rooms. Although they were built a long time ago, the Southeast Asian mahogany-colored decoration style is old and timeless. This time I experienced the smallest villa room in Pullman, which also has a swimming pool. It is clean and comfortable, and everything from the facilities to the butler service is just right. You can come here with confidence. After the light rain in the morning, there are four cleaners cleaning fallen leaves on a road, and two cleaners are salvaging leaves from the pond. To this day, Pullman is seriously providing services, which is perfect for people who want to relax and lie down for a few days.

Although there is no beach of your own, just tell the front desk that you want to go to the beach, and the shuttle bus will take you to the designated location.

The slippers in the house are all small and suitable for feet 36-38.
It's great that you can enter the swimming pool directly.
If you‚Äôre not next to the beach, you have to walk there! I saw that other hotels have battery cars that go directly to the beach! I asked the front desk that this hotel does not provide it!
The sea in Yalong Bay is still very beautiful!

msg:We originally booked a pool room, but the front desk upgraded us to a Myanmar villa. Of course we were happy. But later we found that the air conditioner was not cold and the shower faucet was loose, so we asked the front desk to help. We took this time to get a massage. After the massage, we received a WeChat message from the front desk staff saying that there was no problem after checking it, so we went back to the room with peace of mind. Unexpectedly, the faucet was still loose and we couldn't take a shower at all. The front desk said that they would help us change rooms and upgrade to a Thai villa. , but either there was no wifi in the room, or the toilet was leaking. Because it was very late that day, the front desk arranged a room with better air conditioning of the same level, and waited until tomorrow to change to a Thai villa. The next day I changed to a Thai villa and there was a problem with replacing the shower head. AlasüòÆüí® Anyway, the hotel is too old and broken. Even after repairs, it keeps breaking. I suggest that the entire hotel be renovated!

Thank you to the service manager Zhang Nan for upgrading us to a Thai villa and delaying the check-out time ~ the service is very good!
Other service staff in the hotel are very friendly and responsive.
The air conditioning in the villa room is cool and the bathtub is large. Children love the swimming pool and don't want to come out as soon as they get in.

msg:I came to Sanya in early September this year and experienced a total of 5 hotels, namely the Ritz-Carlton Yalong Bay, Pullman Yalong Bay, Fairmont Haitang Bay, Atlantis Haitang Bay and Shangri-La Haitang Bay. Speaking of Pullman, compared to the other four, it can be said to be the most popular one. I will definitely not choose it again next time.
When it comes to choosing Pullman, it‚Äôs because I came to Sanya the summer before last and stayed at the Ritz-Carlton. My mother and I went to the Pullman diagonally across the street for a spa. At that time, a battery car took us from the hotel lobby to the spa center. On the way, I felt that this hotel had a Southeast Asian style, and it was basically all small villas, which I found very interesting. The first stop in Sanya this time was to stay at the Ritz-Carlton for 2 nights, so I planned to try the Pullman for 2 nights behind the Ritz. It was at the end of August that I saw a hotel package (2,699 yuan for two nights in a Thai-style villa, including breakfast for two and a buffet dinner for two). I was attracted by the small independent villa with a swimming pool, so I booked it. The price seems to be a good deal compared to other hotels, but the experience is really bad.
By the way, I would like to give you a reference to the prices of other hotels I booked in the non-peak season in early September. Because this time I am traveling with my parents and three adults, so when booking, I will give priority to suites or larger rooms. The Ritz-Carlton, with an average price of RMB 3,888 per night, Huahaixuan Executive Suite, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã123 square meters, a king-size bed room with a frontal sea view, 1 free extra bed, including executive benefits for 3 adults, 5 meals a day, and airport transfers. Fairmont Jinzun Ocean View Duplex Suite costs an average of 1,975 yuan per night, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã118 square meters. Duplex, with 1 large bed upstairs and downstairs, including breakfast for 4 adults and executive benefits (afternoon tea and simple dinner set menu). Atlantis Club Room (Royal Club twin room includes club benefits for 2 people for 2,959 yuan, an additional 1,800 yuan was added at the front desk check-in to upgrade to the latest Atlantis Club Room), 4,795 yuan 1 Night, including Royal Club treatment for 3 adults (5 meals a day), unlimited access to the aquarium and water world for 3 people. Shangri-La's Haitang Suite costs an average of 1,735 yuan per night, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã112 square meters, 1 free extra bed, including breakfast for 3 adults and Horizon Club executive benefits (afternoon tea and hot food buffet for dinner).
Back to Pullman, there is definitely a gap between checking out of the Ritz-Carlton Executive Suite and Pullman. This is something to be prepared for. After all, the price is there. But as far as the price of Pullman is concerned, I feel that its services, rooms, supplies and other aspects are not up to par. First of all, from the moment I checked in, I felt that the entire front desk was not up to par (later it turned out that the entire hotel service was not up to par, and I felt that the Pullman staff were all confused). I heard that I had a set meal for 2699 including a buffet dinner for two people. The day before yesterday, I was told that the buffet dinner was no longer available and could only be replaced by a set meal at the Chinese restaurant. In fact, I was quite unhappy at the time. The buffet dinner was a highlight when I made the reservation. I changed it immediately. I also asked if it was closed for the past two days. The front desk told me that it had not been open recently. I booked it about a week in advance, but until I checked out, I saw that the package including buffet dinner was still on sale on Ctrip.
After checking in, the battery car took us to our small villa, and here comes the highlight. I have stayed in many hotels over the years, but I have never seen a hotel that allows guests to turn on the air conditioner when they arrive in the room! Imagine that in a place like Sanya, the weather is over 30 degrees in early September. After we arrived in the room, we turned on the air conditioner in the room. It couldn't cool down for half a day, and we were sweating profusely! We can understand that the maintenance cost of a small villa is too high. Is it inconvenient to turn on the air conditioner for guests first? But I have stayed in villa rooms in other hotels before, and to be honest, this is the first time I have encountered them.
Compared to the other Ritz-Carlton, Atlantis and Fairmont hotels I visited on this trip, all of which had their staff contact us via WeChat in advance, Pullman was even more incomparable, with basically zero service. Compared with other hotels in this industry that have welcome fruits, free mini bars, etc., the Pullman doesn't even have any fruits. It stands to reason that compared with the basic rooms of Fairmont and Shangri-La, it is not cheap.
Let‚Äôs talk about the biggest highlight of this trip, the so-called villa with swimming pool. It‚Äôs hard to describe it in words. I live in a slightly larger Thai-style villa (there are also smaller Nanyang villas and Myanmar villas). It is said to have an area of ‚Äã‚Äã270 square meters, but I feel that the design is very unreasonable. There is a so-called living room, a large room separated from the bedroom, with a TV, sofa and a large dining table. There is no independent bathroom, which is very useless. You have to go through the outdoors to get to the bedroom. Let‚Äôs talk about the room. It‚Äôs really too old. I don‚Äôt know if the floor tiles are of that style. They‚Äôre all full of holes.
Let's talk about the public space. I don't know if it is inconsistent with the atmosphere here. It always feels very depressing. Our analysis is that the road here is too narrow and not open.
Finally, for the dining part, breakfast is included for 2 people. We are 3 adults, so we bought breakfast coupons for 1 person each time in the breakfast room. Dianping said it was 68 yuan per person. This breakfast can be said to be very perfunctory in a hotel in Sanya. . Let‚Äôs talk about the set menu we changed from the original buffet dinner. I chose the Western set meal. The main course was a platter of various grilled items. The portion was good, but compared to the original buffet dinner, it was definitely incomparable. What displeased me was that there was a sashimi platter inside. I don‚Äôt know if we were the first table that night, but our salmon sashimi was just a few thin slices, sp****ly placed on ice. But then I saw that the people at the next table had the same set meal as us. They were all thick-cut, rolled and arranged into beautiful shapes. I was too lazy to argue, so I didn‚Äôt say anything. In addition, the fruit platter in the set meal was not served to us, but it was served to the next table. Since I was full too, I didn't bother to say it, but I didn't feel good.
Generally speaking, I don‚Äôt know if it is inconsistent with the aura of Pullman. The overall feeling is that it is stretched, there is no service to speak of, the rooms are old, the public area is depressing, and the catering is not online. Even at this price, I don‚Äôt think it is a good hotel. worth it. This is the most disappointing restaurant on my trip and I won‚Äôt come back next time.

In fact, all the beaches are public, but the deck chairs on the beach belong to a certain hotel, and there are public washing places beside the beach, so there is no delay in playing on the waves! Have a good time at the beach, go back to the hotel for a short rest, continue to swim and play in the private swimming pool of the villa, the children have a great time playing. There are battery cars in the hotel on call to take guests to the lobby or back to their rooms. It is also very comfortable to wander around the hotel when the weather is not hot, small ponds, flowers, birds, fish and insects, tropical style. The service of the hotel is also very good. The housekeepers Cissy and the housekeeper Max are friendly and helpful in solving problems in a timely manner. Mr. Tang, who cleaned the pool, cleaned the pool very clean.

The water temperature is suitable for swimming in the evening without feeling cold. The hotel has its own parent-child paradise, which is also suitable for traveling with children and the elderly. It is a good place to eat, drink and have fun. The hotel has its own restaurant with many dining options. The Thai food tastes good and is worth a try, and the production is also very good. It makes people linger and forget to return, and the overall cost performance is high. You can‚Äôt go wrong with it as your first choice!

msg:I came to Sanya alone with my 3-year-old child and stayed in this hotel for 2 consecutive nights. When I arrived at the front desk of the hotel, I remembered that the front desk was receiving customers who had arrived first. At this time, the front desk manager, Manager Xiao, looked at me holding my child and immediately came over to open a new check-in counter for us.
My child got motion sick on the way to the hotel. He vomited the breakfast he had just eaten on the floor and stools in the hotel lobby. It was really embarrassing. I didn‚Äôt have any help to clean up. The child was very clingy and kept asking me to hold him. I said I would pay for the cleaning. Manager Fei said no, which was really touching. When I checked in, I was upgraded to a room typeü•πü•π.
We were suffering from the flu before we came here and were in poor condition. Coupled with vomiting, we were not able to play much. He was really happy to see the swimming pool of the single-family villa. Although he can't swim, he especially likes to run around the swimming pool and step on the water. He likes to look at every corner. He also likes the oversized bathtub. I didn't want to come out even after soaking once.
The manager also told the restaurant to take special care of us. My suitcase happened to be broken. The manager told us that there was an outlet nearby where we could buy a new one. It was very close to the hotel and it only cost a few yuan to take a taxi. Otherwise, I really don‚Äôt know how to drag a broken box and a child who doesn‚Äôt want to walk back.
I really didn‚Äôt have any plans and made many last-minute decisions. The hotel is very cozy and has a resort feel, and the floor tiles are also very unique. Thank you Pullman, thank you front desk manager Xiao. I will definitely stay here next time I come to Sanya!

Arrived a little earlier, the room has been arranged, and I checked in directly, which was very smooth. There is a seesaw at the entrance of the villa, and the children are very happy.
The facilities are a bit old, but they have everything you need, and the service staff are very polite. The key is that the swimming pool is very clean, and the lights are bright and clear at night. Night swimming is no problem at all. The main thing is that you can bring children to the pool if you want it. Access to the bathroom was very convenient.
The cleaning aunt is also very enthusiastic. Before breakfast, I contacted to clean the room and the swimming pool. After eating and shopping, I came back and went directly to the swimming pool. The cleaning request left a note to the aunt, and the aunt replied enthusiastically, and all the requirements were fulfilled.
When I was leaving, Manager Zhang Nan asked me carefully what the itinerary was and if I needed to delay check-out for a while. We flew early in the morning so there was no need, but I personally think this is very considerate and humane. Although many hotels can do it, they need to talk about it themselves. They give priority to the needs of customers, and the impression is better.

msg:I booked a two-bedroom room. In fact, the living room was converted from a double-bed suite into a twin-bed room. When I opened the door, I saw two single beds. My wife took the children and the elderly to check in first. After getting the room, she found that the table and chairs were shaking and the room facilities were poorly repaired. After waiting for a few hours, they changed rooms. The tables and chairs were normal, but The overall condition, especially the hygiene of the bathroom (perhaps due to the decoration style), the floor is mottled, and the bathroom facilities are old, it can only be said that they are still usable. I went to the store with my family in the evening, and when I took a shower, I found that all the towels were threaded, and one hand towel had yellow spots on it. I really couldn't accept it. The breakfast the next day was even more novel. We, a family of five elderly people and children, went to the restaurant to dine. The management of the restaurant was quite chaotic. A young man who did not bring a nameplate was very impatient. We also understand that there are many people dining in the restaurant, but our request is to sit down. There was an air-conditioned indoor location. The young man was so angry that he said: You can go find it yourself. Fortunately, another girl from July showed up in time and finally arranged to be seated smoothly. However, the dishes are indeed average. The bacon and breakfast sausage are basically empty. If you want to take them, you have to keep an eye on them. There are only three varieties of fruits. There is no watermelon. The three varieties basically have no water. The bread is also hard to describe. Danish feels damp and lacks the aroma of bread. This may be due to a longer storage time or a problem with the storage environment.
Generally speaking, the hotel room hardware is in poor condition, and the price and brand are completely unmatched. The breakfast has many varieties but the quality is about the same as that of the whole season. The service is almost zero. I felt a little bit of attention during the breakfast period. My wife asked for a bowl of noodles. The taste of the snail rice noodle was palpable. A supervisor lady took the initiative to ask the kitchen to make a very clean bowl of noodles. This was very heartwarming, but other services during the entire stay were disappointing.
By the way, I told the housekeeper later that if there really was no suitable room, why did he give me an upgrade suggestion when my wife suggested that the room was unacceptable? Even if payment is an option, giving the right of choice to guests is also a service. Does it have to be cleaned according to the room type?
I hope writing this will help the hotel management understand their own problems, and also hope to give other travelers some helpful reference.

Let‚Äôs talk about the room first: the difference between the second stay and the first stay is quite different. When I picked things up, I accidentally found a big one under the sofa. There are dead cockroaches and a lot of dust, which shows that the cleaning of the hotel is poor, the sanitation is only on the surface, the door gap is huge, the swimming pool is full of mosquitoes, leaves and bird hairs, and it costs 900 to book a Burmese style villa. Is it because I booked a cheap one? Just give me such a bad room? In the room near me, my door light is not on, is it treated differently? ...I can't give a good review, let's talk about the service: some problems in the room, including the car-calling service, were resolved in a timely manner, and the travel photos included are also good. I still liked the service, but the customer service took the initiative to find me and asked me for a 5-point praise , I said that I was very disappointed and I can only evaluate it truthfully. Unless I return 200, I can still accept it if I live in such a broken villa at the price of an ordinary room. As a result, the customer service mainly teases me. Back... chat with me for a long time about pictures? You can either do what you say, or don‚Äôt look for me, or you don‚Äôt agree, and I‚Äôll just evaluate it truthfully. You said you arranged a broken room for me, and you took the initiative to ask me for a good review? ? ? In the end, he said to come back and order an upgrade for me, my God, can you still believe it? I still want to thank you for helping me make an appoin**ent for travel photography. Travel photography called me. We made an appoin**ent at 6 o'clock in the evening the next day. I didn't get a call the next day. As a result, I called at 5:56 in the evening. It‚Äôs the same thing, if it‚Äôs free, you can make an appoin**ent and forget about it?

msg:The villa is okay, although it is a bit old, but it can be seen that the initial decoration is made of good materials, and the foundation is good, but the water in the swimming pool is a bit muddy. Although someone cleans it every day to measure the water quality, it can be seen from the naked eye The water was very turbid, especially in the No. 5 villa where I stayed later, and it was even more so after comparing the swimming pool (the last picture is the No. 5 couple villa where I lived later). I stayed for two days. The breakfast on the first day was very poor. I felt that there was nothing delicious, but it improved a little on the second day. The park feels relatively small. Of the three hotels on this trip, the cheapest one is also the one with the worst experience

The local Hainanese dishes in the hotel's Chinese restaurant are very authentic; the housekeeper Helena Chen Shanzhu is considerate and dedicated. If she needs nail clippers and mosquito coils to repair the shower, she will be serviced as soon as possible, and she also sent a coconut ü•• ! give it a like!
ps: It would be even nicer if the hotel had a battery car to pick up and drop off the beach regularly. It‚Äôs a little embarrassing to be asked about wearing a Marriott when going to the beach.

msg:I often stay in five-star hotels on business trips, so my evaluation will be more objective. This time I stayed in a deluxe pool view room on the second floor for around 1,600 a day.
Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages first:
The swimming pool is very beautiful and eye-catching, this may be the only advantage
The attitude of the service staff is quite good, but as a five-star hotel, this is a basic requirement. Didn't achieve excellence.
Breakfast was up to par.

shortcoming:
1 The room is old and not worth the price at all. The ancient tile floor seen when opening the door seems to take people back to ten years ago. The lights were dim, and even after all the lights were turned on, I still couldn't see clearly. There were broken furniture and mold everywhere.
2 The supporting facilities, including paddle boards, travel photography, swimming pools, and children's playground are all old. For example, the children's playground is not as good as the one in the shopping mall and is very old. The children's water park is very small, just a separate area. There is not even a slide in the swimming pool or anything.
We purposely took the minibus connection and were extremely disappointed.

Usually I am too lazy to comment, but because this hotel is seriously inconsistent with the price, I have never stayed in such a shabby and disappointing five-star hotel. It can basically only reach the level of three or nearly four stars, so I specially commented. It's one that can be saved.

The room is very large and has an independent swimming pool. You can change into your swimsuit at any time and swim üèäüèª. You don‚Äôt have to worry about being tanned by the sun üåû when you swim in the afternoon. The bathing room is connected to the swimming pool, and there are two bathing rooms, one of which is open-air.
In terms of service, I am very grateful to Xu Yiming, the housekeeper. He knew we were bringing children and told me to prepare a swimming ring for the children the day before. I was worried that the children would not be able to use adult swimming rings. I hope that a smaller swimming ring will be fine. No I thought that Manager Xu sent a big surprise the next day, which turned out to be a swimming bed, hahaha. What a big one! The children stopped playing video games and spent a long time playing in the swimming pool. This experience is really good, I highly recommend everyone to stay here. I am also very grateful to the housekeeper Chen Shanzhu for asking about our needs during our stay, their service is really good.

Then they couldn't be turned on. There was no air conditioner all day. No one answered my phone calls. Finally, I checked in I mentioned it in the hotel's public WeChat group at around 8pm, and only then did the hotel take it seriously and respond, and then sent someone to actually repair it. The hotel equipment and rooms are old. There are cobwebs and dust on the bedside. The swimming pool water is dirty. The temperature is always constant. There is no wheel in the morning or at night. Every time I use it, it feels like soaking in a hot spring. I have stayed in other hotels. The swimming pool is not like this, so it has nothing to do with the weather in Sanya. I booked an imperial two-room room with a private swimming pool in this hotel. The toilet was extremely dirty. The sides of the toilet and pool in the room were all black and brown! Use your life to ensure that all the above are true! The electrical panels are also damaged, so please consider carefully when choosing this hotel. Warm reminder: If you are staying in room 8029, please ask the front desk to change rooms immediately!

Thank you Xiao Min for your care.
If Yalong Bay is clean, Pullman can choose. After all, Pullman mainly focuses on villas. I walked around the hotel in the morning. Unexpectedly, the swimming pool villa is the main feature of his house. You can come and experience it, but you must close the door of the room. There are many plants in the villa area, and there are also small animals.

We booked a Thai-style villa, and it was really nice to have our own private pool. Take advantage of the moonlight to swim for a while at night, and you can jump into the pool immediately when you wake up during the day. Special praise to my room stewards Helena Chen Shanzhu and Max Xu Yiming, who are responsive to our needs and considerate, five-star praise.

To sum up, this trip in Pullman is still worthwhile, and I will consider coming here for vacation next time.

When he saw other residents doing some dangerous actions, he stopped him in time. The various facilities in the hotel are very old. The door of 5416 is still broken. It requires a lot of force to close the door. The crack in the door is still very large. In the dead of night, the sound on the road next to me is very clear. The swimming pool is basically 1.5m. The first time I encountered it, on the day of check-out, before 12 o'clock, I called to ask if we would like to extend our stay. It gave me the feeling that we were being urged to leave...
It is recommended that Ctrip carefully benchmark hotel star ratings.

The receptionist at the lobby said that they would change us to a Myanmar villa. Ctrip checked that the price of the Myanmar villa was lower than that of Nanyang. I have never experienced a price increase instead of a price decrease when staying in a hotel. , when we asked, it was said that the Nanyang villa required security inspection. It was not that there were operations that the property owner could not understand. The breakfast was very average and there was a big gap between it and a five-star hotel. Overall, I feel that there are few waiters and the service cannot keep up. The worst thing is that after the guest room has been cleaned, there are still hair and dirt on the bed. I contacted the lobby and just said I was sorry. I told the guest room that there was no way to deal with it. The whole feeling is really powerless to complain, anyway, I won't stay here next time.

msg:Super cost-effective pool villa hotel, the overall environment is very Southeast Asian, beautiful and comfortable, slowly enjoying the Thai style. Although the room is equipped with a private swimming pool, it is also recommended to play public swimming pools with high, medium and low levels. Thanks to Zhang Nan, the service manager, for contacting us about our travel plan before arriving, giving reasonable suggestions, carefully arranging the room, and trying his best to meet the needs of the children. He is very professional and nice. The seafood barbecue buffet by the pool is also good, everyone likes it, and I didn‚Äôt feel tired after eating it for two nights haha~ I will come again if I have a chance!

He not only added a lot of mineral water to us, but also gave us two big coconuts, which were carefully iced in the refrigerator. A big thumbs up for Manager Zhang‚Äôs heart-warming serviceüëç! Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel again. It has a beautiful Southeast Asian style. The Thai-style villa we stayed in has a quiet environment and a full holiday a**osphere. The hotel room attendant Xiong Hui is also a careful young man. Seeing that we have children, he specially sent children‚Äôs toiletries. The hotel‚Äôs aunt is also very good. She introduced many delicious and interesting things nearby in detail. In short, it‚Äôs great! It was a great trip!

msg:I have heard about the Pullman Hotel for a long time, and I have not tried it many times in Sanya. I want to experience a villa vacation this time, so I made a decisive choice. I was hesitant before moving in. After all, Pullman does not rely on the beach and has no sea view, but it is actually very convenient to go to the beach. You don't need a car and you can walk there. This time we chose a Thai villa room type, the room is very spacious, the swimming pool is also very large, and the water quality is very good, it is circulating water, and the water temperature is also very suitable. As soon as we checked in, the staff came to salvage the leaves on the water surface. It can be said that this is the The hygienic conditions are the best among the villa-type hotels I live in. The service industry of the hotel is very good. The marketing manager (Zhang Nan Edward) is very enthusiastic. Knowing that we want to rent a unicorn, he helped bargain the price. The housekeeper (Xu Yiming Max) is also very careful. The hot weather has prepared a lot of drinking water for us. The little brother who drove the sightseeing car was also very enthusiastic to chat with us. This time is a couple's outing. Next time you come to Sanya, bring the elderly and children and choose a bigger villa.

There are many hotels of the same price in Yalong Bay, but it is still it when you open the window and jump out of the swimming pool. After eating breakfast, a lot of koi will swim in the pool water. It is still it. The sea breeze blows in the morning and opens the water lily to look at me.

It is said that the boats and paddle boards with online celebrity check-in cards can be used for free, but generally they float far away, and you have to swim there by yourself

Compared with the Hilton and Westin I stayed at before, this Pullman really won my heart. Although the facilities are not very new, but the service is in place in all aspects, and the scenery is really good~~ Old money should like it right!
Tell me a few details:
1) My sunglasses accidentally fell into the pond next to the banquet hall. Daniel and his team from the food and beverage depar**ent (brother Zhong Lei) helped me salvage them with all my heart. Do you understand the feeling of recovering something I love, family members! !
2) Libby and Miss Anne at the front desk are very nice, very patient and love to laugh, and helped me upgrade the room type, hahaha
3) When I was eating at the restaurant at night, I asked the restaurant if there were any delicate cakes that I could order. I was willing to pay extra, and my little brother came over seriously and told me that the delicate cakes need to be reserved, but you can pack a few ready-made small paper cups cake~
Overall, I feel that the staff here are more empathetic and have a certain level of empowerment. It is not necessary to report to the superior for permission for some trivial matters. This is the prerequisite for the service to be done well.
Next time I come to Sanya, I will still choose this place first, the service is max!

The next morning, I found that the air conditioner was flickering and was waiting for maintenance. It was used since 2008. In addition, the hinge of the shower door leading to the swimming pool is crooked, and the door cannot be opened for use. The public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is concentrated in the main building near the front desk, and you need to go through other hotels to go to the beach.

msg:Service: First of all, give the service manager Zhang Nan a hundred praises. Ten thousand praises are not enough. The service is really in place, especially in place. If there are any problems, the service manager Zhang Nan will respond very positively, and all the requests put forward are as good as possible Done, putting the customer first, is worthy of being a service manager, because of you, our journey is very satisfying. Then I want to praise Auntie Cleaning, she is very warm and polite. The child said that he wanted to draw, and Auntie Cleaning actually helped find a pen and paper for the child to draw. She was very considerate of the customer and brought children's products for the child Children's bathrobes and children's slippers, praise for the enthusiasm of the cleaning lady üëç Then there are lifeguards Chen Tianbin and Chen Zhi, who carefully put on swimming equipment for us, and also provided us with a transparent boat to help us take pictures. They are very enthusiastic and very friendly Responsible. The little buddies on the shuttle bus are also very polite, and they will say hello when picking up and dropping off. The parents are very happy, and they are worthy of the service of a star hotel. Especially thank you to the service manager Zhang Nan for the special arrangement and experience a different trip. I can't say enough about it.
Environment: very Southeast Asian, coconut grove, tropical style, you can hear insects and birds in the room, as well as the sound of various small animals, close to nature, children like it very much, there are also bubble activities in the children's pool, fun Can't play enough.
Facilities: The bathtub is oversized, the bed is also oversized, and the shower room leads directly to the swimming pool, which is very convenient. The only thing is that there is no wifi.
In addition, I have a little suggestion: the grill chef in the restaurant is a little impatient, and the service is slightly inferior to other staff. It would be better if you could be more patient and enthusiastic.
The travel photos sent by the hotel are also very good, there is no sales promotion, no compulsory consumption, the photos are very patient and beautiful. The hotel's pool view room is also very good, with direct access to the swimming pool. The swimming pool is very large and fun.
My parents were very happy this time, and our whole family had a great time. The only fly in the oin**ent may be the restaurant. There are not many types of breakfast and dinner, and the service is a bit inferior.
Overall, I am very satisfied. Thank you again for your warm service and adding a lot of beauty to our journey.

First of all, after the reservation, Cindy, the lady at the front desk, took the initiative to contact and communicate, and tried her best to satisfy and understand the questions and demands of the guests (especially I am relatively troubled). Haha, thank you! Next, the handsome Zhang Nan, the hotel manager, confirmed the needs of the guests, and served like a personal butler, reflecting the professionalism of the hotel staff. Before I checked in, I was afraid that the pictures might not match the actual situation of the hotel, but I was too worried and embarrassed. The room service is very good. The cleaning sisters, Qin Guiyun and Li Hongming, are very reliable in completing the work without disturbing the guests, meticulous in cleaning and screening the practical items of the guests (I litter them...). Already looking forward to the next Pullman trip, hahaha, I hope it will come soon!

The service staff is not enough to wear work clothes and they are very casual. Let's talk about check-in.. I was stunned ...The floors are all broken and uneven. I know this hotel has a sense of age. I didn't expect it to be so age-like. The swimming pool in the room can only be a decoration because it is really dirty and the bottom is yellow. The wifi can't be used.. I really do I got drunk and called someone to fix it. I looked at it and said I had no choice but to leave. The most amazing thing is that I found something missing two days after I left Sanya. I called the front desk and asked someone to look for it. I found it right away and I was curious. Isn't this cleaned on the same day as the store leaves? Customers can find things in time if they leave something behind. They didn't clean it after two days. Fortunately, they sent it back to me. Thanks to the service staff.

msg:This time, I chose to stay at the Pullman Yalong Bay Resort and Villas with my baby. I also made a strategy before coming here. Before coming to Sanya, I made a reservation after reading a lot of Ctrip reviews and small comprehensive analysis comparisons. When I made the reservation, I read a lot of bad reviews. To be honest, I was a little hesitant. I really wanted to give it a try. I didn‚Äôt expect it to give Our trip was like no other.

As the person in the family who is in charge of catering, accommodation and travel itineraries, I must first talk about the biggest surprise for me personally every time I go out, that is, I received a check-in reminder call from the hotel housekeeper Helena the day before check-in, and on the day of check-in due to us The itinerary was ahead of schedule, and Helena actively helped us coordinate the square shape. During the period, she also enthusiastically introduced us to various attractions in Sanya. It really made me a lot easier as a person who came to Sanya for the first timeüëç

Next, I have to talk about Pullman‚Äôs villas. A particularly large villa area starts with the number 678. The larger the number, the higher the villa‚Äôs level, and the price is also different. The landscape in the villa area can be seen to be carefully designed. Yes, even just taking a walk and taking pictures is beautiful. The decoration style of the hotel is Southeast Asian. The room is not new but it can be seen that it has been decorated. However, I suggest that the furniture really need to be replaced. It is already the furniture of the 90s. No matter how you paint it white The furniture looks dilapidated wherever it is placed. I hope the management of the hotel can see it. The floor is also dirty with black marks. Let the elder sister clean it and she can't remove it even if she brushes it hard. There are too many flowers and plants, which will lead to mosquitoes. If you are afraid of mosquitoes, you must be prepared to be bitten by mosquitoes before booking a room. You can walk to the beach in 10 minutes. There are many beautiful green plants in the villa area, and the service staff in the villa are also very enthusiastic. They will take the initiative to greet guests when they see them, and I personally feel that they are more enthusiastic than the waiters at Haitang Bay Hotel.

To sum up: the park is beautiful, the service staff is proactive and enthusiastic, and the room decoration is ancient

As a hotel person, I want to praise this hotel.

Facilities: Reminder, everyone, after coming out of the swimming pool, do not bring water into the room and pour it on the ground, because the ground will be very slippery if it gets wet. I am an old man who folded his big toe while wearing slippers.
The room as a whole has a Southeast Asian style, the linen is very comfortable, and the toothbrush soap is very like.
The air conditioner is very good, and it can be adjusted to 26 degrees when sleeping.

Hygiene: Hygiene üíØ, the water in the swimming pool is relatively clean. In mid-April, the water temperature in the afternoon is just right.
I stayed for 2 nights, and the next morning when the room lady came to clean, she was also very quick and in place.

Environment: Environment üíØ, a really comfortable hotel, if you are lucky, you can see little squirrels running on the eaves, very cute. As shown in the picture, there is also a small fruit given to me by the little squirrel. The overall ecology is really good üëçüèª.

Service: Service üíØ, I took a taxi from Sanya Bay at about 12 noon. When we checked in, the lady at the front desk upgraded the room for us, but it will take a while to clean the room. When storing luggage, the big brother at the concierge enthusiastically suggested and recommended us to go to Tropical Paradise Forest Park. During the tour, I received a call from the front desk that I could check in. There is also a shuttle bus from the lobby to the villa, which is very convenient for the enthusiastic concierge brothers to pick up and drop off.
Breakfast is also very rich.

msg:The hotel has been around for some years, and the advantage in Sanya, where dozens and hundreds of new hotels and homestays are added every year, is not obvious. The facilities are old, and I don't see the hotel's intention to renovate and update. Even so, it can be seen that the new hotel was built in a big way. The whole hotel is designed in a Southeast Asian style. The lobby is transparent and cool, which makes people feel very comfortable. The pool villa is very beautiful, and the bathroom is spacious. There are two showers inside and outside and a jacuzzi bathtub. , if the furniture and TV in the room can be replaced, it is still worth living. There is a living room in the villa that is like a chicken rib, and I haven't been in it for two days. It is recommended to change it into a small bedroom and add a toilet and shower, so that it can be used as a family room. The food and beverages are very average. It‚Äôs okay to just want to be full, but there is no quality and grade at all from the dishes to the dishes to the service. The amazing thing is the Spa, the environmental services and essential oils are very good, and the prices are reasonable. The only downside is that there is no front desk, no one greets you when you walk in, and you can't be greeted until one of the therapists finishes. Anyway, the whole hotel feels like saving money and labor, but this is really not a long-term solution unless it needs to change hands or redecorate.

msg:I gave birth to two children in three years, and because of the epidemic, I have never taken my children far away. This time in March, I suddenly planned to take my children from Weifang, Shandong, and flew half of China to Hainan. Before arriving in Hainan, I called the lobby several times to ask for various details.
Alice at the front desk thoughtfully upgraded the room type for free. I booked the entry-level room 5107 of this hotel, but the service in the pool view room is very good. Although it is a bit humid and the air conditioner is a bit loud, the various advantages of this hotel cover it Get past the downside.
The breakfast is also very rich, at least as a northerner, you will not feel that you have nothing to eat if you eat breakfast twice.
And the little sister who cleans the room is very responsible. The second child smelt badly on the balcony. I was in a hurry and forgot to throw it out. When I came back, the little sister had already cleaned it up. All the bath towels and towels in the room were replaced with new ones. And every time I go out, I will greet you warmly, thank you very much.
There are two single beds and a small sofa chaise longue in the twin room, which can be seamlessly connected between the two beds, just like adding a small bed to prevent the child from falling out of bed.
Not far from Dongrong Plaza, there is a small supermarket inside, where you can buy basic daily necessities, and there are also many delicious foods.
The downside of this hotel is that it is a long way from the beach, and you have to pass through Marriott or Sheraton. When asking for directions, the staff inside will first ask if you are a hotel guest.
The little girl there is also very gentle. She took more than 100 pictures, and finally deleted 17 pictures, 10 free, and the remaining 7 pictures, 20 yuan each, a total of 140, which is still very cost-effective.
The brothers and sisters in the Recreation Depar**ent are very enthusiastic. Dong Zhangjuan and Zheng Yuqing, the sisters of the Children‚Äôs Paradise, are very patient with the children. Tang Yifeng, Hu Huanli and Chen Tianbin, the younger brothers who manage the swimming pool, are very good at serving.
The waiter Chen Xiaoli also sent two fresh coconuts to the two children, haha, the taste is very good.
I lost my room card when I checked out. I said I needed to make up the money, and the girl at the front desk said it was fine, as long as I had fun, it was great. In short, the experience is very good, and I will come again in the future.

This is very important. My friend and I live in the The swimming pool room, his family is relatively thick and famous for the villa type, I think if you bring children, the villa type of his house should be very good, and it has its own swimming pool. The breakfast variety is also quite rich, but don't go at the end of the day, there are too many people. . . Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper HELENA for sending coconutsü••

msg:This hotel allowed me to see the differences between hotels in the same group. I used to stay at a few hotels across the street, such as the Ritz Marriott and others near the sea. This villa is not facing the sea, but has larger rooms. Just gave it a try. First of all, all the staff were smiling. It took less than ten hours after entering the room. First of all, on the first night, the electric card burned out and there was no electricity. It took a long time to repair it, and I was covered in mosquito bites. The air conditioner broke down again the next morning, and my roommate also had a cold and fever. It took 40 minutes from the first phone call, and I kept waiting in an environment of 30 degrees Celsius. Later, I made four or five calls. Everyone who answered the phone seemed not to know what was going on, and had to repeat it again and again. Moreover, the phone number in the room called "front desk" was not the front desk. The person who answered the phone had to contact the front desk again, which wasted time again. Then the person with the fever kept waiting like this, and emphasized on the phone that someone was sick. Their attitude is that of a cold robot. It took two hours to finally change. The new room has electricity, but there is dirt in the bathtub, the wifi has signal but no network, and the toilet water pressure is not enough to flush. Moreover, the price of the room type we booked was similar to that of the hotel opposite the seaside, and the experience was 0 points. At the same time, there was no one in the hotel's public swimming pool, and there were a bunch of toys floating around. The water was half full, and it looked like it hadn't been cleaned. The entire hotel is also very eerie at night and deserted during the day. Except for the shuttle bus at work, there are almost no lights at night. Will never go again. It is not recommended for young people to go. People who want to stay in a room only can choose. This is my first time staying in a five-star hotel with 0 points like this. I‚Äôm speechless.

When I swam at around 9pm, I touched all the water filters and water inlets of the swimming pool. There was no movement. I called the front desk to arrange for someone to come and check. When I came, I was told that it was not 24 hours. It was turned on at fixed times in the morning and afternoon, and then I went swimming again around ten o'clock the next day, and there was still no movement at all the filter ports and water inlets üòÇ

The large bathtub in front of the window and the walk-in shower in the courtyard are very Thai-style. It feels like one with nature, and the courtyard surrounded by walls is very private. Since it is a villa hotel, there are relatively few guests and the overall is very quiet. The food is rich and delicious, and the service is fast and in place. Special thanks to the service manager Zhang Nan for his meticulous care these days, see you next time Pullman!

The hotel service is warm, well-proportioned, warm and unobtrusive. In particular, I would like to thank Zhang Nan, Mr. Zhang, for contacting us in advance and giving us a lot of advice and help. When we learned that we arrived on a night flight and needed help, we deliberately waited in the lobby late at night. Everything After getting settled, you can get off work. Such dedicated and professional managers are the hotel's greatest wealth! The other staff I came into contact with during the stay, even though they are very busy and have a heavy workload, they can still smile and take the initiative, which is commendable. Although some facilities are indeed old, it can be seen that they have been gradually repaired and renovated, and there was no noise or smell during our stay. It is recommended that the hotel still need to increase the number of waiters. It feels that there are many fewer staff than other hotels.

My husband was going to use a drone to take pictures of the hotel's scenery, but he hung the small plane on a tree... After calling Manager Zhang Nan, there was a dedicated person in charge The staff helped us take it down, because there was a mango tree next to it and picked a mango for me. I felt the enthusiasm and responsibility of the people of Hainan. In the case of a private pool, it is still possible to enter the water after the sun comes out, and there is no smell of disinfectant, and it is generally clean. Although the hotel is a bit old, it is worth coming if you are looking for a private villa experience and there are few people. It would be even better if the hotel's catering can be improved a little~ Overall, it is a good vacation experience.

Breakfast is useless, there is tilapia to feed. The room is really difficult to describe. I slept for less than 10 hours in total in two days. First, the toilet couldn‚Äôt get water. At that time, the child was already asleep and my husband repaired it by himself. After a while, it broke after using it. At night, the toilet is on the left The constant sound of water, and the cry of unknown fighting frogs on the right complement each other. The next night the toilet was ready and it was the main battlefield for mosquitoes. I don‚Äôt know what kind of mosquito killer I used, but it didn‚Äôt work at all. I inserted it into the head of the bed, and the mosquitoes were buzzing above my head. The child was bitten into a seven-spotted ladybug.
We did not go to the Yanoda that was given away. It is said that all the entrances are at our own expense, and we need to make an appoin**ent one day in advance to go to the duty-free shop.

msg:This hotel belongs to the second-tier luxury hotels in Yalong Bay. I booked it one month in advance during the Spring Festival. The price is 2,000 yuan for a two-bedroom hotel with breakfast for a family of 4 people. It is a good value for money. But after checking in, I checked the price and found that it had already risen to 4,000 yuan. This price may make people scold me, hahaha. Let‚Äôs start the formal review of the hotel: 1. The geographical location is not close to the sea. It is in a second-tier location. The first-tier hotels in the front row are close to the beach, which is good but very expensive. In the past, the beach was private to those hotels, but now the government stipulates that it is shared, so the Pullman is also close to the beach. Well, it‚Äôs a 5-minute walk and you can also enjoy the facilities of the first-tier hotels in the front row, which is great. 2. The room facilities and bedding are all good, in line with five-star standards. The tatami on the balcony is also very comfortable. You can touch the banana tree (it seems to be) up close on the balcony, which is quite characteristic of Southeast Asia. However, the hotel room settings are very strange. The risk control of the two rooms is unified, which means that if one room lights up, the other will also light up. Moreover, there are no light switches on the bedside of the two beds in the twin room, making it difficult to use the toilet at night. It needs to be discredited, this is very inhumane. 3. The advantage of hotel service is that it has dedicated customer service and can contact us in advance via WeChat. Zhang Nan‚Äôs service is very good, but leaving the hotel requires a 5-star review. I often read Ctrip reviews, so I want to provide reference and help to others. I will only write about myself. I want to say, sorry. The indoor service in the restaurant is not good, it is a bit chaotic, and I am not happy that the seat is occupied. However, I left the hotel at 6 o'clock on the last day to catch a flight, and the restaurant helped prepare packed breakfast in advance, which was a good review. 4. Public facilities. The hotel is really not small, but many single-family villas have little space for public use. Basically, the feature is a very large and long swimming pool, which cannot be used in winter. There is a huge difference between public facilities and first-tier hotels with front desks. Therefore, considering the reasonable price during the Spring Festival holiday, the overall experience of this stay was quite good. Thank you to the hotel. From now on, I will work hard to make money and try to stay in front-row hotels. I visited several hotels this time and found that having money is really good, hahaha.

It happens that the person in charge of our hotel reservation and service is a fellow, manager Zhang Nan, and the service is very good.

msg:Choosing to stay at the Pullman Yalong Bay Resort & Villas is both accidental and inevitable. Before coming to Sanya, I browsed a lot of hotel reviews and strategies of Ctrip and Xiaohongshu, and made a reservation after comprehensive analysis and comparison. different experiences.

As the person in the family who is in charge of catering, accommodation and travel itineraries, I am really worried every time I travel, so first of all, I must talk about the biggest surprise for me personally, that is, I received the hotel service manager Zhang Nan the day before check-in. The check-in reminder call, and because our schedule was ahead of schedule on the day of check-in, Manager Zhang actively helped us coordinate early check-in. During the period, he also enthusiastically made buffet dinner reservations and SPA time coordination and communication for us. It really made me a family housekeeper a lot easier üëç

Next, I have to talk about Pullman's villas and tranquility, a particularly large villa area, starting with the number 678, the larger the number, the higher the villa level, and of course the more beautiful the price, as can be seen from the landscape in the villa area Well-crafted, even just a walk can de-stress. In addition, the decoration style of the hotel is Southeast Asian, which looks simple and elegant. The rooms are not new but the materials are exquisite. The small iron gate outside the pool view room opens to a swimming pool passage. You can walk to the public swimming pool in a few steps. Bring your children It's really convenient~

The hotel's catering and SPA are highly recommended experiences. The price/performance ratio is really high. The key is that no matter the buffet breakfast included in the room or the poolside buffet dinner that needs to be purchased separately, you can feel the freshness of the ingredients and the skill of the chef. ;The SPA is held in the villa area. It is super private and quiet. There is a shuttle bus to pick us up in the lobby. My personal feeling is that the young lady's technique is also good~

To sum up, Pullman is really a hotel with high cost performance and a good sense of experience among the high-end hotels in Yalong Bay in terms of garden scenery, dining and leisure, and exclusive space! The only fly in the oin**ent is that it is a little far from the beach. Compared with sea view hotels, each has its own merits~ Next time I come, I decide to experience the villa decisively!

I asked about the arrival time in advance the night before check-in, and arranged to upgrade the Nanyang villa to the Myanmar villa. Before leaving the hotel, I was considerate Ask if you need a late checkout.

msg:Pullman Yalong Bay, a warm place to stay during the journey

I planned a New Year‚Äôs Day trip in early December. I bought a Pullman room coupon on Ctrip. There will be no price increase during the New Year‚Äôs Day. 1388 includes 2 nights in a double room with pool view, two breakfasts, one afternoon tea, welcome fruit, travel photography, duty-free shop 95 Discount + free pick-up service. It is easy to make an appointment from January 1st to 3rd, and the overall experience is perfect.

Location: One of the hotels on the beach of Yalong Bay, which is not completely close to the sea, so the price is nearly half cheaper than that of hotels close to the sea, and the price/performance ratio is excellent. It only takes 8 minutes to walk to the beach, and there is no delay in anything.

Service: This is what I am most satisfied with. Zhang Nan, the service manager who received me, contacted me by phone one day in advance to find out about the approximate check-in time and room requirements (standard room or double bed). I checked in the next day with great peace of mind and arrived. Everything was ready at the hotel, and the process was very fast. The day before leaving, I will also ask for feedback on WeChat in advance, whether I am satisfied with the overall accommodation environment, etc., I feel very at home.

Room:
I like it very much. I live in a basic room type, with an area of about 30 square meters. There is also a large bathtub. My favorite is the balcony behind the door. I can sit outdoors at night, facing the coconut trees in the swimming pool, watching the stars and chatting. It is very comfortable.

Environment: The hotel is not very big, it is relatively easy to find, and it is very friendly to road ****** like me. The swimming pool is very beautiful, but the temperature is not constant. The water is very cold in this season, which is a test.

Beach: Yalong Bay Beach is really unique, the emerald sea is so beautiful, the coastline is very long, the buffer is relatively large, and it is safe to step on the water without swimming.
There are many recreational facilities, such as flying dragons, motor boats, banana boats, and diving. Still pretty fun.

üè°We booked the Huangzun two-bedroom pool villa room, which can be regarded as the upper-class room type in this hotel. Like most hotels in the tropics, the hotel lobby is transparent, but the lights are a bit too dark at night, there are not enough waiters, it seems that it will never be busy, and the business is a bit slow. All villas need to take the hotel‚Äôs small shuttle bus to get to the door of the room. I still prefer this. Tropical villas are relatively large hotels, and the shuttle bus has become a local feature. It‚Äôs relatively fast to call a taxi. 24 There are hours, so you are not afraid of inconvenient travel.
üè©Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs facilities. In fact, there‚Äôs nothing bad about it. Normal check-in is okay, but the decoration is too old-fashioned. It feels like a hotel in the last century. The lighting in the room is not enough. The villa has its own swimming pool, but It seems that I don‚Äôt want you to swim at night. There are no lights in the yard, and it‚Äôs dark. If you want to sit in the yard for a while, you can‚Äôt see anything. The small bugs and the like can be controlled, so I don't worry too much. Living in this kind of yard will inevitably be afraid of some bugs. The hotel's public swimming pool is sufficient, and there is a second-floor swimming pool behind the gym with a very nice view. But this hotel is not close to the sea and does not have its own beach, but across the road, several hotels on the opposite side are close to the sea, so you can stroll around casually.
üè™There are shopping malls and snack streets around the hotel, where you can eat and drink casually, and the transportation is also very convenient. Because of the high cost performance, its villas are cheaper than other hotels, and the decoration may be the difference. But overall it's ok.

After adding WeChat, I answered all questions, and the response was warm, timely and thoughtful. When I arrived at the hotel, I found that the villa I booked had been warmly upgraded. I was very happy. The villa is very big, everything is big, the bedroom, living room, swimming pool, bathtub, bed... are all so big and comfortable, even children can play hide-and-seek in the villa. It is a little cold to swim in the water at this time, but the shower room can go directly to the swimming pool, so it is very convenient to take a bath immediately after swimming. The whole hotel has a Southeast Asian flavor, with plenty of Nanyang elements and features. Walking tours are very interesting. If you are lazy, you can call a 24-hour battery car. It's nice to live in your own villa.

Pullman's main villa room type, this time the ordinary room booked will be upgraded to a Myanmar villa, with exclusive access to private villas and private pools! I have to say that the park is extremely quiet and the environment is pleasant, and the swimming pool next to the main building is also superb. The most satisfying thing is that compared with the bustling guests of several hotels near the sea, this place feels more like a resort for physical and mental cultivation. After switching to MGM, the experience has been directly upgraded a lot, and I will definitely come to this pullman next time!

After staying for two nights, on the first day, the sound of the motor behind the room was terrible. On the second day, there was a strange sound similar to decoration. The hotel staff Said to be the sound of bullfrogs, the price is more than 3,000 per night, the experience is not as good as that of an express hotel, the quality of breakfast is even worse, the porridge is rotten, and there are few dishes

msg:I have to say that the Pullman Yalong Bay Villa Hotel is very good. The location is also good. It is together with various big-name hotels. You can reach the beach by crossing the road and crossing the hotel. The scenery on the beach is very good, and the sea breeze is also good. Very comfortable, the sand is very soft. The swimming pool in the hotel is divided into 1.5 meters and a shallow area. Friends who live in the room directly connected to the swimming pool area should choose the swimming pool room in the shallow water area, otherwise the swimming pool will be closed at 6:00 pm. Next to the hotel lobby, there is a small shop specializing in swimming equipment. The swimming ring of the hotel can be rented to cheer up, and the price of the goods is not bad. The whole hotel is in Thai style. This building reminds me of the Mayan Dynasty. There is also a big slide in the raw pool. Unfortunately, it was not open when we went there. Because of the epidemic, we only stayed for one day and left. It‚Äôs a pity that there is a Baihua Valley near this hotel. There is a commercial street. There are many The price of snacks is high, the taste is average, but the a**osphere is very strong, children should like it very much. Compared with us, we prefer to cross the road and cross the hotel opposite to reach the beach, sit on the beach and enjoy the scenery. The overall experience of staying here is good. The service staff in the hotel are very friendly and will come next time.

msg:As someone who stays in a hotel for at least 70 days a year, I rarely give a hotel a bad review. But this time I stayed, I endured it again and again, and I really had to complain about this hotel.
1. The room is not clean, and cockroaches and ants can be seen everywhere. As a villa-type room, some geckos, mosquitoes, and spiders can understand everything, but the dead cockroaches and bedbugs in the room as shown in the picture are really speechless, and there are children, so children dare not go barefoot land.
2. Since the hotel is far away from the beach, there are battery cars to pull guests back and forth. In order to control labor costs, it is also understandable to set a time period and a limited number of round trips for the battery car. But when there was a sudden thunderstorm (at noon on August 4th), our family of three was trapped on the beach. We called the hotel to ask for a car to pick us up. The hotel replied coldly, "Our battery car has a time limit. One shift takes two hours." We feel that in the case of sudden extreme weather such as thunderstorms, the total distance does not exceed 700 meters. As a five-star hotel, it is unreasonable to treat guests so ignorantly and indifferently.
3. In such a big hotel, in the face of a sudden epidemic, the guests who need to check out and check in will almost fill the lobby, and there are only two people at the front desk to handle the formalities. There is also a need to answer guests' questions and answer the phone, and the hotel has not dispatched other staff to help. This simply refreshed my understanding of Pullman. Why is this Pullman in Yalong Bay not the Pullman I saw in other places?
        I have been to Sanya dozens of times, and I have stayed in several hotels. Like this time, it is the first time I have stayed in such a hotel for a room fee of nearly 3,000 yuan a night. What a very disappointing experience.

I commented that the hotel is relatively old and the facilities are very old. After I came here, I saw the actual situation was actually good, not as bad as the comments said, very nostalgic in Southeast Asia, and the hotel is very quiet and private, every service staff attitude It's very good, especially Leona at the front desk and Tang Yifeng, the service younger brother, are very warm. Maybe it's because the hotel has been open for a long time, so the villas here are cost-effective. You can compare the price with Haitang's hotel to know, probably everyone likes it. It‚Äôs different, everyone has their own preferences. In short, I prefer this Southeast Asian style. I highly recommend everyone to stay here after returning from the crowded Haitang Bay to enjoy the tranquility and privacy brought by the villa for one night.

Now, the service is good every time, but the food is slightly worse than the Hilton Hotel, but it is better than a villa with its own swimming pool, but the price this year is about 800 more expensive than before, I don't know if it is because of the proximity I just decided. I remembered that the price per night was around 1000 for the winter vacation. The staff were super enthusiastic and praised Qin Guiyun, Chen Boming, Wei Weihao, JACKY. Thank you.

Check in first. Even if I arrive a little earlier, I still can't check in at three o'clock. I have to wait another half an hour to check in. It will take me an hour to check in. Is it sick? During the period, I asked the front desk, and I didn‚Äôt know if the room was ready or not. I needed to keep calling to confirm, and then I asked the front desk again. I was waiting for my colleague to call back. Make people wait.
Then there is the room, the light is not good, it is very dark, the facilities are old, the carpet is dirty, and the toilet is not very sensitive. I don't know how the hotel arranges cleaning and check-in time. . After staying in the room for a while, someone knocked on the door to make sure the room was cleaned...
Finally, there is the swimming pool. The deep pool is too deep, and the shallow pool is too shallow. Why can't we give people like us who have half learned to swim a little way to survive...
For breakfast, it's ok, the only place where it's ok

It has both a public swimming pool and a swimming pool in the room. It is very suitable for several families to live together and have a pool party. In the past few days, I ate in the only restaurant in the hotel. In terms of ordering, the price per person was more than 100. The taste was not bad, and the portion was not too much. A family of three still had to order 3 dishes and 1 soup.
Hotel room: clean and tidy, no small animals and bugs, the whole room facilities and equipment are relatively old.
The swimming pool in the hotel room has a special person to salvage the sundries and disinfect them. Swimming is very reassuring. The entire hotel staff service is also very polite and warm.

The hotel has upgraded the parent-child room, but it is also a little next to the outdoor plane. 2 The connection between the waiters is not good. Many waiters are very young, like students who have not been trained. I eat in the restaurant because the room includes meals, but the front desk did not give me a meal coupon when I checked in. I reported the room number to the restaurant waiter. After confirming with the front desk, they served me the food. But after a while I was in the middle of eating and asked that I had to go to the front desk to get the coupon right away! I said, can't I wait until I finish eating? You have clearly communicated and confirmed that you still want to call me for a trip. 3 The bed sheets in the room are sandy, and I feel that there is no need to change the bed sheets when I check in. 4 The restaurant has two prices for one dish. I saw that the special price of white-cut chicken was 58 in the lobby. When I went to the restaurant to check out, it became 118. If I was not careful, I would be slaughtered. 5 The hotel swimming pool is very fun, which is the advantage, but pay attention to safety.

After nine o'clock, an employee said that he should change the room or he would sprinkle disinfectant to see in the morning.

The room facilities are a bit old but fortunately well maintained. I chose the Chinese restaurant in the hotel at noon and the service is good. Opposite the hotel is the Marriott, and the Yalong Bay beach is the most beautiful and sandy beach in the past two days. A good suggestion. You can buy a swimming ring without renting the rent.

You can feel the taste of the old five-star resort hotel, and it is recommended to stay.

Every employee gave me a comfortable and comfortable smile, without excessive enthusiasm, not a cold response, but a solid feeling from the bottom of your heart, just like the swimming pool in the villa, it makes people feel so leisurely, A strong holiday a**osphere surrounds you. The biggest treasure of Pullman is the staff of this hotel, they are the soul of Pullman like warm sunshine. Thanks to the honest and caring Mr. Zhang Nan, who really took good care of every guest. I'm looking forward to my next vacation at Pullman again.

msg:In the afternoon, I took a taxi for 1 km to the Pullman Yalong Bay Resort. It was really zero service. The lobby was so hot, there was no air conditioner or fan. After checking in, I was sweating profusely. I took my luggage and took a pick-up car to our yard. This time I stayed at the Myanmar Pool Villa, and the room was very cool with the air conditioner turned on. It's just that there are quite a lot of mosquitoes, and they shot two dead in front of the bed as soon as they came in. The Yalong Bay Pullman is too old, the decoration is extremely old, and the sanitary conditions are not good. The air outlet of the central air conditioner is black and moldy. The wooden decoration outside the swimming pool is tattered. There is a huge jacuzzi in the room, but the massage function damaged. This booking is all-inclusive, including three meals a day. I ate a Hainanese-style meal in the evening, with four dishes and one soup (there was a shell that had not been served when the photo was taken). The garden of the hotel is quite large, and after a meal, it feels like an original ecology. In addition to the huge number of mosquitoes and insects, there is also a small river. I saw a lot of big African snails on a wall. Pullman's service is even more ridiculous, adding a bowl of rice and not serving it after dinner. If Pullman is a good brand, but Pullman Sanya Yalong Bay is really bad. By the way, if you want to upgrade the room type, forget it, the service attitude is very poor, don't step on the thunder.

Fortunately, the Myanmar Pool Villa has been upgraded, and there is a separate small swimming pool where you can soak in water. The facilities in the hotel room are a few years old, but they are clean and tidy. I have to complain about the cleaning and disinfection of the bathtub...Because I found that the bathtub was not very clean when I checked in, I called the front desk and asked the staff to come over to clean and bring disinfectant for disinfection. After calling several times, I finally sent a bottle of disinfection at night I asked if it was delivered to the next room, and the other party replied that I only found this bottle... There is only such a small bottle of disinfectant in Nuoda's hotel, and it doesn't have the smell of disinfectant at all... Sanitary disinfection makes people feel Worrying...

üîîService: Absolutely five-star praise, considerate check-in, quick customer service response, and manual likes.

Stayed from the Hilton next door for a week, and the hotel's privacy is very good.
The room is very exquisite, especially the jacuzzi, which is very powerful to take a bath.
Affected by the epidemic, there are not many hotel guests. Among the holiday villa hotels with swimming pools, Pullman's price has an absolute advantage. The most important thing is that the hotel's service is very good!
Here, special thanks to:
1. Jason, the front desk staff, has a strong ability to deal with special situations, and can compare his heart to heart, which makes my stay experience doubled!
2. Helena, the room housekeeper, contact me in time after checking in. The follow-up check-in service is completely in accordance with the content of our communication, and professionalism is worth trusting; all problems can be properly solved in a very short time (because we originally I stayed here for a long time, and usually belongs to the "hypocritical" category, so there will be a lot of additional requirements.) Knowing that I am with children, I am worried that the children will be bored, and I am prepared in all aspects. Service is not mechanized, caring and enthusiastic; most importantly
3. Willian from the housekeeping depar**ent, a particularly caring little brother, is also very handsome, and he takes the trouble to help us like he treats his family.
I went to the front desk today and found that some guests communicated solutions with the hotel front desk manager (guess hahaha~) due to epidemic control reasons. After observing it, the determination to live is more firm.
I hope the epidemic will end soon, and I wish everyone a safe and healthy life~

This time, the hotel helped us to upgrade, the room size was bigger, it also handled late check-out, and also provided coconut drinks. Will stay at this hotel next time. I saw a lot of people saying that the swimming pool is dirty on the Internet. In fact, it is enough for the hotel to re-clean it. After all, it is an outdoor private swimming pool, and it is normal to have leaves occasionally. In the past, when I was on vacation in Thailand, the swimming pool often had fallen leaves and tree roots, and I had to ask the waiter to clean it every day. If you are used to staying in business hotels, you may not be used to this hotel, but I think that you should choose this type of hotel for vacation so that you can calm down in your usual busy work.

I decided to change to another hotel. , Old and dilapidated hotel, I'm really sorry for the price of 1000+. When checking in, there is not even a greeter to help with luggage. There are only 2 little brothers at the front desk, but they seem to have not been trained. The lady next to me consulted the room type, the waiter I didn't even say hello, I just walked away to do other things. At that time, the guests were instantly black face. I felt embarrassed when I looked at them. The front desk did not introduce any service items except for the breakfast location, and the card did not say how to connect to WIFI. I asked the service desk on the phone forever, and no one answered the phone for room service. Finally, I called the front desk and asked. When I entered the villa, I was stunned by the old and dirty. I have also stayed in other old hotels such as Tianyu. However, the room is just a little old, and the overall feeling is clean and comfortable, but the Pullman is shabby and dirty, the room has a musty smell, and the walls of the swimming pool and the air outlet of the air conditioner are all moldy. To be honest, the hotel garden is still Yes, it is still possible for small internet celebrities to take pictures, but don‚Äôt choose it if you want a comfortable vacation. The one-day trip to the sea given by the hotel is even more pitiful. A arrogant northeast driver picks up people from hotel to hotel, drives for nearly an hour, pulls a car of people down a wharf and sends them to a dilapidated ship, and then all kinds of tricks. Add money to play items, spend money to upgrade the so-called VIP warehouse, and tell you when you get on the boat, all the gift items are unpowered. Take a rubber boat as an example. Without power, you are tying a rope to a banana boat and floating on the sea, because The ship does not dock all day, so it is from 9 o'clock to disembark at 3 pm, and it is already 4 pm when I arrive at the hotel. I wasted a day on a search for a broken ship. In fact, spending money on projects is serious business. Everyone can accept it. The key is not to be so deceiving. Pullman‚Äôs cooperation with such a poor businessman seems to be even more expensive. In the next 4 days, he decisively chose 2 days for Shama and 2 days for Marriott. The price/performance ratio is much better than Pullman. , just spend money to buy lessons.

The hotel is also close to the beach, the hotel shuttle bus will take you there, and you can go directly through the Marriott when you come back.
üßπHygiene: Although the room was a little musty on the first day, it may be because the first floor was damp and it was an old hotel, but after communicating with the waiters: Qin Guiyun and Zhao Haixia, they immediately dealt with the areas that could be improved. The effect is better.

There is a pool and they also have some free tools for everyone to play with. The breakfast is very rich, combining Chinese and Western, but their coffee tastes average.
Not good: the room facilities are old-fashioned, maybe because of the water on the seaside, it smells like rotten wood as soon as you open the door of the room, the shower head in the room I live in is broken, and the socket in the bathroom is also broken. Hair is not very convenient.

All the way Marriott MGM live here
My favorite is the Pullman villa.
Really unexpectedly good
Swimming pool is huge
Children learn to hold their breath
Enjoy every minute here
There are many water systems in the hotel
I like it very much for those who are a little tired of watching the sea
Focus on the front desk baron is a little boy
The hotel seemed very busy the day we checked in
The staff are very impatient
But baron always maintains a particularly good work efficiency and attitude
Empathy if it were me, I couldn't do it
Recreation Club Swimming Pool Attendant Tang Huixing
The service attitude is also in place. The swimming pool is very clean
The cleaning aunt of 8048 is also very responsible and will meet any requirements.
If you come to Sanya again, Pullman Villas will definitely be a must.
Hope it gets better ‚ù§Ô∏è

Probably because they are too tired during the Spring Festival, most of the employees represented by this baron in the photo are always staring down at the desk or somewhere on the computer, and at a glance you know that you better not disturb them. Ask something at least three times before he hears it clearly. One of the times I passed by the front desk and asked if I had any matches. The BARON ignored it but was very serious and raised his voice to say that our hotel is a non-smoking hotel, no smoking. He finally raised his head and looked at me. at a glance. However, at breakfast the next day, I saw someone smoking in the restaurant unattended. In short, the price of more than 1,000 a day is not worth it.

The room type facilities are not very new, but they are okay. The swimming pool is very big, which should be the biggest selling point. The swimming pool hopes that guests will check it out personally before checking in. It just rained and there were a lot of earthworms during the check-in! There are many guests in the hotel, the service is very good, and any problems can be solved immediately. I have basically stayed in hotels in Yalong Bay. In fact, there is no need to be too entangled. Just choose a hotel according to your own needs and economic strength.

It was obvious that a child under 12 years old had breakfast in the room. I went to the front desk to confirm that it was not included. Or not to say. After staying for three days, the breakfast at the hotel has not changed, and I don't want to spend a lot of money to pay for the breakfast, and it is already more than 10:00. The hotel breakfast ends at 10:30, and I don't want to spend any more time with the store. The sister at the front desk was impatient. I don't know if it was because I felt that the cost of breakfast for children was not worth looking down on. Anyway, it was confirmed later that it was indeed included. But it's past dinner time. So we ordered McDonald's to eat. It's really not good to leave such an impression on the last day of leaving Sanya

But in fact, most of them come here for vacation, not to decorate their own homes. Anyway, it is a matter of a few nights. The comfort of staying is the first thing. It is completely satisfying and the price is moderate. Many international hotels here are similar, but you I totally experienced a different feeling in Pullman. Southeast Asian architectural style, you are ready to come out all morning inside the hotel, it is really good to take pictures.

üîîService: The service I want to mention the most is the service. I haven't checked in yet, the service manager Zhang Nan called to confirm the check-in time, added WeChat, and posted thoughtful tips such as duty-free bus and beach shuttle time. After arriving, the room type was upgraded and the experience was better. This hotel must pay great attention to service. Every staff member is very polite and takes the initiative to carry luggage. The most heard sentence is just leave it to me. Is this what you most want to feel when you go out on vacation? The small transportation in the hotel is convenient, and there is a battery car to pick up and drop off at any time in the villa area. In fact, it hasn't been a long time.

üöó Transportation: There are many international hotels in Yalong Bay, 5 minutes from Dongrong Square and 3 minutes from the sea. The Sun Bay Highway starts here, and it is really beautiful. The sea water here is really the best.

üßπSanitation: It is really clean, the hotel has good greenery, and the rooms are also very clean.

üçÉEnvironment: Southeast Asian architectural style, the Thai villa I live in is 270 square meters, each house has an independent yard, it is very quiet.

Put a few photos, the room photos are exactly the same as the official website and see for yourself. The main reason is that the environment of this hotel is really good, the style is unique here, the service training is in place, and it is really the first choice to come on vacation in the future.

You can store your luggage after 12 o'clock. Go to the nearby Yalong Bay Forest Park. It takes 10 minutes to drive. It‚Äôs the same as the business picture,

msg:üöó Transportation: It is very convenient, it takes only 5-6 minutes to walk through the beach, the starting price of a taxi from the Yalong Bay commercial center, it is very convenient to go out and eat, but the hotel is actually delicious haha!
üßπHygienic: Pullman is an old hotel. The overall decoration is more retro and woody, but it is clean and comfortable. The old five-star software is reflected in the service staff who come to clean every day. They will clean every corner very seriously. Fold up the clothes I littered, and made me a cute little elephant linen~
üçÉEnvironment: I like this hotel better than the modern decoration hotel. If you can't go abroad, you can pretend to be in Southeast Asia. Haha, the garden inside the hotel is very beautiful, and the paths in the villa area are super popular~
üîîService: I especially want to praise the hotel‚Äôs service. From the moment we arrived at the hotel‚Äôs service manager, Zhang Nan took us to the hotel and chose the room, because when I returned to Beijing for Nucleic Acid, I also helped me find the nearest hospital for Nucleic Acid. Very experienced and gentleman service manager, the overall service is also very attentive, came to Sanya four or five times, this is a comfortable vacation

In addition, the hotel‚Äôs food is really delicious, the macarons are made at a five-star standard, and the pizza is also delicious. After ordering roomservice several times, it is unexpectedly cost-effective and delicious~ Mom said that the hotel‚Äôs food is real. Yes, this holiday really surprised me

msg:Pullman Yalong Bay is not a parent-child hotel. The obsession before I checked in was to always want to come, but I didn‚Äôt want to come. So due to the check-in issues and breakfast issues, I was planning to change to other hotels, but one person changed me in one day. She was Vivian. She solved all my puzzles and problems at one time, and talked to me about the ideals of the hotel. From the words of this young man, she can interpret the spirit of the hotel people and the hotel, and the hardware is dead. Talent is the foundation of service. Let‚Äôs talk about the details. The hotel rooms have mosquito nets. Basically, they are not afraid of children being invaded by mosquitoes. There are fish and ducks in the river in the hotel restaurant. While eating, babies can interact with animals. The concierge was very proactive. He took the luggage and took the initiative to deliver water. After opening the door, I found two bottles of mosquito repellent in the corner. They were put by vivivan. They were used to repel mosquitoes for children. They might be afraid of disturbing me. intimate. Then there is the restaurant. I booked the evening buffet. Before I arrived at the restaurant, Vivian had already ordered the baby chair and baby tableware to be placed in advance. The details were very well done. The overall meal quality of the restaurant is very high, although it is semi-buffet. But there are still many types of seafood, super cost-effective, and finally I left two buckets when I left the shop. Although it is not very expensive, it is indeed the memory of the baby's 4 years of playing on the beach and rushing to the sea. I have been there with my baby. It happened to be a sandy beach, and it happened to be found when I was rushing to the next hotel. There were no barrels of shells. Then Vivian helped me to deliver the barrels to the hotel 15 kilometers away. I was so touched. Pullman Yalong Bay may have been just an experience originally, but basically I will come here for one night as long as I come to Hainan in the future. This is the third time I came to Hainan this year. The baby gave Pullman the highest score, which surpassed MGM. , Children can't lie

msg:Really satisfied!
Let me talk about the advantages first. For the five-star hotel of the chain group, the price-performance ratio is the highest in Yalong Bay! There are few people, the service is very good, it can keep up with it, and it is very detailed. There are also cakes and decorations for birthdays. Thai villas are very recommended. The rooms are very large and the end number of the room is also the birthday number. This is very meticulous! You can definitely walk to the food court within 5 minutes, and the beach may be within 10 minutes, but there are battery cars. The swimming pool is large, clean and free of odors.

Disadvantages: The restaurant is average. Of course, the price is completely affordable. It is indeed old and in disrepair. The room layout is old and worn out. However, the yard environment and swimming pool are still well maintained and very popular.

To tell the truth, I think the swimming pool in the hotel is much more comfortable than the seaside, and it is clean, spacious and comfortable, so suitable for vacation. There are also many dining options

Duty-free shop has a shuttle bus (there is also a 9.5 discount)
The Chinese food in the restaurant is delicious, the seafood is fresh, the taste is pure, clean and comfortable, after eating, go to the room to sleep or swim, as a lazy and comfortable tour, you can go shopping nearby without leaving the hotel.

msg:The hotel is opposite to the Yalong Bay Marriott and not facing the sea. It looks a bit old because the hotel has been running for a long time, but the overall environment in the hotel park is pretty good. You can see the intentions of the year.
Let‚Äôs talk about the environment and services: In fact, there are several public swimming pools in the hotel and there are water slides, but I don‚Äôt know why the small swimming pool in the villa area is abandoned, and the water slides are not used and the entire large swimming pool has not been repaired. Several poolside bars are not staffed. The sanitary housekeeping of the villa can only be said that the bedroom can be disturbed, but the living room is really messed up. There is a huge dead cockroach in the children's tent, but someone else is in charge! To put it bluntly, the living room does not have any service facilities except for the furniture. It can be seen that operation cost reduction is everywhere haha. Focus on the internal connection of the hotel park! You must take a battery car in the villa area. To be honest, there were only two cars in the hotel during the eleventh period. I waited for half an hour when I called for a car during the first dinner. I told the front desk that there was no change in the response time. Because the children at home often use the car or the driver Xiao Zhou took the initiative to help me solve the problem. I want to focus on commending Comrade Xiao Zhou, haha, thank you!
Finally, let‚Äôs summarize! This hotel is now booking the villa area to basically take pictures and pretend to be taken. The hotel has fully considered and specially prepared the net celebrity floating afternoon tea. This is very good, and you can consider it if you need it. Family travel, to be honest, there are too many options for pool villas at the same price in Sanya. The price/performance ratio here is not high.

Five-star service. Nola at the front desk was very enthusiastic to help us check in, understand our check-in needs, and helped us upgrade the Nanyang Villa, and delivered fresh fruits every day. Road to the hotel cleaning aunt, they are very happy to greet you. The little brother who drives the shuttle bus turns off his lights when he meets pedestrians at night, and asks if he needs a car every time he encounters him. Therefore, every member of the hotel is very enthusiastic, attentive and happy to serve tourists.

Nanyang Villa is a villa with independent pool, with good privacy and a layer of bamboo on the outer wall. The building and interior of the villa are in Nanyang style. The interior is mostly wooden furniture. The style is simple but the facilities are absolutely complete. There is an independent swimming pool in the yard. It is very comfortable to swim in the blue sky and blue water. Every day there will be someone to clean up the garbage in the pool. The dining area is equipped with a refrigerator and an electric kettle with a variety of coffee and tea. The private bathroom is equipped with a shower, a double bathtub and a hairdryer. The dry and wet are separated, and the bathroom is separated.

The theme style of the hotel is Southeast Asian style. The styles of Southeast Asia, Thailand and Myanmar can be seen everywhere. The Southeast Asian architecture of the public swimming pool is very realistic and photographable. There are various kayaks and other net celebrity boats in the public swimming pool. It is as if you are in Southeast Asia, and you can shoot everywhere in green trees and small lakes.

The hotel does not rely on the beach. There is a shuttle bus at a designated point. It is less than a five-minute drive. You can also walk through the Marriott Hotel to reach the beach. The sandy beach in Yalong Bay is fine and clean, and there are various water sports to play.

There is a food court near the hotel, and you can find a business to pick you up for free like a little dolphin. The same store will be more expensive than Sanya Bay. Or go to Bohoucun Night Market to eat local snacks and early stalls, which are inexpensive and can taste the local flavors of Sanya.

msg:On this trip, we stayed at the Pullman Sanya Yalong Bay. Before arriving at the hotel, the service manager Mr. Zhang Nan contacted us in advance and asked us if we had any needs and services. We felt very considerate.
üîîService: There are shuttle buses to and from the hotel to the housing area, which is very convenient
üöó Transportation: The location is excellent, only seven or eight minutes‚Äô drive from the beach.
üçÉEnvironment: This time I stayed in the Nanyang Villa. It has its own swimming pool and a bathtub. The environment is very comfortable.
 The hotel's breakfast is very good, rich in variety and complete dishes
The lady at the front desk, other staff, and Mr. Zhang Nan all provided very considerate services and upgraded our room type for free.

Overall, this hotel experience was very good and I will consider choosing it again in the futureüëç

He asked us about the room needs in advance and upgraded us to a pool villa for free. I was very pleasantly surprised. The environment of the villa is very elegant, and the water in the private swimming pool is very clean, which is very suitable for a day of soaking in it. The environment of the entire hotel is great, Southeast Asian style, nice scenery, and there are also parent-child activities.

The entire hotel has a large area, beautiful landscape planning, lush vegetation, not many mosquitoes, and good killing. The rooms are a bit old, but the functional partitions are reasonable and easy to use. The best thing is, of course, the villa swimming pool, where the kids have fun. There is Dongrong Food City 200 meters to the left of the house. It is very close. I ate at 5 different restaurants, each of which has exquisite dishes and reasonable prices. The supermarket on the first floor is small and complete, so you don't need to bring your own daily chemicals.

For example, when you go to a duty-free shop, you must come to the front desk to make an appoin**ent one day in advance and before 6 o'clock.

msg:The hotel is generally very good.
       We lived in a Thai-style villa, the villa was cleaned very clean, the air-conditioning was also very good, the bed was comfortable, and the mosquito nets were also unique. No mosquito was seen in the bedroom room. As long as you don't keep the landing door open, there are basically no bugs to bother you. Although I brought a liquid mosquito coil, it didn't help much. The living room and dining room are in another room, and the air-conditioning is also powerful. It is very practical to invite friends to gather together. That night the hotel waiter actively came to take away the food waste. If you need to open the sliding door frequently in the living room, it is still recommended to prepare electric mosquito coils, but it is not recommended to keep the door open as it is easy to attract insects. A clothes rail is intimately provided in the villa, which is great!
        If you are traveling with children, the pool villa is highly recommended! The swimming pool is large, the children have a great time, and the water is clean. One day, there was a strong wind. Because there was a big tree by the pool, some leaves were blown into the pool, and the room service quickly sent someone to deal with it. In fact, I think it is normal for the leaves to fall. Fortunately, there is this big tree by the pool, otherwise we will not be able to start enjoying the pool at 2pm.
        The villa area of the hotel has a very good environment, and there are many landscape designs that are great. It is also a pleasure to walk to the lobby in the morning. Room service responds very quickly, usually in the room to call a car, can be reached within 3 to 5 minutes. It is not easy to help transport inflatable swimming rings in large swimming pools!
         The hotel service is also good. I often ask if I need help, or if I have any needs, and will take the initiative to introduce key information such as the hotel beach shuttle.
        The food is not very good, rather ordinary. If this aspect is strengthened, the hotel will feel better.

The environment in the villa area is quite good, and the private swimming pool is also suitable for my children who like to play in the water. Basically, they have to soak for more than five or six hours every day. The food in the hotel is so-so, with a little less variety. We stayed for a total of six or seven days. Basically, we bought the villa package promoted by the hotel, which included a meal for two at the Milan Fragrant Restaurant, but it was too monotonous to eat the same content every day. I hope that the package will provide more in the future. Meal choices. The service efficiency of the front desk and shuttle bus is relatively low. It feels that other hotels can handle things in a fraction of the time. The ladies at the front desk of Pullman will spend more time slowly. It really feels like a waste of time. It would be even better if the hotel can be trained and improved in this regard! Of course, there are also some highlights in the hotel's service. Uncle Bill who manages the pool in the villa area is very good, very kind and enthusiastic! There is also Alice at Milan Xiang Restaurant who is also very good. Although she is new here, she has a positive attitude and attentiveness! These two should be regarded as highlights of Pullman's not-so-great service.

My child said he would come to Pullman next time, and hope the hotel will get better and better!

One room has a large bed and a small bed, and the other room has a dining table, a small sofa, and a small children‚Äôs tent. Basically, children enjoy the swimming pool all the way, so this cottage is me. Used to store luggage.
There is a small white car to and from the villa area to and from the lobby, so you must call in advance, otherwise you will have to wait a long time.
Then, the parent-child rooms are all on the first floor, and the balcony directly enters the swimming pool. This design is really good. Generally speaking, it is one less house than the villa, but it is more spacious and has no independent swimming pool.
Special thanks to the room service, Jia Guiyun and Zhao Haixia, the service is really great, because there are children, they specially prepare toiletries for the children, and help to fold the quilt during the day, and the pajamas they bring are neatly folded. I still have to thank nicole, knowing that the child is celebrating his birthday, I specially gave a cake üç∞ on that day. muah. that's nice. Warm your heart.
The environment in the entire park is very good, with small mushrooms, ducks and water birds.
The breakfast is rich, bread jam, fried dough soy milk, stir-fried rice noodles, there are many styles, I can't say all of them.
During the day, there is a shuttle bus that runs every half an hour to the beach, and then to the beach in five minutes. Otherwise, you may have to walk through the Marriott Hotel.
If you go to other places, you can also ask in advance if there is a shuttle bus, such as Atlantis. We didn't ask, it took a lot to take a taxi.
You can play various activities on the beach, and the driver will introduce it when the time comes. It is probably a cooperation with the hotel. There are exclusive Pullman lounge chairs on the beach, but I seem to lie down casually hahaha. For those who like to play sports, beach balance bikes, sailing boats, glass boats, Mediterranean diving, snorkeling, all you can play. It's quite diverse. We played diving, the artificial fish pond, which is said to be 15 meters deep, can feed fish, 20 bottles of fish food, the price is not low, it depends on personal preference.
The hotel has an airport drop-off service, bee company, forgot what company. When you make the reservation, you must tell your child that you need a seat in advance, otherwise I will have a numb leg holding my five-year-old child for an hour. It's still hot.
The hotel has a swimming ring inflatable service, 10 yuan for the big ring and 5 yuan for the small one.
Basically that's it. Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is very high, after all, family rooms are more expensive.
Finally, I will talk about some shortcomings that I feel, and I hope they can be improved. One is that the shower room is made of transparent glass, which is really inconvenient for families with children. At the age of five, the gender has been distinguished, and the opposite sex can be seen clearly when taking a bath, so the child must be taken away and taken quickly. Flustered.
The second is that the mattress is really soft, too soft, I don‚Äôt like it but the child likes it, it‚Äôs big enough.
Thanks to the staff at Pullman, nicole, Zhao Haixia, and Jia Guiyun, I wish you a happy life and success in your work.
I can always see small geckos and big snails. They are very cute and the children are super excited.

It is my favorite Southeast Asian architectural garden style. Although it is a bit old, the decoration quality and materials are first-class.
The layout and lighting design of the villa are perfect. Attention to detail, this is definitely a luxury hotel. The small bathroom accessories are particularly easy to use. There is an outdoor swimming pool, very private, and it feels so refreshing!

msg:If I live in a non- villa room type, I feel that the price is not high. The hotel facilities are slightly old, the check-in efficiency is very low, the first check-in has been more than an hour, arranged in the air conditioner outside the outlet, the noise is very loud, after the next day of communication, help us upgrade the villa room, the villa room is very comfortable, But also stayed for more than two hours.
The afternoon tea was supposed to be the icing on the cake. The results were general. It reflected that the tiramisu was not good and wanted to change other cakes at the same price. It was refused directly. It could only be said that there was basically no service. The waiter was not there, or he was playing with his mobile phone. The chicken wing five-star hotel is still not cooked in the afternoon. I want to reflect that I can't find anyone. Overall, I was more disappointed than expected. So if I can consider staying in the villa, other room types are not recommended, but the hotel should focus on improving the service of the young waiter.
